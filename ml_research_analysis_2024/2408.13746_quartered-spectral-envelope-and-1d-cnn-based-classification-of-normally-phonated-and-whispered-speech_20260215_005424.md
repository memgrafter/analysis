# Quartered Spectral Envelope and 1D-CNN-based Classification of Normally Phonated and Whispered Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13746
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13746
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Achieves 99.31% accuracy on wTIMIT and 100% on CHAINS using quartered spectral envelope features with 1D-CNN

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a whispered vs. normal speech classification system based on quartered spectral envelope (QSE) features and 1D-CNN. The key insight is that pitch harmonics, prominent in normal speech but absent in whispered speech, are concentrated in the first quarter of the spectrum. By extracting this QSE feature and using 1D-CNN to learn its patterns, the system achieves high accuracy with lower computational overhead than state-of-the-art LSTM approaches. The method is robust to white noise and outperforms MFCC-based systems.

## Method Summary
The system extracts quartered spectral envelope features from the first 128 bins of a 1024-point FFT, focusing on the frequency range where pitch harmonics are most prominent. A 1D-CNN architecture with two convolutional blocks (32 and 64 filters) processes these features, followed by dense and dropout layers. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer on parallel normal and whispered speech datasets. Evaluation is performed at the utterance level by averaging frame posteriors.

## Key Results
- 99.31% classification accuracy on wTIMIT corpus
- 100% classification accuracy on CHAINS corpus
- Superior performance compared to MFCC and LFBE features with LSTM
- Robust to white noise degradation at 0dB, 5dB, and 10dB SNR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Pitch harmonics are concentrated in the first quarter of the spectrum
- The spectral envelope in the first quarter contains most discriminative information
- Core assumption: Fourier transform preserves pitch harmonic information predictably
- Evidence: Observations from spectral analysis of normal vs. whispered speech
- Break condition: If harmonics are distributed differently or whispered speech has unexpected harmonic content

### Mechanism 2
- 1D-CNN effectively learns patterns from QSE features
- Convolutional filters capture pitch harmonic shapes and prominence
- Core assumption: Appropriate kernel sizes cover harmonic peaks without smoothing
- Evidence: Architecture design and empirical results
- Break condition: If kernel sizes are mismatched to harmonic patterns

### Mechanism 3
- Quartering improves computational efficiency and accuracy
- Feature selection reduces data requirements and complexity
- Core assumption: Higher frequencies contribute insignificantly to classification
- Evidence: Performance benefits from reduced input dimensions
- Break condition: If higher frequencies contain important discriminative features

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spectral envelope and pitch harmonics
  - Why needed: Understanding how harmonics manifest in spectral envelope
  - Quick check: How do pitch harmonics affect spectral envelope in normal vs. whispered speech?

- Concept: 1D-CNN architecture and convolutions
  - Why needed: Understanding frequency-domain processing across spectral data
  - Quick check: Why perform 1D convolution across frequency rather than time?

- Concept: Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed: Understanding trade-offs between efficiency and performance
  - Quick check: What are benefits and drawbacks of quartering spectral input?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: STFT → QSE extraction → 1D-CNN conv+pool → Dense layers → Classification output
- Critical path: STFT → QSE extraction → 1D-CNN convolution and pooling → Dense layers → Classification output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Kernel size vs. harmonic capture: Too large smooths, too small misses patterns
  - Sampling rate impact: 16kHz better than 44.1kHz due to fewer harmonics in lower range
  - Dimensionality vs. efficiency: Quartering reduces requirements but may discard information
- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy < 90%: Kernel size issues, sampling rate problems, or feature extraction errors
  - High false positives: Model overfitting to normal speech characteristics
  - Slow convergence: Need more training data or architecture adjustments
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test kernel sizes (10, 20, 30) to find optimal harmonic shape capture
  2. Compare 16kHz vs 44.1kHz sampling rates to verify quartering hypothesis
  3. Evaluate QSE features from different spectrum quarters to confirm first quarter superiority

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the system perform with complex noise types beyond white noise?
- What is the real-time classification performance in terms of latency and efficiency?
- How does performance vary across different languages or phonetic contexts?

## Limitations
- Pitch harmonic concentration in first quarter is assumed rather than rigorously validated
- Kernel size selection appears somewhat heuristic without systematic justification
- Computational efficiency claims lack direct comparison metrics against LSTM baselines

## Confidence
- High confidence: Classification accuracy results; white noise robustness
- Medium confidence: Pitch harmonic concentration mechanism; 1D-CNN learning effectiveness
- Low confidence: Computational complexity comparisons; generalizability to non-parallel datasets

## Next Checks
1. Analyze harmonic energy distribution across all four spectral quarters to validate concentration hypothesis
2. Perform ablation studies with different kernel sizes (5x1, 15x1, 25x1) to identify optimal ranges
3. Measure actual FLOPs and training/inference times for both QSE-1D-CNN and LSTM baselines
