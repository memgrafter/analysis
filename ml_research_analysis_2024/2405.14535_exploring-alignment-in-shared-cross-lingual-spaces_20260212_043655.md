# Exploring Alignment in Shared Cross-lingual Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14535
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14535
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: This work introduces two metrics, CALIGN and COLAP, to quantify the alignment and overlap of latent concepts across languages in multilingual models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two novel metrics, CALIGN and COLAP, to quantify cross-lingual alignment and overlap of latent concepts in multilingual models. The authors employ clustering to uncover latent concepts in contextualized representations and analyze their alignment and overlap across various languages and model layers. Their analysis spans three multilingual models (mT5, mBERT, XLM-R) and three downstream tasks (Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis), revealing important insights about how multilingual representations evolve across layers and through fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The authors use K-means clustering to discover latent concepts from contextualized representations generated by multilingual models. They then compute two metrics: CALIGN (Concept Alignment) measures the degree to which concepts in one language align with semantically equivalent concepts in another language using translation dictionaries, while COLAP (Concept Overlap) quantifies whether concepts contain words from multiple languages in close latent space. The analysis examines how these metrics vary across different model layers, between base and fine-tuned models, and across language pairs with different degrees of relatedness.

## Key Results
- Deeper layers in multilingual models demonstrate increased cross-lingual alignment due to the presence of language-agnostic semantic concepts
- Fine-tuning enhances alignment within the latent space and explains the emergence of zero-shot capabilities
- Closely related languages (e.g., English-French) exhibit higher overlap in latent space compared to distantly related languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deeper layers in multilingual models exhibit increased alignment due to presence of language-agnostic semantic concepts.
- Mechanism: As neural networks process information, lower layers capture language-specific lexical features while higher layers abstract to language-agnostic semantic representations.
- Core assumption: The hierarchical structure of neural networks inherently separates lexical from semantic processing.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.1]

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning calibrates the latent space towards higher alignment and facilitates zero-shot capabilities.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks optimizes the latent space for task-specific concepts, which often align better across languages.
- Core assumption: Task-specific optimization naturally leads to alignment of latent representations across languages.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.1]

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Closely related languages demonstrate higher overlap in latent space due to shared linguistic features.
- Mechanism: Languages with shared linguistic heritage have more overlapping latent representations because their features have historical connections.
- Core assumption: Linguistic similarity between languages leads to greater overlap in their latent representations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.2]

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent Concept Discovery
  - Why needed here: The entire analysis depends on identifying and quantifying latent concepts within multilingual models.
  - Quick check question: How does K-means clustering help in discovering latent concepts from contextualized representations?

- Concept: Cross-Lingual Alignment
  - Why needed here: The CALIGN metric measures how well concepts in one language align with semantically equivalent concepts in another language.
  - Quick check question: What threshold parameter controls the extent of alignment in the CALIGN metric?

- Concept: Multilingual Concept Overlap
  - Why needed here: The COLAP metric investigates whether concepts contain words from multiple languages in close latent space.
  - Quick check question: What threshold determines whether a concept is considered multilingual or overlapping in the COLAP metric?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clustering Module -> CALIGN Metric Calculator -> COLAP Metric Calculator -> Data Pipeline -> Visualization Tools
- Critical path:
  1. Generate contextualized representations from multilingual models
  2. Apply clustering to discover latent concepts
  3. Calculate CALIGN and COLAP metrics
  4. Analyze results across different layers, languages, and model states
  5. Visualize and interpret findings

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Clustering granularity (K value) vs. computational efficiency
  - Alignment threshold (θA) vs. sensitivity to noise
  - Overlap threshold (θO) vs. capturing true multilingual concepts
  - Number of best translations vs. alignment accuracy
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuned analysis for understanding model behavior

- Failure signatures:
  - Low CALIGN scores across all layers may indicate poor cross-lingual alignment
  - Unexpected patterns in zero-shot vs. fine-tuned alignment could suggest issues with concept discovery
  - High overlap in unrelated language pairs might indicate concept clustering issues
  - Inconsistent results across different threshold settings may suggest instability in the metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run concept discovery on a small multilingual dataset and verify that clusters contain semantically coherent concepts across languages
  2. Calculate CALIGN for a base model and compare alignment patterns across different layers
  3. Fine-tune a model on a downstream task and measure the change in CALIGN and COLAP

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different clustering algorithms compare to K-means in identifying meaningful latent concepts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that Hawasly et al. (2024) showed K-means to be a viable alternative to agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the performance of different clustering algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using various clustering algorithms and comparing the resulting latent concepts in terms of interpretability, alignment, and overlap.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do CALIGN and COLAP metrics correlate with multilingual model performance on downstream tasks in zero-shot scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows alignment improvements post-fine-tuning correlate with better zero-shot performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not establish a direct causal relationship between the metrics and downstream task performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Measuring correlation between CALIGN/COLAP scores and zero-shot performance across different tasks and language pairs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of parallel data affect alignment and overlap of latent concepts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that parallel data across languages is used to obtain encoded concepts.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the impact of different parallel data choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different parallel datasets and analyzing the resulting latent concepts.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do discovered latent concepts relate to the model's internal decision-making process during inference?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on discovering concepts but does not investigate their utilization during inference.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how discovered concepts contribute to predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating concept discovery with ablation studies or knowledge attribution methods.

## Limitations
- Potential instability in clustering process due to high-dimensional representations
- Sensitivity of alignment metrics to threshold parameters
- Analysis limited to only three multilingual models and three tasks

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The observation that deeper layers show increased cross-lingual alignment is well-supported by hierarchical processing theory and empirical evidence.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim about fine-tuning enhancing alignment and explaining zero-shot capabilities has moderate support but requires more rigorous analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the alignment (θA) and overlap (θO) thresholds to determine their impact on CALIGN and COLAP metrics and establish robustness ranges.
2. Compare K-means clustering results with other clustering methods to verify that discovered latent concepts are stable and not artifacts of the clustering algorithm.
3. Conduct controlled experiments to directly measure the correlation between CALIGN improvements and zero-shot performance gains across different tasks.
