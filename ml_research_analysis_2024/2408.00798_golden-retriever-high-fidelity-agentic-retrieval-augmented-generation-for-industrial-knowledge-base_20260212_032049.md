- Primary result: Improves RAG accuracy by resolving jargon ambiguity through reflection-based question augmentation

## Executive Summary
Golden-Retriever introduces a novel reflection-based question augmentation step before document retrieval in RAG systems to improve accuracy in industrial knowledge bases. The method identifies domain-specific jargon and abbreviations in user questions, determines their context, queries a jargon dictionary for definitions, and augments the question with this information. This approach addresses the challenge of ambiguous domain-specific terms that cause traditional RAG systems to retrieve irrelevant documents. Evaluation shows significant improvements over baseline methods, with average accuracy gains of 57.3% over vanilla LLM and 35.0% over RAG.

## Method Summary
Golden-Retriever enhances traditional RAG systems by adding a pre-retrieval augmentation step that resolves jargon ambiguity through LLM-driven reflection. The system first identifies domain-specific terms in user questions, determines their context from predefined categories, queries a jargon dictionary for definitions, and augments the original question with this information. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities. The method also includes an offline LLM-driven document augmentation step that summarizes document chunks from a domain expert perspective to create semantically rich content for better retrieval matching.

## Key Results
- Golden-Retriever improves answer accuracy by an average of 57.3% over vanilla LLM baseline
- Shows 35.0% improvement over traditional RAG systems on domain-specific question-answer datasets
- Meta-Llama-3-70B demonstrates the highest improvement at 79.2% over baseline LLM performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reflection-based question augmentation resolves jargon ambiguity before document retrieval.
- Mechanism: The system identifies domain-specific terms in the user's question, determines their context, and augments the question with precise definitions from a jargon dictionary before passing it to the RAG framework.
- Core assumption: Jargon ambiguity is the primary cause of poor retrieval performance in domain-specific knowledge bases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy."
  - [section 3.2-3.5] Describes the three-step process: identify jargon, identify context, augment question with definitions.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on RAG systems but don't specifically address pre-retrieval jargon resolution.
- Break condition: If jargon identification fails or the jargon dictionary lacks coverage of domain terms, the augmentation will be incomplete or incorrect.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-driven document augmentation improves retrieval relevance by enhancing semantic understanding.
- Mechanism: During offline processing, LLMs summarize document chunks from a domain expert perspective, creating semantically rich content that better matches user queries.
- Core assumption: Raw document chunks lack sufficient semantic coherence for effective retrieval.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "This augmented data is added to the document database, making it more likely to retrieve relevant documents when queried."
  - [section 3.1] Describes using OCR, chunking, and LLM summarization to create enhanced document representations.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers mention RAG improvements but don't specifically discuss LLM-driven document augmentation.
- Break condition: If the LLM summarization fails to capture domain-specific nuances or introduces irrelevant information, retrieval performance may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Context identification prevents misinterpretation of ambiguous terms across different domains.
- Mechanism: The system identifies the context of the question from predefined categories, ensuring jargon is interpreted correctly based on domain-specific meaning.
- Core assumption: The same term can have different meanings in different technical contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "To accurately interpret the context, we use a similar reflection step as in jargon identification... The identified context is then stored and accessed by the main program for further processing."
  - [section 3.3] Provides example: "RAG" could mean "Retrieval Augmented Generation" in LLMs or "Recombination-Activating Gene" in genetics.
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related papers discuss context-aware RAG systems but not the specific approach of context identification before retrieval.
- Break condition: If the context identification step incorrectly categorizes the question, jargon interpretation will be wrong even with correct definitions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
  - Why needed here: Documents come in various formats including slides and images with embedded text that require text extraction before processing.
  - Quick check question: What preprocessing step converts image-based documents into text for further analysis?

- Concept: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Golden-Retriever builds upon RAG by adding a pre-retrieval augmentation step to improve document retrieval accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of a standard RAG system?

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: Used in context identification to guide the LLM toward structured responses that improve context classification accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What prompting technique helps LLMs reason through multi-step problems by showing intermediate reasoning steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Offline pipeline: OCR → Document chunking → LLM summarization → Enhanced document database
  - Online pipeline: Question input → Jargon identification → Context identification → Jargon query → Question augmentation → RAG retrieval → Answer generation
  - Supporting components: Jargon dictionary (SQL database), LLM backend, temporary storage for intermediate results

- Critical path: Question → Jargon identification → Context identification → Jargon query → Question augmentation → Document retrieval → Answer generation
  - Each step depends on successful completion of the previous step; failure in early steps cascades through the system.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM-based vs rule-based approaches: Higher computational cost but greater flexibility in handling new jargon
  - SQL query synthesis vs LLM-generated SQL: Ensures query safety and reliability at the cost of flexibility
  - Context identification through LLMs vs text classifiers: Avoids need for training data but increases inference costs

- Failure signatures:
  - Empty jargon list: System proceeds without augmentation, potentially missing retrieval improvements
  - Context identification failure: Jargon may be misinterpreted, leading to irrelevant document retrieval
  - Jargon dictionary miss: System generates fallback response indicating missing information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test jargon identification accuracy with synthetic questions containing known abbreviations across different LLM models
  2. Evaluate context identification accuracy by presenting domain-specific questions and verifying correct context categorization
  3. Measure end-to-end performance improvement by comparing answer accuracy with and without question augmentation on domain-specific QA datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Golden-Retriever's reflection-based question augmentation handle multi-word abbreviations or jargon terms that require contextual understanding beyond simple dictionary lookups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes extracting jargon and abbreviations, querying a jargon dictionary, and augmenting questions with definitions, but doesn't detail how complex multi-word terms are processed
- Why unresolved: The method description focuses on single-word abbreviations and simple dictionary lookups, but many industrial terms are multi-word phrases that require deeper contextual understanding
- What evidence would resolve it: Examples of Golden-Retriever processing multi-word technical terms like "Peripheral Under Cell" or "Recombination-Activating Gene" would demonstrate how the system handles complex jargon

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational overhead introduced by Golden-Retriever's reflection-based question augmentation compared to traditional RAG systems, and how does this impact real-time query performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "higher computational costs" for the LLM-based approach but doesn't provide quantitative measurements of latency or resource usage
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates improved accuracy, it doesn't address the trade-off between accuracy gains and increased computational requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark data showing query processing times and resource usage for Golden-Retriever versus baseline RAG systems would clarify the performance trade-offs

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Golden-Retriever handle domain-specific jargon that evolves over time, and what mechanisms exist for updating the jargon dictionary without retraining the entire system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that unidentified jargon triggers a fallback mechanism instructing users to contact the knowledge base manager to add new terms
- Why unresolved: The paper describes the fallback mechanism but doesn't detail how the system learns from these user interactions or automatically updates its knowledge base
- What evidence would resolve it: Documentation of the system's learning mechanisms for incorporating new jargon terms and measuring the time between initial user requests and successful incorporation into the knowledge base

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic question-answer datasets rather than real-world user queries
- Domain specificity of the jargon dictionary is unclear, potentially limiting augmentation effectiveness
- Computational overhead of LLM-based reflection steps may impact practical deployment in production environments

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core mechanism of pre-retrieval question augmentation to address jargon ambiguity is well-supported by the described methodology and evaluation results showing 35-79% improvements over baselines.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that LLM-driven document augmentation improves retrieval relevance is supported by the methodology but lacks direct experimental validation comparing retrieval performance with and without document augmentation.
- Medium Confidence: The context identification mechanism's effectiveness is demonstrated through methodology description but requires further validation with edge cases where terms have multiple valid interpretations across domains.

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world query testing:** Evaluate Golden-Retriever performance using actual user query logs from industrial knowledge bases rather than synthetic datasets to assess practical effectiveness.
2. **Ablation study on components:** Test system performance with individual components disabled (e.g., document augmentation only, question augmentation only) to quantify each component's contribution to overall improvement.
3. **Scalability assessment:** Measure the computational overhead and latency impact of the reflection-based augmentation steps when processing high-volume query traffic typical of industrial knowledge bases.
