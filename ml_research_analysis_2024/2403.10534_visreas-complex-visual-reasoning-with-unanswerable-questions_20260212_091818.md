## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VISREAS, a new visual reasoning dataset designed to test models on their ability to validate question answerability before answering. Unlike previous datasets that assume every question has an answer, VISREAS includes unanswerable questions generated by perturbing object attributes and relations in scene graphs. The dataset contains 2.07M unique questions covering diverse reasoning types such as querying, comparing, counting, verifying, and choosing. To address the challenges posed by VISREAS, the authors propose LOGIC2VISION, a modular model that generates and executes pseudocode to reason over images step-by-step.

## Method Summary
The VISREAS dataset is constructed by generating questions from Visual Genome scene graphs, including answerable and unanswerable queries created by perturbing object attributes and relations. The LOGIC2VISION model consists of two stages: pseudocode generation and pseudocode-guided reasoning. First, a VICUNA model generates pseudocode outlining the reasoning steps needed to answer a question. Then, the LLaVA-1.5 VLM executes these steps sequentially using the image to produce the final answer. This approach decomposes complex visual reasoning into manageable steps while enforcing validation of question-answerability at each stage.

## Key Results
- LOGIC2VISION achieves 66.20% accuracy on VISREAS, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models
- The model shows +4.82% improvement over LLaVA-1.5 and +12.23% over InstructBLIP
- Performance varies across reasoning types, with query and compare questions being more challenging than counting or verification tasks
- LOGIC2VISION demonstrates better handling of problematic questions (those with incorrect relations) compared to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LOGIC2VISION improves performance by generating and executing pseudocode for each question step-by-step.
- Mechanism: The model first produces pseudocode outlining reasoning steps, then executes them sequentially using the image. This decomposes the problem into manageable parts, allowing verification at each step.
- Core assumption: VLMs can reliably generate correct pseudocode for a given question, and this pseudocode accurately represents the reasoning needed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LOGIC2VISION that reasons by producing and executing pseudocode without any external modules to generate the answer"
  - [section 4.2]: "Since the Pseudocode Generation module outlines the necessary steps to answer the question, the remaining task is to perform pseudocode-guided sequential reasoning on the image."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: VISREAS enforces models to verify the consistency of question text with the image in each reasoning step before predicting an answer.
- Mechanism: The dataset includes unanswerable questions generated by perturbing object attributes and relations in scene graphs. Models must check the validity of each object, attribute, and relation mentioned in the question against the image before answering.
- Core assumption: The scene graph annotations accurately capture the objects, attributes, and relations present in the images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Unlike previous datasets that assume every question has an answer, VISREAS includes unanswerable questions generated by perturbing object attributes and relations in scene graphs."
  - [section 3.1.3]: "If any intermediate reasoning step results in 'NONE', the final answer becomes 'the question itself is problematic' indicating some objects, relations, or attributes mentioned in the question text cannot be found in the image."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LOGIC2VISION leverages the reasoning capabilities of visual language models without relying on external modules.
- Mechanism: Instead of using external APIs for object detection, counting, or arithmetic, LOGIC2VISION uses a single VLM (LLaVA-1.5) to both generate pseudocode and execute the reasoning steps using the image.
- Core assumption: The VLM has sufficient reasoning capabilities to perform the required operations when given appropriate pseudocode and image context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LOGIC2VISION that reasons by producing and executing pseudocode without any external modules to generate the answer"
  - [section 4.2]: "For this stage, we choose state-of-the-art VLM, LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023), due to its impressive performance in diverse reasoning tasks."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Visual reasoning
  - Why needed here: VISREAS requires models to reason about objects, their attributes, and relations in images to answer complex questions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how to determine if a question about an image is answerable or not?

- Concept: Scene graphs
  - Why needed here: VISREAS uses scene graphs to generate questions and provide structured representations of images.
  - Quick check question: What are the main components of a scene graph and how are they used to represent an image?

- Concept: Pseudocode generation
  - Why needed here: LOGIC2VISION generates pseudocode to outline the reasoning steps needed to answer a question.
  - Quick check question: How would you convert a natural language question into a series of executable pseudocode steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question → Pseudocode Generation → Pseudocode-Guided Reasoning → Answer
- Critical path: Question flows to pseudocode generation, which produces reasoning steps that are executed on the image to produce the final answer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a single VLM for both pseudocode generation and reasoning execution simplifies the architecture but may limit performance compared to using specialized models for each task
  - Generating and executing pseudocode step-by-step allows for verification at each step but may be slower than end-to-end reasoning
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect or incomplete pseudocode generation leading to wrong answers
  - VLM failing to execute reasoning steps correctly, especially for complex operations
  - Over-reliance on the image context leading to hallucinations or incorrect object/attribute/relation identification
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test pseudocode generation on a held-out set of questions from the training data to ensure the model can accurately outline reasoning steps
  2. Test pseudocode-guided reasoning on a small set of questions with known answers to verify the VLM can execute the steps correctly
  3. Evaluate the full LOGIC2VISION model on a validation set of VISREAS questions to assess overall performance and identify any failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LOGIC2VISION's performance change when trained with pseudocode generated by different models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that LOGIC2VISION uses pseudocode generated by VICUNA-13B, but also notes that GPT-4V outperforms other models on certain question types.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the impact of using pseudocode from different models on LOGIC2VISION's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing LOGIC2VISION's performance when trained with pseudocode generated by different models, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or other large language models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does LOGIC2VISION's performance scale with the number of reasoning steps in the pseudocode?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces pseudocode-guided reasoning but doesn't analyze how the length of the reasoning chain affects model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide insights into whether longer reasoning chains impact LOGIC2VISION's accuracy or computational efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring LOGIC2VISION's accuracy and inference time as the number of reasoning steps in the pseudocode increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is LOGIC2VISION to errors in the pseudocode generation stage?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents LOGIC2VISION as a two-stage model but doesn't analyze the impact of erroneous pseudocode on final answer quality.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate how inaccuracies in the generated pseudocode affect the model's ability to produce correct answers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments injecting controlled errors into the pseudocode and measuring the downstream impact on LOGIC2VISION's answer accuracy.

## Limitations

- The primary limitation lies in the reliance on scene graph annotations for question generation, which may be inaccurate or incomplete
- Performance gains are demonstrated primarily against generative and classification models, with less emphasis on comparison with other structured reasoning approaches
- The evaluation focuses on accuracy metrics without deeper analysis of failure modes or error patterns

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mechanism by which LOGIC2VISION decomposes problems through pseudocode generation and execution is well-supported by experimental results. The claim that VISREAS enforces answerability validation is strongly evidenced by the dataset construction methodology and evaluation results.

**Medium confidence**: The comparative performance claims (+4.82% over LLaVA-1.5, +12.23% over InstructBLIP) are well-supported, but the reasons for these specific improvements are less clear. The study doesn't provide detailed ablation studies to isolate which components of LOGIC2VISION contribute most to performance gains.

**Low confidence**: The assumption that scene graph annotations accurately capture all relevant image information is not empirically validated. The study assumes perfect annotation quality without testing how annotation errors might affect model performance or question validity.

## Next Checks

1. **Scene graph annotation validation**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of scene graph annotation quality by having human annotators verify a random sample of annotations against their corresponding images, measuring precision and recall for object, attribute, and relation annotations.

2. **Ablation study of LOGIC2VISION components**: Test variants of LOGIC2VISION where either pseudocode generation or execution is replaced with alternative approaches (e.g., using specialized modules instead of the VLM for certain operations) to quantify the contribution of each component to overall performance.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluate LOGIC2VISION on other visual reasoning datasets that don't use scene graphs for question generation to assess whether the pseudocode-guided reasoning approach generalizes beyond the VISREAS dataset structure.
