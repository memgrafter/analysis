# wav2graph: A Framework for Supervised Learning Knowledge Graph from Speech

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.04174
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04174
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First framework for supervised learning of knowledge graphs directly from speech data

## Executive Summary
wav2graph introduces the first framework for constructing and training knowledge graphs directly from speech data. The framework converts spoken utterances into structured graph representations, then applies graph neural networks for node classification and link prediction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that multilingual LLM text embeddings significantly outperform other approaches for node classification on ASR-transcribed speech, while link prediction on ASR transcripts often surpasses performance on human transcripts despite high word error rates of 28.8% and 29%.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs knowledge graphs from transcribed speech utterances and named entity databases, converts these graphs into embedding vectors, and trains graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification and link prediction. The method involves ASR pre-training with wav2vec 2.0, KG construction from transcriptions and named entities, node embedding generation using various pre-trained models, and GNN training with architectures like SAGE, GCN, GAT, and SuperGAT. Experiments use human transcripts and ASR transcripts with varying embeddings (random, encoder-based, decoder-based) across monolingual and multilingual acoustic pre-training conditions.

## Key Results
- Multilingual LLM text embeddings significantly outperform other embeddings in node classification on multilingual acoustic pre-trained ASR transcripts
- Node classification on ASR transcripts achieves competitive results compared to human transcripts despite high WERs of 28.8% and 29%
- Link prediction on ASR transcripts generally outperforms link prediction on human transcripts despite the same high WERs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multilingual LLM text embeddings significantly outperform other embeddings in node classification tasks when applied to multilingual acoustic pre-trained ASR transcripts.
- **Mechanism:** The multilingual LLM embeddings capture richer semantic context and generalize better across languages, which compensates for the noise introduced by ASR errors. This allows the GNNs to maintain high classification accuracy even with high word error rates (WERs).
- **Core assumption:** The semantic richness and generalization capability of multilingual LLM embeddings are sufficient to overcome the noise from ASR transcripts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "multilingual LLM text embeddings significantly outperform other embeddings in node classification tasks when applied to multilingual acoustic pre-training ASR transcripts."
  - [section]: "multilingual LLM text embeddings notably outperform others in node classification tasks when applied to multilingual acoustic pre-training ASR transcripts."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of LLM embeddings or multilingual acoustic pre-training in related papers.
- **Break condition:** If the semantic generalization of the embeddings is insufficient to handle the specific types of noise introduced by ASR errors, or if the language pair is too distant for the embeddings to generalize effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Node classification on ASR transcripts generally achieves competitive results compared to human transcripts, despite relatively high WERs.
- **Mechanism:** The influence of text embeddings, which focus on the generalized semantic context of text segments, reduces the impact of ASR errors on prediction performance. This means that even with errors in the transcripts, the embeddings can still provide useful semantic information for classification.
- **Core assumption:** The text embeddings capture sufficient semantic information to mitigate the impact of ASR errors.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "node classification on ASR transcripts generally achieves competitive results compared to human transcripts, despite relatively high word error rates (WERs) of 28.8% and 29%."
  - [section]: "node classification on ASR transcripts generally achieved competitive results compared to human transcripts, despite relatively high WERs of 28.8% and 29%."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of ASR errors or their impact on node classification in related papers.
- **Break condition:** If the ASR errors introduce semantic distortions that the embeddings cannot compensate for, or if the errors are systematic and pervasive, leading to a degradation in the quality of the embeddings.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Link prediction on ASR transcripts generally outperforms that on human transcripts, despite relatively high WERs.
- **Mechanism:** The GCN model, when combined with multilingual embeddings, is particularly effective at predicting links in ASR transcripts. The GCN's ability to aggregate information from neighboring nodes allows it to compensate for errors in individual transcripts by leveraging the broader context of the graph.
- **Core assumption:** The GCN's message-passing mechanism can effectively aggregate information to overcome the noise introduced by ASR errors.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "link prediction on ASR transcripts generally outperforms that on human transcripts, despite relatively high word error rates (WERs) of 28.8% and 29%."
  - [section]: "link prediction on ASR transcripts generally outperformed that on human transcripts, despite relatively high WERs of 28.8% and 29%."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of link prediction performance on ASR transcripts in related papers.
- **Break condition:** If the errors in the ASR transcripts are too severe or systematic, leading to incorrect link predictions even with the GCN's aggregation mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - **Why needed here:** GNNs are used to learn and generalize patterns and relationships from the knowledge graph (KG) constructed from speech data. They enable node classification and link prediction tasks on the KG.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary function of GNNs in the wav2graph framework?

- **Concept:** Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
  - **Why needed here:** KGs provide a structured representation of entities and their relationships, which is essential for the wav2graph framework to process and analyze speech data.
  - **Quick check question:** How are KGs constructed from speech data in the wav2graph framework?

- **Concept:** Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
  - **Why needed here:** ASR is used to transcribe audio signals into text, which is a crucial step in constructing the KG from speech data.
  - **Quick check question:** What role does ASR play in the wav2graph framework, and how does it affect the quality of the KG?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ASR Models -> Named Entity Recognition (NER) -> KG Construction -> Node Embeddings -> GNN Models
- **Critical path:** 1. Transcribe audio using ASR models. 2. Extract named entities using NER. 3. Construct KG from utterances and named entities. 4. Generate node embeddings. 5. Train GNN models on the KG. 6. Perform node classification and link prediction tasks.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using pre-trained embeddings vs. random embeddings: Pre-trained embeddings generally perform better but may not be optimized for the specific domain.
  - Monolingual vs. multilingual acoustic pre-training: Multilingual pre-training can improve performance but may introduce additional complexity.
  - Different GNN architectures (SAGE, GCN, GAT, SuperGAT): Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific task and data characteristics.
- **Failure signatures:** Poor performance on node classification or link prediction tasks. High variance in model performance across different embeddings or GNN architectures. Inability to generalize to unseen data.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Compare the performance of different GNN architectures (SAGE, GCN, GAT, SuperGAT) on the KG constructed from human transcripts.
  2. Evaluate the impact of using pre-trained embeddings vs. random embeddings on node classification and link prediction tasks.
  3. Assess the performance of the framework on ASR transcripts with different WERs to understand the robustness of the model to ASR errors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What is the specific mechanism by which text embeddings, which primarily focus on the generalized context of text segments (semantics), reduce the impact of ASR errors on prediction performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper suggests that the influence of text embeddings, which primarily focus on the generalized context of text segments (semantics), reduces the impact of ASR errors on prediction performance.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper provides a hypothesis but does not delve into the specific mechanisms by which text embeddings mitigate the impact of ASR errors.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Detailed analysis of the semantic content of text embeddings and their correlation with ASR errors, potentially through ablation studies or semantic similarity analysis.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the performance of wav2graph compare to other state-of-the-art methods for constructing and training knowledge graphs from speech data?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper introduces wav2graph as the first framework for supervised learning of knowledge graphs from speech data, but does not provide a comparison to existing methods.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on introducing wav2graph and presenting its results, without benchmarking against other approaches.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments with other methods for constructing and training knowledge graphs from speech data, using the same datasets and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the performance of wav2graph vary with different levels of ASR error rates, and what is the threshold beyond which the performance significantly degrades?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper presents results for ASR error rates of 28.8% and 29%, but does not explore the performance at different error rates.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper only considers two specific ASR error rates, and does not investigate the relationship between error rate and performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments with varying levels of ASR error rates, potentially through controlled degradation of transcripts or using datasets with known error rates, to determine the threshold beyond which performance degrades significantly.

## Limitations

- Performance claims are based on experiments with specific datasets (VietMed and self-collected) and limited ASR systems, which may not generalize to all speech domains or languages.
- The relatively high WERs (28.8% and 29%) used in experiments may not represent typical ASR performance across different applications.
- The claim that multilingual LLM embeddings "significantly outperform" other approaches may be overstated given the experimental conditions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core methodology of constructing KGs from speech data and using GNNs for node classification and link prediction is well-established and technically sound.
- **Medium Confidence:** The comparative performance of different embedding approaches and GNN architectures is supported by experimental results, though the specific conditions (dataset characteristics, ASR quality) may limit generalizability.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that multilingual LLM embeddings "significantly outperform" other approaches may be overstated given the experimental conditions, and the specific mechanisms by which ASR errors are compensated for remain partially theoretical.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Test the framework on diverse speech datasets from different domains (medical, conversational, technical) to assess generalizability beyond the VietMed dataset.
2. **ASR Robustness Analysis:** Systematically evaluate model performance across a wider range of WERs (10%-40%) to better understand the relationship between ASR quality and KG learning performance.
3. **Embedding Dimensionality Study:** Conduct experiments comparing different embedding dimensionalities (e.g., 512, 1024, 2048) to determine if the performance gains from high-dimensional LLM embeddings are due to semantic quality or simply increased parameter space.
