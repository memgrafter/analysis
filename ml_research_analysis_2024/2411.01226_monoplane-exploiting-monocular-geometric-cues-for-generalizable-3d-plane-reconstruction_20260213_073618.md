core_contribution: MonoPlane is a generalizable 3D plane detection and reconstruction
  framework that exploits monocular geometric cues. Unlike previous methods requiring
  multiple images or RGB-D input, or learning-based approaches suffering from domain
  shift, MonoPlane combines the best of both worlds by leveraging large-scale pre-trained
  neural networks to obtain depth and surface normals from a single image, then incorporating
  these cues into a proximity-guided RANSAC framework.

# MonoPlane: Exploiting Monocular Geometric Cues for Generalizable 3D Plane Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01226
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Zero-shot generalizable 3D plane detection from single images using proximity-guided RANSAC

## Executive Summary
MonoPlane presents a novel approach for 3D plane reconstruction from single images by leveraging monocular geometric cues. The method combines depth and surface normal estimates from pre-trained neural networks with a proximity-guided RANSAC framework, achieving superior generalizability compared to both traditional multi-view approaches and learning-based methods. By exploiting effective 3D point proximity modeling through graph-based RANSAC and incorporating image-level multi-plane joint optimization, MonoPlane demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse environments.

## Method Summary
MonoPlane operates by first obtaining depth and surface normal estimates from a single RGB image using large-scale pre-trained neural networks. These monocular geometric cues are then integrated into a proximity-guided RANSAC framework, where effective 3D point proximity modeling via a graph structure guides plane fitting from potentially noisy monocular depth estimates. The method further refines results through image-level multi-plane joint optimization to improve consistency among detected plane instances. This hybrid approach combines the generalizability of traditional geometric methods with the robustness of learned feature extraction, enabling zero-shot performance on datasets not seen during training.

## Key Results
- Achieves VOI scores of 0.907 and 1.135 on NYUv2 and Matterport3D datasets respectively
- Demonstrates superior zero-shot generalizability compared to learning-based baselines
- Maintains performance across diverse indoor environments without dataset-specific training
- Can be extended to sparse-view reconstruction scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from its hybrid approach that leverages pre-trained networks for robust feature extraction while maintaining geometric rigor through RANSAC-based plane fitting. By using depth and normal estimates as inputs to a proximity-guided RANSAC framework, MonoPlane can handle the inherent noise in monocular depth estimation while still benefiting from the rich semantic information captured by deep networks. The graph-based proximity modeling ensures that geometrically coherent points are grouped together during plane fitting, while the joint optimization step enforces consistency across multiple plane hypotheses.

## Foundational Learning

**Depth Estimation from Single Images**: Why needed - Provides 3D structure from 2D input; Quick check - Compare estimated vs ground truth depth statistics

**Surface Normal Estimation**: Why needed - Captures local surface orientation for plane detection; Quick check - Verify normal consistency across neighboring pixels

**RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)**: Why needed - Robust fitting algorithm for models from noisy data; Quick check - Analyze inlier ratios for detected planes

**Graph-based Proximity Modeling**: Why needed - Groups geometrically coherent points for plane fitting; Quick check - Visualize point connectivity graphs

**Multi-plane Joint Optimization**: Why needed - Ensures consistency across multiple plane hypotheses; Quick check - Measure improvement in plane overlap after optimization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pre-trained CNN -> Depth & Normal Extraction -> Graph Construction -> Proximity-guided RANSAC -> Joint Optimization -> Final Plane Hypotheses

**Critical Path**: The most performance-critical path is Pre-trained CNN -> Depth & Normal Extraction -> Proximity-guided RANSAC, as errors in depth/normal estimation propagate through the RANSAC pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Relies on pre-trained models (good generalizability) vs end-to-end training (potentially better performance but less generalizable)
- Graph-based proximity modeling adds computational overhead but improves robustness
- Joint optimization improves consistency but requires additional computation

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor depth/normal estimates leading to incorrect plane hypotheses
- Graph construction failures causing fragmented plane detection
- Optimization convergence issues resulting in suboptimal plane configurations

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate depth and normal estimation quality on validation set
2. Test RANSAC plane fitting with ground truth depth vs estimated depth
3. Measure impact of graph proximity modeling by comparing with standard RANSAC

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the limitations section suggests areas for future investigation including performance on outdoor environments, handling of scenes with many small planar regions, and robustness to extreme lighting conditions.

## Limitations
- Performance may degrade with extreme lighting conditions and highly reflective surfaces
- Reliance on pre-trained models introduces potential domain gaps for novel materials
- Evaluation focused primarily on indoor scenes, with unclear performance on outdoor environments
- Multi-plane joint optimization may struggle with scenes containing many small or complexly oriented planes

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Technical approach and RANSAC integration are well-founded and effectively implemented

**Medium confidence**: Generalizability claims across diverse environments, as evaluation is primarily limited to indoor datasets

**Medium confidence**: Scalability to scenes with many small planar regions, as the method may struggle with increased complexity

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance on outdoor datasets and scenes with mixed indoor-outdoor content to assess true generalizability
2. Test robustness across extreme lighting conditions and highly reflective/transparent surfaces
3. Analyze performance scaling with scene complexity by evaluating on scenes with 50+ planar regions
