# IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.01266
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01266
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Multimodal models perform substantially better on textual representations than visual ones, with proposed prompting techniques improving performance by up to 10 percentage points

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IsoBench, a benchmark dataset to evaluate multimodal foundation models across four domains: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each problem in IsoBench is provided with multiple isomorphic representations, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. The key finding is that multimodal models perform substantially better on textual representations than visual ones—for example, Claude-3 Opus is 28.7 points worse with images versus text. To bridge this performance gap, the authors propose two prompting techniques: IsoCombination, which combines multiple representations, and IsoScratchPad, which translates visual inputs into text. These methods improve model performance by up to 10 percentage points on certain tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors created IsoBench, a benchmark with 550 problems across four domains (math, science, algorithms, games), each provided in multiple isomorphic representations (text, image, LaTeX, etc.). They evaluated several multimodal models (GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, Claude-3 Opus, Llama-3-V) on these problems using different input representations. Two prompting techniques were developed: IsoCombination concatenates multiple representations to leverage all information sources, while IsoScratchPad translates visual inputs into text first, then solves using the stronger text pathway. The benchmark reveals consistent performance gaps favoring text over images, which the proposed techniques help to mitigate.

## Key Results
- Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text on the same problems
- IsoCombination improves model performance on graph algorithm problems by up to 9.4 points compared with the best single representation
- Multimodal models show a consistent preference for textual representations across various foundation models and problem types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal models exhibit modality-specific performance gaps due to suboptimal fusion of visual features
- Mechanism: Vision-language models tokenize images into coarse embeddings that lose fine-grained details needed for tasks like function plotting or breakpoint counting, while text inputs are processed directly by the LLM backbone with high precision
- Core assumption: The image tokenization process used in multimodal models (e.g., ViT-based encoders) produces feature representations that are insufficient for detailed visual reasoning tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations... Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text"
  - [section] "we observe generated responses of vision-language prompts to be cursory compared to those of language-only prompts; and they sometimes contain a direct answer instead of a reasoning process"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of tokenization granularity in cited papers
- Break condition: If a multimodal model uses a vision encoder that preserves fine-grained visual features (e.g., high-resolution patch embeddings or explicit curve detection modules), the performance gap should diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models default to language-only reasoning shortcuts when visual inputs are present, bypassing genuine multimodal integration
- Mechanism: When given both image and text inputs, the model often ignores the visual modality and relies on the text alone, especially when the text contains sufficient information to answer the question
- Core assumption: The multimodal fusion architecture does not enforce strict dependence on visual features for tasks where text is also available
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations"
  - [section] "recent works have reported language models to prefer textual formats that are more common in the pre-training data"
  - [corpus] Weak - related work focuses on alignment methods, not shortcut behavior
- Break condition: If the model architecture penalizes or constrains reliance on language-only reasoning paths when visual inputs are present, the performance gap should reduce.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad methods improve performance by explicitly leveraging multiple isomorphic representations
- Mechanism: IsoCombination concatenates multiple representations into a single prompt, forcing the model to consider all information sources; IsoScratchPad translates visual input into text first, then solves using the stronger text pathway
- Core assumption: Multimodal models can effectively integrate information from multiple isomorphic representations when prompted appropriately
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we present two prompting techniques, IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations"
  - [section] "we find that both methods improve aspects of multimodal models, with IsoCB improving model performance on graph algorithm problems by up to 9.4 points compared with the best single representation"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of these specific techniques in related work
- Break condition: If the model's context window is too small to handle combined representations effectively, or if the translation step in IsoScratchPad introduces errors, performance gains may not materialize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Isomorphic representations**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that different input formats (image, text, math) can encode the same underlying information is crucial for interpreting the benchmark results and the proposed solutions
  - Quick check question: If a function f(x) is plotted as an image and also written as LaTeX code, are these two representations isomorphic? Why or why not?

- Concept: **Multimodal fusion architectures**
  - Why needed here: Knowing how vision and language features are combined (early vs late fusion, tokenization methods) explains why certain tasks perform better with text
  - Quick check question: In a transformer-based multimodal model, at what stage are visual features typically integrated with language features?

- Concept: **Chain-of-thought reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The paper observes that visual prompts often produce cursory answers without reasoning, while text prompts generate detailed explanations
  - Quick check question: How might you modify a prompt to encourage a multimodal model to show its reasoning process when given an image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Vision encoder (e.g., ViT, CNN) → Image tokenization → Multimodal fusion layer → LLM backbone → Output
  - Text encoder → Language embeddings → Multimodal fusion layer → LLM backbone → Output
  - IsoCombination: Concatenate multiple encoded representations before fusion
  - IsoScratchPad: Visual → Text translation module → Text encoder pathway

- Critical path:
  1. Input preprocessing (image tokenization or text encoding)
  2. Feature extraction (vision or language)
  3. Multimodal fusion (cross-attention or concatenation)
  4. Reasoning/decision making (LLM inference)
  5. Output generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-grained vs coarse visual features: More detail improves visual task performance but increases computational cost
  - Early vs late fusion: Early fusion allows tighter integration but may lose modality-specific nuances
  - Single vs multiple representations: Multiple representations improve accuracy but require larger context windows

- Failure signatures:
  - Visual tasks: Counting errors, inability to detect fine details, cursory reasoning
  - Text tasks: Generally strong performance, detailed explanations
  - Combined tasks: Model may ignore visual input, rely on text shortcut

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run IsoBench with a single visual representation vs single text representation to establish baseline performance gap
  2. Test IsoCombination on tasks where text alone is insufficient (e.g., counting breakpoints in plots)
  3. Implement and evaluate IsoScratchPad on science questions with complex figures to assess translation accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do specific architectural choices in multimodal models (like image tokenization methods) impact their performance on tasks requiring detailed visual analysis?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that current multimodal models struggle with tasks like convexity problems and breakpoint counting, suggesting limitations in how visual features are processed and represented
- Why unresolved: The paper does not delve into the specific mechanisms by which different architectural choices affect model performance on these tasks. It identifies a performance gap but does not explore the underlying causes related to model design
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating different architectural approaches (e.g., early vs. late fusion, different image tokenization methods) on the IsoBench tasks would provide insights into which design choices lead to better performance on detailed visual analysis tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can training multimodal models on more balanced datasets with diverse visual representations improve their performance on tasks where they currently underperform compared to text-only models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that multimodal models perform substantially better on text-only prompts than image-based prompts, in contrast with known human preferences for images over text. It suggests that the imbalance between visual and input data might contribute to this discrepancy
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the impact of training data composition on model performance. It raises the possibility of data imbalance as a factor but does not empirically test this hypothesis
- What evidence would resolve it: Training multimodal models on datasets with more balanced visual and textual representations, and then evaluating their performance on IsoBench, would reveal whether training data diversity improves their ability to handle visual inputs effectively

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different prompting strategies, beyond IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad, affect the performance of multimodal models on tasks with isomorphic representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad as methods to improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations. It finds that these methods improve performance in certain settings
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents two prompting techniques, it does not explore the full space of possible prompting strategies or compare their effectiveness. It leaves open the question of whether other approaches might yield even better results
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation with a variety of prompting strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, different ways of combining representations, using intermediate reasoning steps) on the IsoBench tasks would identify which approaches are most effective for improving multimodal model performance

## Limitations
- The performance gap may be partially attributed to domain-specific dataset biases rather than fundamental architectural limitations
- The benchmark focuses on STEM domains where text representations are naturally more precise, potentially inflating the observed modality preference
- The proposed solutions rely on prompting techniques rather than architectural modifications, which may have limited generalizability

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The existence of a consistent performance gap favoring text over images across multiple multimodal models
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism that visual tokenization loses fine-grained details needed for precise reasoning tasks
- **Low confidence**: The specific effectiveness of IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad methods across all problem types

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Apply IsoBench methodology to non-STEM domains (e.g., natural scenes, everyday objects) to determine if the visual-text performance gap persists outside structured mathematical and scientific contexts

2. **Feature analysis experiment**: Quantitatively measure the information loss in visual tokenization by comparing feature embeddings from the vision encoder against ground truth visual features for tasks like counting and precise measurement

3. **Architectural ablation study**: Implement the IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad approaches in different multimodal model architectures (e.g., test-time adaptation vs. fine-tuning) to isolate whether improvements stem from prompting strategy or from forcing better multimodal fusion
