# A Study of Dropout-Induced Modality Bias on Robustness to Missing Video Frames for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04245
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04245
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed MDA-KD and MS-Adapter achieve state-of-the-art CER on MISP2021/2022 while maintaining robustness to video missing

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates why dropout improves AVSR robustness to missing video but hurts performance on complete data, revealing that dropout induces excessive audio modality bias in the latent representation space. The authors propose Multimodal Distribution Approximation with Knowledge Distillation (MDA-KD) to prevent the student model from shifting towards a unimodal audio distribution, and Modality-Specific Adapters (MS-Adapter) to dynamically switch decision strategy for fully missing video. Evaluated on MISP2021 and MISP2022, their approach achieves state-of-the-art CER while maintaining robustness to video missing, outperforming dropout-only baselines.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a teacher model on complete multimodal data using a Conformer architecture, then training a student model with dropout applied to video frames and knowledge distillation loss. The MDA-KD framework uses the teacher as an anchor to constrain the student's distribution, minimizing distance between their decision distribution samples. MS-Adapters are integrated on the audio branch to handle entirely missing video during inference by dynamically switching the decision pattern.

## Key Results
- MDA-KD prevents excessive audio modality bias induced by dropout
- MS-Adapters effectively handle completely missing video frames
- Achieves state-of-the-art CER on MISP2021 and MISP2022 datasets
- Maintains robustness to video missing while preserving performance on complete data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Dropout on video frames induces a shift in the latent representation space from a multimodal distribution toward a unimodal audio-dominant distribution. The model relies more heavily on audio modality to maintain performance, shifting the decision-making distribution. The core assumption is that the model treats dropout-augmented training data as the new distribution and adapts its latent representation accordingly.

### Mechanism 2
The Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) systematically describes the relationship between modality bias and robustness to missing modalities. The MBH uses the Modality Bias Venn Diagram (MBVD) to represent latent decision features as modality-general and modality-specific components. Dropout affects the proportions of these components, leading to a bias towards the audio modality. The core assumption is that the MBVD accurately represents the latent decision-making process in multimodal systems.

### Mechanism 3
The MDA-KD framework prevents the student model from shifting towards a unimodal audio distribution by using a teacher model trained on complete data as an anchor. It minimizes the distance between decision distribution samples of teacher and student models. The core assumption is that the teacher model's distribution represents an ideal multimodal decision strategy that the student model should approximate.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Modality Bias in Multimodal Systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding modality bias is crucial to analyzing the effects of dropout on audio-visual speech recognition systems
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between modality-balanced and modality-biased systems?

- Concept: Knowledge Distillation
  - Why needed here: MDA-KD uses knowledge distillation to prevent the student model from shifting towards a unimodal distribution
  - Quick check question: How does knowledge distillation help in constraining the student model's distribution?

- Concept: Latent Representation Space
  - Why needed here: The mechanisms involve analyzing and manipulating the latent representation space to achieve robustness to missing video frames
  - Quick check question: What is the significance of the latent representation space in multimodal systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio and visual encoders -> Dual cross-attention module -> MS-Adapters -> Knowledge distillation module
- Critical path: Audio and visual inputs are processed through their respective encoders, the dual cross-attention module fuses the modalities, the MS-Adapters dynamically switch the decision pattern based on the presence of video frames, and the knowledge distillation module constrains the student model's distribution using the teacher model
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the proportions of modality-general and modality-specific components in the latent representation space, choosing the appropriate dropout rate to achieve robustness without excessive modality bias, deciding the rank and quantity of MS-Adapters for optimal performance
- Failure signatures: Over-reliance on the audio modality, neglecting visual cues; insufficient robustness to missing video frames; performance degradation on complete multimodal input
- First 3 experiments: 1) Analyze the effect of different dropout rates on the latent representation space and modality bias, 2) Evaluate the performance of the MDA-KD framework in preventing the student model from shifting towards a unimodal distribution, 3) Assess the effectiveness of the MS-Adapters in dynamically switching the decision pattern for completely missing video frames

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the dropout-induced modality bias vary across different types of multimodal tasks beyond A-VSR, such as emotion recognition or speech enhancement? The study primarily focuses on A-VSR and briefly mentions other applications. A comprehensive analysis across different tasks is needed to understand the generalizability of the findings.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of the dropout rate on the effectiveness of the Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) in preventing performance degradation in multimodal systems? The study uses a fixed dropout rate in experiments. Varying dropout rates could provide insights into the optimal conditions for MBH to prevent performance degradation.

### Open Question 3
How do the proposed Modality-Specific Adapters (MS-Adapters) perform in scenarios with multiple missing modalities simultaneously? The paper introduces MS-Adapters to handle severe or complete video missing but does not explore scenarios with multiple missing modalities.

## Limitations
- The Modality Bias Hypothesis and Modality Bias Venn Diagram remain theoretical constructs without direct experimental confirmation
- The exact contribution of each MDA-KD component to the final performance is not isolated through ablation studies
- Limited evaluation to AVSR task and two specific datasets (MISP2021/2022)

## Confidence
- **High**: The empirical results showing improved CER on both complete and missing video data compared to dropout-only baselines
- **Medium**: The dropout-induced modality bias mechanism and its relationship to robustness-accuracy tradeoff
- **Low**: The theoretical foundations (MBH/MBVD) and the precise mechanism by which MDA-KD constrains the student distribution

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study of MDA-KD components to isolate the contribution of teacher anchoring, latent space matching, and KL divergence terms
2. Use visualization techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to empirically verify the proposed multimodal-to-unimodal distribution shift under dropout and its mitigation by MDA-KD
3. Test the proposed approach on datasets with different characteristics (e.g., cleaner speech, controlled environments) to assess generalizability beyond the MISP datasets
