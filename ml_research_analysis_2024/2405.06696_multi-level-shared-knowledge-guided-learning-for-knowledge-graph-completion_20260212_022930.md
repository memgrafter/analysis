# Multi-level Shared Knowledge Guided Learning for Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06696
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: SKG-KGC achieves 72.2% MRR and 67.0% Hit@1 on WN18RR, outperforming existing text-based methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-level Shared Knowledge Guided learning method (SKG) for knowledge graph completion (KGC) that addresses shared knowledge within KGC datasets and subtasks. The method operates at both dataset and task levels, using dataset-level knowledge to broaden the original dataset and task-level knowledge sharing through a novel multi-task learning architecture. SKG-KGC demonstrates significant improvements over existing text-based methods on three benchmark datasets, with the most notable improvement on WN18RR where MRR increases from 66.6% to 72.2% and Hit@1 from 58.7% to 67.0%.

## Method Summary
SKG-KGC addresses shared knowledge in KGC through a two-level approach. At the dataset level, it uses TextRank to extract key sentences from entity descriptions and creates entity sets with shared features, then expands the original dataset by incorporating these entity sets into triples. At the task level, it employs a bi-encoder architecture with two BERT-base encoders to handle different subtasks (head prediction, relation prediction, tail prediction) simultaneously through balanced multi-task learning. The model uses focal loss to dynamically allocate weights to different subtasks, ensuring each receives appropriate attention during training.

## Key Results
- SKG-KGC achieves 72.2% MRR and 67.0% Hit@1 on WN18RR (vs. 66.6% MRR, 58.7% Hit@1 for existing methods)
- Significant improvements on FB15k-237 and Wikidata5M datasets as well
- Performance gains are attributed to both dataset expansion and balanced multi-task learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that shared knowledge exists at both dataset and task levels in KGC. Dataset-level sharing occurs when multiple entities share common features or descriptions, while task-level sharing happens among the three subtasks (head prediction, relation prediction, tail prediction) that constitute KGC. By extracting and leveraging this shared knowledge through dataset expansion and multi-task learning, SKG-KGC can better capture relationships between entities and improve overall completion performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC)**: The task of predicting missing entities in triples (h, r, t). Needed to understand the problem being solved. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between head, relation, and tail prediction subtasks?
- **TextRank**: A graph-based ranking model for text processing. Used to extract key sentences from entity descriptions. Quick check: Do you understand how TextRank differs from other summarization methods like TF-IDF?
- **Multi-task Learning**: A learning paradigm where multiple related tasks are learned simultaneously. Applied here to handle KGC's three subtasks. Quick check: Can you identify situations where multi-task learning might hurt performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
BERT encoders -> TextRank-based dataset expansion -> Balanced multi-task learning with focal loss -> KGC predictions

**Critical Path:**
TextRank extraction → Dataset expansion → Multi-task training → Evaluation on KGC metrics

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- TextRank vs. more sophisticated NLP models for sentence extraction
- Multi-task learning vs. separate training for each KGC subtask
- Dataset expansion vs. potential noise introduction

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on datasets with limited textual descriptions
- Degraded results when task-level knowledge sharing is incorrectly balanced
- Ineffective dataset expansion when TextRank fails to capture relevant sentences

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Implement TextRank-based dataset expansion and verify the number of expanded entities matches expected values
2. Train SKG-KGC on a small subset of WN18RR to validate the bi-encoder architecture
3. Test the focal loss-based weight allocation by varying focusing parameters and measuring impact on each KGC subtask

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the SKG-KGC model's performance scale with increasingly large knowledge graph datasets beyond Wikidata5M? The paper mentions that the model performs well on Wikidata5M but notes that training time increases significantly with larger datasets, suggesting potential scalability limitations. This remains unresolved as the paper only tests on three datasets, with no exploration of how the model would perform on even larger, more diverse datasets.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between dataset-level shared knowledge extraction and task-level multi-task learning for different types of knowledge graphs? The paper states "the effectiveness of common knowledge within entity sets sharing the same (h, r) or (r, t)" and discusses the dynamic and balanced loss weight scheme, but doesn't explore how these should be weighted differently for various knowledge graph structures. This is unresolved because the current model uses a fixed approach for both dataset and task-level knowledge sharing.

### Open Question 3
How does the SKG-KGC model handle truly novel entities and relations that have no textual description or are completely out-of-domain? The paper mentions "inductive reasoning for some unseen entities or relations" but only demonstrates this capability on Wikidata5M with entities that have Wikipedia pages. This remains unresolved as the model relies heavily on textual descriptions for entity and relation embeddings, and the paper doesn't address scenarios where entities/relations have no textual information.

## Limitations
- The negative sampling strategy is not fully specified, only noted to follow SimKGC's approach
- The focal loss-based weight allocation lacks complete implementation details, particularly regarding focusing parameter values
- TextRank-based dataset expansion methodology lacks specifics on sentence scoring thresholds and entity selection criteria

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of using dataset-level expansion with TextRank summarization and task-level knowledge sharing through balanced multi-task learning is well-described and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** The reported performance improvements are substantial and consistently observed across all datasets, though the exact contribution of each component (dataset expansion vs. task-level sharing) is not isolated through ablation studies.

**Medium Confidence:** The choice of hyper-parameters and training procedures follows established patterns in KGC literature, making the results plausible and verifiable.

## Next Checks

1. Implement and verify the TextRank-based dataset expansion process by comparing the number and content of expanded entities against the paper's claims for each benchmark dataset.

2. Conduct an ablation study to isolate the contribution of dataset-level expansion versus task-level knowledge sharing to the overall performance gains.

3. Test the sensitivity of the balanced multi-task learning component by varying the focal loss focusing parameters and measuring their impact on different KGC subtasks.
