# A Safe Harbor for AI Evaluation and Red Teaming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04893
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Leading AI companies' terms of service restrict good faith safety research by prohibiting adversarial testing and threatening account suspension or legal action. This creates chilling effects on important vulnerability research. The authors propose two protections: a legal safe harbor (protecting researchers from civil liability if they follow vulnerability disclosure practices) and a technical safe harbor (protecting researcher accounts from suspension when following proper protocols). These voluntary commitments would enable more independent AI safety research while maintaining protections against malicious use.

## Executive Summary
Leading AI companies' terms of service and enforcement mechanisms create significant barriers to independent safety research through account suspensions, legal threats, and restrictive policies. The paper identifies how these practices chill important vulnerability research that could improve AI safety. The authors propose a dual safe harbor framework - legal protections against civil liability and technical protections against account suspensions - that would enable broader participation in AI safety evaluations while maintaining appropriate guardrails against malicious use.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze current AI company terms of service and enforcement mechanisms across major platforms to identify barriers to safety research. They propose a two-pronged approach: (1) A legal safe harbor protecting researchers from civil liability when conducting good faith research according to established vulnerability disclosure practices, and (2) A technical safe harbor protecting researcher accounts from suspension when following proper protocols. The framework includes delegation to trusted third parties for researcher vetting and an appeals process for disputed actions.

## Key Results
- AI companies' terms of service prohibit adversarial testing and threaten legal action against safety researchers
- Current practices create chilling effects that deter important vulnerability research
- Safe harbor protections would enable broader, more inclusive community participation in AI safety research
- Delegation to trusted third parties can scale researcher access while maintaining quality standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Legal safe harbor reduces chilling effects on good-faith research
- Mechanism: By clarifying that certain research activities are legally protected when conducted according to vulnerability disclosure practices, researchers can conduct safety evaluations without fear of civil liability
- Core assumption: Companies will honor their commitment to provide legal safe harbor and courts will recognize these commitments as valid legal protections
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose that major AI developers commit to providing a legal and technical safe harbor, indemnifying public interest safety research and protecting it from the threat of account suspensions or legal reprisal"
  - [section 4.1] "A legal safe harbor could mitigate risks from civil litigation, providing assurances that AI platforms will not sue researchers if their actions were taken for research purposes"
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average neighbor FMR=0.472, showing moderate relatedness to the topic
- Break condition: Companies fail to honor their commitments or courts rule that these safe harbors do not provide actual legal protection

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Technical safe harbor enables broader participation by protecting researcher accounts
- Mechanism: By guaranteeing that accounts engaged in good faith research won't be suspended, researchers can freely conduct evaluations without losing access to critical tools
- Core assumption: Companies can effectively distinguish between malicious and legitimate research activities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "companies should provide a technical safe harbor, protecting safety researchers from having their accounts subject to moderation or suspension"
  - [section 4.2] "Legal safe harbors still do not prevent account suspensions or other enforcement action that would impede independent safety and trustworthiness evaluations"
  - [section 4.2] "We propose companies offer some path to eliminate these technical barriers for good faith research"
- Break condition: Companies cannot reliably distinguish between malicious and legitimate research, leading to either allowing harmful activity or blocking legitimate research

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Delegation to trusted third parties scales participation without compromising quality
- Mechanism: By having independent organizations like universities or NAIRR handle researcher access decisions, companies can support more research while avoiding conflicts of interest
- Core assumption: Trusted third parties can effectively evaluate research proposals and maintain appropriate standards
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "we propose the responsibility of access authorization be delegated to trusted third parties, such as universities, government, or civil society organizations"
  - [section 4.2] "The U.S. National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) offers a suitable vehicle for a pilot of this approach"
  - [section 4.2] "This solution scales, with partner organizations likely to aid in access review in exchange for wider participation in AI red teaming"
- Break condition: Trusted third parties lack resources or expertise to properly evaluate research proposals, or companies selectively choose partners that align with their interests

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vulnerability disclosure policies
  - Why needed here: The safe harbor proposals are built on the foundation of established security practices, specifically vulnerability disclosure policies
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a typical vulnerability disclosure policy that would be relevant to AI safety research?

- Concept: Chilling effects in research
  - Why needed here: Understanding how fear of legal consequences or account suspension discourages important safety research is central to the paper's motivation
  - Quick check question: How do chilling effects differ from direct legal prohibitions in their impact on research behavior?

- Concept: Good faith research standards
  - Why needed here: The safe harbor protections only apply to research conducted in good faith, making it critical to understand what constitutes good faith research
  - Quick check question: What criteria distinguish good faith safety research from malicious attempts to bypass AI safeguards?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Legal framework (CFAA, DMCA, terms of service) -> Technical infrastructure (API access, account management) -> Governance structure (trusted third parties, appeals processes) -> Research ecosystem (academic institutions, civil society organizations)

- Critical path:
  1. Company commits to safe harbor provisions
  2. Trusted third party establishes researcher vetting process
  3. Researchers register their work and obtain protected status
  4. Researchers conduct safety evaluations within defined boundaries
  5. Vulnerabilities are disclosed according to established timelines
  6. Appeals process handles any disputed account actions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Broader access vs. risk of misuse
  - Independence vs. accountability
  - Standardization vs. flexibility for different research contexts
  - Transparency vs. protection of sensitive information

- Failure signatures:
  - Companies selectively enforce safe harbor provisions
  - Trusted third parties become bottlenecks or rubber stamps
  - Researchers abuse protected status for non-research purposes
  - Companies use safe harbor as marketing without substantive change

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement safe harbor with single company and NAIRR as trusted partner, tracking researcher participation and any account issues
  2. Compare research output and diversity between protected and non-protected researchers over 6-month period
  3. Conduct simulated appeal scenarios to test the effectiveness and fairness of the appeals process

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific legal protections could be offered to researchers conducting safety evaluations on generative AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a legal safe harbor to protect researchers from civil liability.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests the need for legal protections but does not specify the exact legal mechanisms or protections that could be implemented.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of potential legal frameworks, such as amendments to existing laws or the creation of new legislation, that would specifically protect researchers conducting safety evaluations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can companies ensure that the technical safe harbor does not lead to an increase in malicious use of AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges the potential risk of malicious use but does not provide a detailed strategy to mitigate this risk.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests the need for a technical safe harbor but does not address how to balance the protection of good faith researchers with the prevention of malicious use.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study or proposal outlining specific measures, such as enhanced monitoring or stricter access controls, that companies could implement to prevent malicious use while maintaining a technical safe harbor.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What criteria should be used to determine whether research conducted on AI systems is in "good faith"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for a determination of "good faith" but does not specify the criteria for such a determination.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests the importance of "good faith" research but does not provide a clear definition or set of criteria for evaluating whether research meets this standard.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed framework or set of guidelines that outline the specific criteria and processes for evaluating whether research on AI systems is conducted in good faith.

## Limitations
- Companies may interpret "good faith" research criteria too narrowly, excluding important safety research categories
- The effectiveness of trusted third parties in scaling access while maintaining quality standards remains untested at scale
- Legal safe harbor's enforceability depends on court interpretations of voluntary commitments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The identification of current barriers (account suspensions, legal threats) to AI safety research is well-documented and empirically supported
- **Medium Confidence:** The proposed mechanisms would reduce chilling effects, assuming companies fully commit to their stated safe harbor provisions
- **Low Confidence:** The delegation to trusted third parties will effectively scale participation without creating new barriers or biases

## Next Checks
1. **Legal Precedent Analysis:** Review existing vulnerability disclosure case law to assess the likelihood that courts would recognize voluntary safe harbor commitments as enforceable protections
2. **Stakeholder Simulation:** Conduct structured interviews with AI company legal teams to understand their interpretation of "good faith" criteria and potential limitations
3. **Pilot Implementation Metrics:** Track researcher participation rates, account suspension incidents, and appeal outcomes in a small-scale safe harbor implementation before broader rollout
