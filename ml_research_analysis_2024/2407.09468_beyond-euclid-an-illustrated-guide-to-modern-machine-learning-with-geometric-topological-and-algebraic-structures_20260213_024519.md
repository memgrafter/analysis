## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09468
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09468
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Synthesizes non-Euclidean ML field with unified framework categorizing data and models by geometric, topological, and algebraic structures

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive review synthesizes the rapidly growing field of non-Euclidean machine learning, which generalizes classical ML methods to data with rich geometric, topological, and algebraic structures beyond Euclidean space. The paper introduces a unified framework that categorizes data types (as coordinates or signals over various spaces) and ML models based on the mathematical structures of both input/output spaces and the algorithms themselves. Through systematic surveying across regression, latent embedding methods, deep learning architectures, and attention mechanisms, the review highlights key innovations like manifold-aware layers, equivariant networks, and topological neural networks while revealing current challenges and future research opportunities.

## Method Summary
This review paper employs a comprehensive literature survey methodology organized around a unified mathematical structure taxonomy. The authors systematically categorize non-Euclidean machine learning methods based on geometric, topological, and algebraic structures present in both data (input/output spaces) and model architectures. The approach involves creating comprehensive tables enumerating all possible configurations of mathematical structures, which reveals gaps in the literature and provides actionable guidance for practitioners. The review covers classical methods like manifold-valued regression and PCA, modern deep learning approaches including manifold-valued neural networks and equivariant networks, and emerging areas like topological and simplicial neural networks. Software libraries and benchmarks are organized according to the mathematical structures they support, facilitating practical implementation guidance.

## Key Results
- Introduces a unified taxonomy organizing non-Euclidean ML methods by mathematical structure of data and models
- Identifies systematic gaps in the literature through comprehensive survey across all structure combinations
- Provides actionable guidance for practitioners through organized software libraries and benchmarks
- Highlights current challenges including lack of standardized benchmarks and parameter reporting
- Outlines future research opportunities particularly in non-Euclidean dynamical systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The paper unifies disparate non-Euclidean ML methods by categorizing them according to the mathematical structure of both data and model. By providing a taxonomy that explicitly distinguishes between Euclidean, manifold, topological, and algebraic structures in both input/output spaces and model architecture, the paper clarifies relationships and enables systematic comparison across methods. The core assumption is that mathematical structure (geometry, topology, algebra) is the most natural organizing principle for non-Euclidean ML methods.

### Mechanism 2
The paper identifies gaps in the non-Euclidean ML literature by systematically surveying methods across all possible combinations of data and model structures. By creating comprehensive tables that enumerate all possible configurations of geometric, topological, and algebraic structures, the paper reveals which combinations have been explored and which remain open research areas. The core assumption is that a complete survey across all mathematical structure combinations will reveal systematic gaps in the literature.

### Mechanism 3
The paper provides actionable guidance for practitioners by organizing software libraries and benchmarks according to the mathematical structures they support. By categorizing software libraries and benchmarks based on their mathematical structure capabilities, the paper helps practitioners select appropriate tools for their specific non-Euclidean ML problems. The core assumption is that practitioners need guidance on selecting appropriate tools based on mathematical structure compatibility rather than just general ML task compatibility.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Riemannian manifolds and geodesic distance
  - **Why needed here**: Many non-Euclidean ML methods operate on manifolds where standard Euclidean operations don't apply. Understanding manifolds and geodesics is essential for implementing methods like geodesic regression and manifold-valued neural networks.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why the Euclidean mean of points on a sphere doesn't lie on the sphere itself?

- **Concept**: Group actions and equivariance
  - **Why needed here**: Equivariant networks are a major class of non-Euclidean ML methods that leverage symmetry through group actions. Understanding how groups act on spaces and how to build equivariant layers is crucial for implementing these methods.
  - **Quick check question**: What does it mean for a neural network layer to be equivariant to a group action?

- **Concept**: Topological spaces and simplicial complexes
  - **Why needed here**: Graph neural networks, hypergraph neural networks, and simplicial neural networks all operate on topological structures. Understanding basic topology and how to represent relationships using simplicial complexes is essential for these methods.
  - **Quick check question**: How does a simplicial complex generalize the concept of a graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Mathematical structure taxonomy -> Survey methodology -> Software and benchmark organization -> Application domain analysis
- **Critical path**: Start with understanding the mathematical structure taxonomy, then apply it to survey methods, organize software/libraries, and finally analyze applications and opportunities
- **Design tradeoffs**: The taxonomy approach provides systematic organization but may miss methods that don't fit neatly into the mathematical structure framework. The comprehensive survey approach ensures coverage but requires significant effort to maintain as the field evolves.
- **Failure signatures**: If methods cannot be categorized using the mathematical structure framework, or if practitioners find the framework too abstract for practical implementation, the approach may need revision.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement a simple geodesic regression method on a manifold (e.g., sphere) to understand how non-Euclidean geometry affects regression.
  2. Build a basic equivariant layer for a simple group (e.g., rotations in 2D) to understand group actions and equivariance.
  3. Create a simple graph neural network and then extend it to a simplicial neural network to understand topological structures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we develop more efficient non-Euclidean dynamical systems models that capture geometric constraints in latent variable evolution? The paper highlights "Non-Euclidean dynamical systems" as an open area, noting that while current models often assume linear (Euclidean) dynamics, manifold-valued dynamics can capture richer constraints like symmetry, curvature, and conservation laws. Most existing models assume linear dynamics in latent spaces, and there is limited work on incorporating geometric structures into the evolution of latent variables over time, despite the potential for better generalization under limited data.

### Open Question 2
What are the most effective ways to benchmark and compare non-Euclidean machine learning models across different geometric, topological, and algebraic structures? The paper notes that "it is rare that two different models have been benchmarked on the same dataset" and that "parameter and data efficiency are frequently cited as advantages of building structure into neural network models," but few papers report parameter counts or computational cost. The diversity of tasks, datasets, and non-Euclidean structures used in the literature makes it difficult to compare models fairly, and there is a lack of standardized benchmarks and reporting of key metrics like parameter efficiency.

### Open Question 3
How can we develop non-Euclidean attention mechanisms that effectively leverage geometric, topological, and algebraic structures in both the attention coefficients and the attention layers? The paper dedicates a section to "Neural Network Layers with Attention," reviewing how non-Euclidean structures can enrich attention mechanisms, but notes that this is an increasingly dominant paradigm with unique mathematical properties. While some progress has been made in incorporating geometric structures into attention mechanisms, there is limited work on leveraging topological and algebraic structures, and the optimal ways to do so remain unclear.

## Limitations

- The unified mathematical structure framework may oversimplify complex methodological differences that don't align neatly with geometric/topological/algebraic categories
- Limited empirical validation of whether the taxonomy improves practical model selection or research direction decisions
- Potential bias toward well-represented mathematical structures in the literature while underrepresenting emerging paradigms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The survey comprehensively covers existing non-Euclidean ML methods and identifies clear gaps in the literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The mathematical structure taxonomy provides a useful organizing principle, though its practical utility requires further validation
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that this framework represents the "most natural" organizing principle for the field

## Next Checks

1. Test the taxonomy's utility by having practitioners apply it to select appropriate methods for specific non-Euclidean ML problems and compare outcomes with alternative selection approaches
2. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking how well the identified gaps align with subsequent research developments in the field
3. Perform a structured evaluation comparing the mathematical structure framework against alternative organizing principles (e.g., computational complexity, application domain) for method selection
