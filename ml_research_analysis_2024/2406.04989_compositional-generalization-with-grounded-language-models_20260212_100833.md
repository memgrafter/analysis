# Compositional Generalization with Grounded Language Models

- Models struggle with compositional generalization when complexity increases in grounded language tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates compositional generalization in grounded language models using question answering over synthetic knowledge graphs. The authors develop a data generation procedure targeting substitutivity, productivity, and systematicity in compositionality. They evaluate multiple model architectures combining language models with graph neural networks on datasets with 2-, 3-, and 4-hop questions. Results show that models struggle with generalization to longer sequences and novel combinations of seen base components, with performance dropping significantly as complexity increases.

## Method Summary
The authors created synthetic knowledge graphs and generated question-answering datasets targeting specific compositional properties. They evaluated multiple model architectures that combine language models with graph neural networks on these datasets, testing 2-, 3-, and 4-hop questions to examine how performance scales with complexity. The evaluation focused on three compositional properties: substitutivity (replacing components while maintaining meaning), productivity (building longer sequences from smaller parts), and systematicity (consistent behavior across novel combinations).

## Key Results
- Models achieve 74% accuracy on systematicity tests with 3-hop questions but fail to demonstrate consistent compositional generalization
- Performance drops significantly as question complexity increases from 2-hop to 4-hop scenarios
- Models struggle with novel combinations of seen base components despite seeing similar patterns during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's controlled generation procedure enables systematic testing of compositional properties by creating artificial but structured knowledge graphs. The combination of language models with graph neural networks allows the models to reason over structured knowledge while maintaining natural language understanding capabilities. However, the artificial nature of the knowledge graphs and the focus on question-answering tasks may limit the generalizability of findings to more complex real-world scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Compositional Generalization** - The ability to understand and generate novel combinations of known components. Why needed: This is the core phenomenon being tested. Quick check: Can the model correctly answer questions with unseen combinations of known entities?

**Grounding in Knowledge Graphs** - Linking language to structured knowledge representations. Why needed: The study examines how language models perform when required to reason over structured data. Quick check: Does the model correctly traverse the knowledge graph to find answers?

**Graph Neural Networks** - Neural architectures designed to process graph-structured data. Why needed: These are combined with language models to enable reasoning over knowledge graphs. Quick check: Can the model propagate information across multiple hops in the graph?

**Substitutivity, Productivity, and Systematicity** - Three key properties of compositionality being tested. Why needed: These properties represent fundamental aspects of compositional reasoning. Quick check: Does the model maintain consistent behavior when components are replaced or sequences are extended?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Language Model -> Graph Neural Network -> Output Layer

Critical path: Input question → Language model encoding → Graph traversal → Answer generation

Design tradeoffs: The paper balances between pure language modeling approaches and structured knowledge reasoning, with graph neural networks providing explicit knowledge structure while language models handle natural language understanding.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation with increased sequence length, inability to generalize to novel combinations of seen components, and inconsistent behavior across different compositional properties.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate models on 2-hop questions to establish baseline performance
2. Test substitutivity by replacing entities while keeping structure constant
3. Assess systematicity with novel combinations of seen base components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The evaluation framework relies entirely on synthetic knowledge graphs, which may not capture real-world complexity and noise
- The artificial generation procedure may create overly clean examples that don't reflect natural language ambiguity
- Performance drops with sequence length could be due to factors beyond compositional generalization, such as working memory limitations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that models struggle with compositional generalization in grounded settings is well-supported by consistent results across multiple experimental conditions and model architectures.

**Medium confidence**: The relative performance differences between model architectures and their behavior on different compositional tests are reasonably reliable but could be influenced by dataset-specific factors.

**Low confidence**: The generalizability of specific performance numbers to real-world knowledge graphs and the precise attribution of performance drops to compositional versus other limitations.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the same models and datasets on naturally-occurring knowledge graphs or real-world knowledge bases to assess external validity of the findings.

2. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing different components (syntactic complexity, semantic ambiguity, etc.) to isolate the specific factors that contribute to compositional generalization failures.

3. Test the models on additional task types beyond question-answering (such as instruction following or dialogue) to determine if compositional generalization challenges are task-specific or more fundamental to grounded language understanding.
