## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for expanding seed keyword dictionaries by discovering semantically related terms using tools from manifold learning and network science. LGDE constructs a geometric CkNN graph from word embeddings and applies local community detection based on graph diffusion (severability) to capture chains of semantic associations beyond direct word similarities. This approach effectively accounts for the complex nonlinear geometry of word embedding spaces.

The method is evaluated on two benchmarks: a hate speech corpus and the 20 Newsgroups dataset, where LGDE consistently outperforms baseline methods (thresholding, kNN, IKEA, TextRank) with improved F1 scores and likelihood ratios. In a real-world application analyzing conspiracy-related content on 4chan, LGDE discovers significantly more conspiracy-related keywords than thresholding, including platform-specific jargon and multi-word phrases. The results demonstrate that LGDE is particularly effective for dictionary expansion in dynamic text corpora with evolving semantics and specialized vocabularies.

## Method Summary
LGDE expands seed keyword dictionaries by constructing a geometric CkNN graph from word embeddings and applying local community detection via the severability method. The approach first fine-tunes pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe) to the domain-specific corpus using Mittens retrofitting, then builds a sparse graph representation that captures the nonlinear geometry of the embedding space. Severability uses random walks to explore local graph communities around seed keywords, identifying semantically related terms through chains of associations rather than direct similarity. The method is evaluated using macro F1 scores and likelihood ratios on human-coded benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- LGDE achieves higher F1 scores than baseline methods (thresholding, kNN, IKEA, TextRank) on both hate speech and 20 Newsgroups benchmarks
- In the 4chan conspiracy analysis, LGDE discovers 53 conspiracy-related keywords compared to 20 from thresholding, including platform-specific terms like "glowies" and "glowniggers"
- Performance improves with higher embedding dimensions (300D outperforms 50D and 100D) due to better semantic contrast

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph-based diffusion captures semantic similarity better than direct cosine similarity in high-dimensional word embedding spaces.
- Mechanism: By constructing a CkNN graph from word embeddings, LGDE represents local nonlinear geometry consistently. Severability then uses random walks to explore chains of semantic associations, allowing discovery of words connected via multiple strong links rather than just direct similarity.
- Core assumption: The space of word embeddings is approximately a manifold, and the CkNN graph converges to its intrinsic geometry as data grows.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities."
  - [section 2.2]: "LGDE constructs a graph (a geometric CkNN graph) to represent consistently the geometry of the local manifold of the word embeddings as a means to capture a local representation of the strongest word similarities."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly support manifold learning claims.
- Break condition: If word embeddings are not approximately manifold-structured or if CkNN graph construction fails to capture relevant local geometry.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local community detection via diffusion identifies more representative keywords than fixed-threshold or kNN approaches.
- Mechanism: Severability optimizes a quality function that balances retention (probability of random walker staying in community) and mixing (convergence to quasi-stationary distribution), finding adaptive-sized communities around seed words that capture relevant semantic neighborhoods.
- Core assumption: High-quality seed keywords generate smaller but more specific semantic communities, while lower quality seeds generate larger, more generic communities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LGDE constructs a geometric CkNN graph from word embeddings and applies local community detection based on graph diffusion (severability) to capture chains of semantic associations beyond direct word similarities."
  - [section 3.2.3]: "We find a positive Pearson correlation (ρ) between the LR of the seed keyword and the mean LR of the words in their semantic community, which becomes stronger as the embedding dimension grows."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly support community detection claims.
- Break condition: If severability optimization fails to find meaningful communities or if the retention/mixing tradeoff doesn't capture semantic relevance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific fine-tuning of word embeddings improves semantic capture for specialized vocabularies.
- Mechanism: Mittens retrofitting adapts general-purpose GloVe embeddings to domain-specific corpora by balancing between base embeddings and corpus-specific co-occurrence patterns.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained embeddings capture general semantics that can be refined for domain-specific contexts through fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3]: "We use Mittens (Dingwall & Potts, 2018) to tune the GloVe representations to better represent the semantic relationships in our use-case domains."
  - [section 3.1.2]: "We found that choosing a relatively large µ = 1.0 in Eq. (13) improves word embeddings for various embedding dimensions r = 50, 100, 300."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly support fine-tuning claims.
- Break condition: If domain-specific corpus is too small or too different from general-purpose corpus for fine-tuning to be effective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Manifold learning and graph-based representation of high-dimensional data
  - Why needed here: LGDE relies on representing word embedding space as a manifold through CkNN graphs to capture local geometry
  - Quick check question: What property of high-dimensional spaces makes direct cosine similarity less effective for semantic similarity detection?

- Concept: Random walks and diffusion processes on graphs
  - Why needed here: Severability uses random walks to explore local graph communities and identify semantic associations
  - Quick check question: How does the retention term in severability's quality function relate to the probability of a random walker staying within a community?

- Concept: Word embedding fine-tuning for domain adaptation
  - Why needed here: Mittens retrofitting adapts general-purpose embeddings to specialized vocabularies for better semantic capture
  - Quick check question: What hyperparameter in Mittens controls the balance between base embeddings and domain-specific adaptation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Word embedding fine-tuning (Mittens) → CkNN graph construction → Severability community detection → Dictionary expansion
- Critical path: Seed keywords → Fine-tuned embeddings → CkNN graph → Severability → Expanded dictionary
- Design tradeoffs: Graph construction complexity vs. semantic accuracy; community size vs. precision; fine-tuning extent vs. computational cost
- Failure signatures: Poor F1 scores despite high-dimensional embeddings; discovered keywords with low likelihood ratios; communities that are too large or too small
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify CkNN graph construction produces sparse, meaningful adjacency matrix from embeddings
  2. Test severability on simple synthetic graph with known communities
  3. Compare F1 scores of LGDE vs. thresholding on small benchmark dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does LGDE's performance scale when applied to truly massive vocabularies (e.g., 10^6+ words) in real-time applications?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses LGDE's computational complexity (OpN^2k + nb log2 tq) and evaluates on datasets with N=7,093 and N=10,751 words, but does not test on larger vocabularies.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates LGDE on relatively small vocabularies (thousands of words), leaving uncertainty about its scalability to industrial-scale applications with millions of words.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking LGDE on progressively larger vocabularies (10^4, 10^5, 10^6 words) while measuring runtime and memory usage would establish practical scalability limits.

- Question: Does LGDE maintain its advantage over baseline methods when applied to languages with different morphological structures (e.g., highly agglutinative languages)?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "our method is general and the application could be useful for similar data in other languages" but only evaluates on English data.
  - Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to English, and the effectiveness of word embedding-based methods can vary significantly across languages with different morphological properties.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating LGDE on morphologically rich languages (e.g., Turkish, Finnish, Arabic) and comparing performance to baseline methods would reveal cross-linguistic generalizability.

- Question: How does the choice of k in the CkNN construction affect the trade-off between capturing local geometry and avoiding noise in the graph representation?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "the hyperparameter combinations where the number of discovered words is less than 30 or more than 50 are not considered" and shows results for specific k values, but does not systematically explore this trade-off.
  - Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates optimal k values for specific datasets but does not analyze how varying k affects the balance between local geometric accuracy and noise sensitivity across different data characteristics.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conducting sensitivity analysis by varying k across multiple orders of magnitude and measuring performance metrics (F1, LR) while visualizing graph density and community structure would clarify optimal k selection principles.

## Limitations
- Method relies heavily on domain-specific embedding fine-tuning, which may not scale well to extremely large or heterogeneous corpora
- Severability algorithm's performance depends critically on hyperparameter selection, though specific optimal values are not fully detailed
- Limited evaluation on non-English corpora raises questions about cross-linguistic generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence: LGDE's superior F1 scores compared to baseline methods on benchmark datasets
- Medium confidence: Claims about CkNN graph construction capturing nonlinear geometry (requires further theoretical validation)
- Low confidence: Generalizability to non-English corpora and domains very different from hate speech/20 Newsgroups

## Next Checks
1. Test LGDE's performance on a multilingual corpus to verify cross-linguistic generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the Mittens fine-tuning step to quantify its contribution
3. Evaluate LGDE's scalability on corpora with vocabulary sizes 10× larger than tested benchmarks
