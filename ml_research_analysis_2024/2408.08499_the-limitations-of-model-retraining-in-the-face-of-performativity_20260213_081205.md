# The Limitations of Model Retraining in the Face of Performativity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.08499
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08499
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Naive model retraining fails in performative settings, converging to suboptimal fixed points even for simple linear distribution shifts.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates fundamental limitations of model retraining when data distributions shift based on deployed models. The authors demonstrate that standard retraining approaches converge to performatively stable but suboptimal solutions, with performance gaps that can be arbitrarily large. They show that adding regularization to retraining corrects both the convergence to suboptimal fixed points and finite-sample errors, providing theoretical justification for using regularized retraining in performative settings.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes Repeated Risk Minimization (R-RM) and Repeated Empirical Risk Minimization (R-ERM) algorithms under performative prediction settings. It compares these methods with and without regularization (specifically L2 regularization) across linear distribution shifts including mean shifts and covariance shifts. The analysis includes both theoretical convergence proofs and performance comparisons between different retraining approaches.

## Key Results
- Naive retraining converges to performatively stable points that can be arbitrarily worse than performatively optimal solutions
- With finite samples and constant sample size, R-ERM may not converge to the true performatively stable solution even with infinite time
- Regularization with appropriate parameters ensures convergence to performatively optimal solutions rather than suboptimal stable points
- The regularization strength must increase when covariance shifts are large to achieve optimal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Regularization corrects the gap between performatively stable and performatively optimal solutions
- Mechanism: Regularization slows down parameter updates during retraining, preventing the model from rapidly adapting to shifted distributions that lead to suboptimal fixed points
- Core assumption: The distribution shift function D(θ) is Lipschitz smooth and the loss function ℓ is strongly-convex in θ
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that adding regularization to retraining corrects both of these issues, attaining provably optimal models in the face of distribution shifts"
  - [section 4] "Regularization can also correct the finite sample error incurred by R-ERM"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on different aspects of performativity without addressing regularization specifically
- Break condition: If the regularization parameter λ is set too low or too high relative to the distribution shift magnitude, the correction may fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Finite-sample errors in empirical retraining prevent convergence to the true performatively stable solution
- Mechanism: With constant sample size N across iterations, the variance in parameter updates accumulates and prevents convergence, even with infinite time
- Core assumption: The sample size Nt remains constant across all iterations t
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Theorem 3.2 shows that R-ERM does not converge to θPS even with infinite samples (finite N, but infinite T)"
  - [section 3] "R-ERM does not converge to θPS if Nt is constant throughout iterations t"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighboring papers don't address finite-sample convergence issues specifically
- Break condition: If sample size grows sufficiently fast (e.g., Nt = ω(1/t²)), convergence can be restored without regularization

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adaptive regularization schedules can correct finite-sample errors without requiring growing sample sizes
- Mechanism: By increasing the regularization strength λt over time (e.g., λt = t), the algorithm can compensate for the accumulated variance from finite samples
- Core assumption: The regularization schedule λt increases appropriately with iteration count t
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "With sample complexity Nt = ω(1/t²), e.g. Nt = 1/t or constant Nt = N, Reg-R-ERM for λt = t and R(θ, θt) = 1/2||θ - θt||²₂ converges to θPS"
  - [section 4] "increasing regularization corrects the finite sample error incurred by R-ERM"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - this appears to be a novel contribution
- Break condition: If the regularization growth rate is too slow relative to the sample size and distribution shift magnitude

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Performative prediction and distribution shifts
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire analysis depends on understanding how model predictions influence the data distribution, creating a feedback loop that breaks standard retraining approaches
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes performative risk PR(θ) from standard population risk L(θ) in the context of distribution shifts?

- Concept: Convergence analysis of iterative algorithms
  - Why needed here: The paper proves whether and when retraining algorithms converge to optimal solutions, requiring understanding of fixed-point analysis and stochastic optimization
  - Quick check question: Why does constant sample size N prevent R-ERM from converging to θPS even as T approaches infinity?

- Concept: Regularization as a convergence control mechanism
  - Why needed here: The paper's main contribution is showing how regularization can be used to control the convergence behavior of retraining algorithms in performative settings
  - Quick check question: How does increasing regularization strength over time compensate for finite-sample variance in the updates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Distribution shift model D(θ) -> Loss function ℓ(z; θ) -> Retraining algorithm (R-RM/R-ERM/Reg-R-ERM) -> Regularization module

- Critical path:
  1. Model initialization and deployment
  2. Data collection from current distribution D(θt-1)
  3. Parameter update via regularized empirical risk minimization
  4. Repeat until convergence or stopping criterion met

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sample size vs. regularization strength: Larger samples reduce variance but increase computational cost; stronger regularization improves convergence but may slow adaptation
  - Fixed vs. adaptive regularization: Fixed regularization is simpler but may be suboptimal; adaptive schedules require tuning but can achieve better performance
  - Convergence speed vs. solution quality: Faster convergence may lead to suboptimal solutions; slower convergence with regularization can find better optima

- Failure signatures:
  - Oscillating parameter updates suggesting insufficient regularization
  - Very slow convergence indicating excessive regularization
  - Divergence of parameter estimates suggesting poor regularization schedule choice
  - Gap between training and deployment performance indicating inadequate handling of distribution shifts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the simple scalar case with covariance shift (Theorem 2.3) to verify the performance gap between θPS and θPO without regularization
  2. Test constant regularization λ across iterations to see if it corrects the fixed-point discrepancy
  3. Implement the adaptive schedule λt = t with constant sample size to verify convergence correction for finite-sample errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can regularization always correct the fixed-point discrepancy between retraining and optimal solutions for any distribution shift and loss function?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conjectures that "for every problem where retraining converges to some fixed point, a regularization function can rectify its convergence, forcing it to recover solutions from ΘPS" but leaves this as an open question.
- Why unresolved: This would require proving a general theorem that applies to all possible distribution shifts and loss functions, which is a significant theoretical challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof that for any convergent retraining procedure, there exists a regularization function that forces convergence to ΘPS, or a counterexample showing this is not always possible.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we develop adaptive regularization methods that don't require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters and can estimate them on the fly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "regularization can rectify the fixed point discrepancy" but "can not be implemented in practice without a good approximation of problem-dependent parameters" and suggests this as future work.
- Why unresolved: Current regularization methods require knowing parameters like σ, µ, etc. in advance, which may not be available in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that automatically tunes regularization strength based on observed data without requiring prior knowledge of problem parameters.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does performativity affect learning dynamics in multi-agent settings, particularly with heterogeneous agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "there is some literature on understanding performativity in the presence of multiple agents" but "this area remains largely untackled" and notes its importance for modern ML applications.
- Why unresolved: Most performativity research focuses on single-agent settings, while real-world applications often involve multiple interacting agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework for analyzing performativity with multiple agents, or empirical studies showing how multi-agent dynamics affect model retraining and performance.

## Limitations
- Theoretical results assume linear distribution shifts, limiting generalizability to non-linear performative settings
- Finite-sample convergence results require either growing sample sizes or adaptive regularization schedules that may be impractical
- Proofs rely on strong assumptions about Lipschitz smoothness and strong-convexity that may not hold in complex deep learning applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the fundamental insight that naive retraining converges to suboptimal performatively stable points rather than optimal ones
- **Medium confidence** in the effectiveness of regularization for correcting these issues, as the theoretical bounds depend on problem-specific parameters that may be difficult to tune in practice
- **Low confidence** in the practical applicability of adaptive regularization schedules (λt = t) without extensive empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of regularization effectiveness across non-linear distribution shifts using deep neural networks on real-world performative datasets
2. Sensitivity analysis of regularization parameter selection to identify practical guidelines for choosing λ in different problem settings
3. Comparison of adaptive regularization schedules against alternative approaches like growing sample sizes or ensemble methods in terms of both convergence speed and final performance
