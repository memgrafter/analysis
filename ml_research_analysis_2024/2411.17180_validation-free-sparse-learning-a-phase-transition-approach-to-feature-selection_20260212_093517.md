- Primary result: HarderLASSO achieves validation-free feature selection with phase transitions in exact support recovery probability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HarderLASSO, a validation-free sparse learning method that achieves phase transitions in feature selection probability without requiring cross-validation. The approach extends sparse learning to complex models like neural networks by using a novel non-convex penalty that approximates the ℓ₀ norm more closely than ℓ₁ while remaining computationally tractable. The key innovation is the Quantile Universal Threshold (QUT), which calibrates the regularization parameter under pure noise to ensure exact support recovery with high probability.

The method demonstrates superior performance in both linear and nonlinear settings, consistently selecting fewer features while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. HarderLASSO successfully demonstrates phase transitions in probability of exact support recovery across multiple network architectures, with two-layer networks showing optimal balance between expressiveness and sparsity. On real-world datasets, HarderLASSO QUT selects the smallest feature subsets (often under 20 features) while maintaining accuracy comparable to ensemble methods and cross-validated approaches.

## Method Summary
HarderLASSO combines a non-convex Harder penalty (ρ_ν with ν = 0.1) that approximates the ℓ₀ norm more closely than ℓ₁, with the Quantile Universal Threshold (QUT) for automatic regularization parameter selection. The method uses feature selection compatible MLPs with ℓ₂ row-wise normalized weights to preserve the impact of first-layer regularization. Training proceeds through an annealing schedule over (λ, ν) pairs, starting from convex regularization (ν = 0.9) and gradually moving to the non-convex Harder penalty (ν = 0.1), followed by Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) with line search for final sparse solution. The QUT is computed from pure noise simulations using a pivotal statistic that depends only on centered responses, making it scale and location invariant.

## Key Results
- HarderLASSO achieves validation-free feature selection with phase transitions in exact support recovery probability across multiple network architectures
- On real-world datasets, HarderLASSO QUT selects the smallest feature subsets (often under 20 features) while maintaining accuracy comparable to ensemble methods and cross-validated approaches
- Two-layer neural networks show optimal balance between expressiveness and sparsity, with PESR phase transitions occurring at lower sparsity levels than deeper architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: QUT Calibration Under Pure Noise
The Quantile Universal Threshold (QUT) calibrates λ under pure noise so that P(θ^(1) = 0) = 1 - α, ensuring feature selection is driven by signal rather than noise. QUT computes λ as the upper α-quantile of a pivotal statistic Λ derived from the zero-thresholding function under the null model (no predictive features). This statistic depends only on centered responses and is scale/location invariant, so the exact noise level need not be known. The core assumption is that the statistic Λ is pivotal under the null distribution, meaning its distribution does not depend on unknown nuisance parameters like the noise variance or intercept.

### Mechanism 2: Non-Convex Harder Penalty Approximation
The non-convex "Harder" penalty (ρ_ν with ν = 0.1) approximates ℓ₀ more closely than ℓ₁ while remaining differentiable almost everywhere, enabling better support recovery. The penalty function ρ_ν(θ) = |θ| / (1 + |θ|^(1-ν)) yields a thresholding function that approaches hard thresholding as ν → 0. This reduces shrinkage on true non-zero coefficients compared to ℓ₁, improving bias and exact support recovery. The core assumption is that the non-convex penalty can be optimized efficiently despite non-convexity, and the thresholding behavior is sufficiently close to ℓ₀ for practical support recovery.

### Mechanism 3: Feature Selection Compatible MLP Architecture
Feature selection compatible MLPs with ℓ₂ row-wise normalized weights preserve the impact of first-layer regularization, ensuring that zero weights in W₁ correspond to unselected features. Normalizing each row of W_l (for l ≥ 2) to unit ℓ₂ norm prevents later layers from compensating for small first-layer weights. This ensures that the sparsity-inducing penalty on W₁ directly translates to feature selection. The core assumption is that the activation function is unbounded above and has bounded derivative, so normalization does not distort the representational capacity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Compressed sensing and the ℓ₀/ℓ₁ relaxation**: The paper builds on compressed sensing theory where exact support recovery is possible under certain conditions, extending it to noisy and nonlinear settings. Quick check: What is the key difference between Basis Pursuit (ℓ₁) and the ℓ₀ problem in terms of computational tractability and solution sparsity?

- **Non-convex optimization and local minima**: The Harder penalty is non-convex, so the optimization must handle local minima and requires careful initialization strategies like annealing. Quick check: Why does the paper use an annealing schedule over (λ, ν) pairs instead of directly optimizing with the final Harder parameters?

- **Phase transition in probability of exact support recovery (PESR)**: The paper's main contribution is demonstrating a phase transition in PESR as a function of sparsity level, showing when exact feature selection becomes possible. Quick check: How does the PESR phase transition differ from traditional metrics like FDR or TPR in evaluating feature selection performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input preprocessing (standardization) -> Network architecture (MLP with ℓ₂ normalization) -> Loss function (problem-specific) -> Penalty (Harder ρ_ν) -> Regularization (QUT λ) -> Optimization (annealing + ISTA)

- **Critical path**: 1) Standardize input features, 2) Compute QUT λ from pure noise simulation, 3) Train network with annealing schedule (λ_i, ν_i) starting from (λ_0, ν_0 = 0.9) to (λ_QUT, ν = 0.1), 4) Apply ISTA with line search for final sparse solution, 5) Remove zero-weight neurons and retrain unpenalized reduced model

- **Design tradeoffs**: Harder penalty vs ℓ₁ (better support recovery but harder optimization), QUT vs cross-validation (no validation set needed but assumes noise model), Network depth (more layers increase expressiveness but require more data for good PESR)

- **Failure signatures**: PESR plateaus below 1.0 even at low sparsity (λ too small or penalty too convex), High FDR with low TPR (λ too large or network architecture insufficient), Training instability during annealing (ν too close to zero or learning rate too high)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Verify QUT computation on synthetic data with known sparsity structure, 2) Compare Harder vs ℓ₁ penalty on linear model with increasing sparsity, 3) Test feature selection on a small real dataset with known relevant features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Reliance on pivotal property of threshold statistic under null model - if this property fails in practical settings with weak signals or model misspecification, QUT calibration may become unreliable
- Computational cost of computing quantile threshold through Monte Carlo simulation could be prohibitive for very large-scale problems
- Choice of ν = 0.1 for Harder penalty lacks theoretical justification for optimality across different problem regimes

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The QUT framework for regularization parameter selection is well-grounded in statistical theory, and the phase transition behavior in PESR is clearly demonstrated across multiple synthetic experiments.

**Medium confidence**: The extension to neural networks through ℓ₂ row-wise normalization is theoretically sound, but the practical benefits over simpler architectures need more extensive validation across diverse real-world datasets.

**Medium confidence**: The computational efficiency claims relative to cross-validation approaches are reasonable but depend heavily on implementation details and hardware considerations that aren't fully explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness testing**: Evaluate HarderLASSO performance when the null model assumption is violated by introducing weak signals or model misspecification to assess the stability of QUT calibration.

2. **Scalability analysis**: Measure computational costs of QUT calculation and annealing optimization for increasing problem sizes (p > 10,000 features) to quantify practical limitations.

3. **Architecture sensitivity**: Test whether different neural network depths and widths affect the phase transition behavior, particularly examining whether deeper networks maintain the PESR advantage over traditional methods.
