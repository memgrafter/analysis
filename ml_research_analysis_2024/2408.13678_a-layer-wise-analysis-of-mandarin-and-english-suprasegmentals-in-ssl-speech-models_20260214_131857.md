# A layer-wise analysis of Mandarin and English suprasegmentals in SSL speech models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13678
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13678
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Layer-wise probing reveals that suprasegmental representations are strongest in middle transformer layers, are more abstract than acoustic cues, and are boosted by fine-tuning for lexically contrastive features.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how self-supervised speech models represent suprasegmental features like Mandarin tone, English stress, and phrasal accents. The authors compare English and Mandarin wav2vec 2.0 models layer-wise using probing tasks, revealing that representations of these features are strongest in the middle third of the network and are more abstract than direct acoustic cues. They find that language-specificity in representations is driven by enriched transformer context rather than acoustic encoding. Fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 improves later-layer performance for lexically contrastive features like tone and stress, likely due to improved lexical knowledge. Similar findings hold for HuBERT and WavLM models, with the main difference being later-layer performance. These results highlight the contextual and language-specific nature of suprasegmental representations in SSL speech models.

## Method Summary
The study uses linear probes with L1 regularization to analyze layer-wise representations of suprasegmental features in SSL speech models. Inputs include English Switchboard corpus (75 conversations, 7.5 hours) and Mandarin GTMC corpus (50 speakers, 5.7 hours). Models are probed at each layer using frame-level embeddings extracted from wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and WavLM models. Classifier probes measure F1 scores for categorical tasks (tone, stress, pitch accents), while regression probes measure R-squared for continuous tasks. The analysis compares monolingual English and Mandarin models, examines effects of fine-tuning on ASR performance, and extends results to additional SSL model families.

## Key Results
- Suprasegmental representations peak in the middle third of the transformer network and are more abstract than acoustic cues
- Language-specificity is driven by transformer context rather than acoustic encoding differences
- Fine-tuning improves later-layer performance for lexically contrastive features (tone, stress) more than phrasal features (pitch accents)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Suprasegmental representations are most abstract and discriminative in the middle third of the transformer network.
- Mechanism: Early layers focus on low-level acoustic features, middle layers integrate contextual patterns to form categorical suprasegmental representations, and late layers may specialize toward task-specific lexico-phonetic knowledge.
- Core assumption: The SSL model's pre-training objective (masked prediction) drives the network to progressively transform raw acoustic embeddings into higher-order linguistic abstractions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "representations of these features are strongest in the middle third of the network and are more abstract than direct acoustic cues."
  - [section] "Model representations of suprasegmental categories appear to be independent of their ability to track F0 accurately... implies that model representations are sensitive to abstract linguistic structure and not just acoustic features."
  - [corpus] Weak. No explicit corpus-based acoustic measurement differentiating layers; the claim relies on probe performance rather than direct acoustic feature tracking.
- Break condition: If fine-tuning shifts peak performance to earlier or later layers for suprasegmentals, the "middle third" pattern would no longer hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Language-specificity in suprasegmental representations is driven by enriched transformer context rather than by better acoustic encoding in the CNN feature extractor.
- Mechanism: All models start with similar acoustic embeddings at layer 0; the transformer then applies language-specific contextualization, leading to differential performance in downstream probing tasks.
- Core assumption: The language of pre-training data shapes how transformers weight and combine acoustic features in context, but does not alter the raw acoustic extraction step.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "language-specificity in representations is driven by enriched transformer context rather than acoustic encoding."
  - [section] "Figure 1 shows that representations of suprasegmentals improve through the context network... Layer 0 performance is similar for all models, implying that language specific information is encoded only in the context network."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct comparison of CNN-layer embeddings across languages; inference based on layer-wise probe results.
- Break condition: If layer 0 embeddings differ substantially across languages, the claim that all models develop "similar local representations of the signal" would fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning for ASR improves suprasegmental probe performance more for lexically contrastive features (tone, stress) than for phrasal features (pitch accents).
- Mechanism: ASR fine-tuning indirectly boosts knowledge of lexical identity and distribution; since tone and stress are word-level, this knowledge transfers. Pitch accent, being phrasal, benefits less because it depends on broader prosodic context not captured by ASR fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: ASR fine-tuning strengthens lexical-level modeling even when the probing task does not directly target orthographic labels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 improves later-layer performance for lexically contrastive features like tone and stress, likely due to improved lexical knowledge."
  - [section] "the English model improves for stress after fine-tuning... The Mandarin model improves for tone after fine-tuning... This effect is less clear for English accents, indicating that their representation at the lexical level is weaker."
  - [corpus] Weak. No explicit lexical identity or distributional statistics from the corpus; conclusion drawn from probe performance differences.
- Break condition: If fine-tuning equally boosts phrasal accent representation, the "lexical vs. phrasal" distinction would not explain the observed pattern.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Suprasegmental features
  - Why needed here: The study compares tone (Mandarin), stress (English), and pitch accent (English) as different types of prosodic categories.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between lexical and phrasal suprasegmentals in terms of linguistic scope?
- Concept: Self-supervised speech representation learning
  - Why needed here: The analysis hinges on how masked prediction and context modeling yield abstract linguistic features without explicit labels.
  - Quick check question: How does the masked prediction objective encourage abstraction in transformer layers?
- Concept: Probing methodology
  - Why needed here: The study uses linear classifiers/regressors to measure what information is encoded at each layer.
  - Quick check question: Why might L1 regularization be preferred over L2 in these probing experiments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw waveform -> CNN feature extractor (7 layers) -> Transformer context network (12 layers) -> Probing classifiers/regressors
- Critical path: Raw waveform → CNN → transformer layers 0–12 → probing classifiers/regressors
- Design tradeoffs: Larger transformer depth can capture richer abstractions but increases computational cost and risk of over-specialization in later layers.
- Failure signatures: If probe performance peaks early or is flat across layers, either the model fails to abstract suprasegmentals or the probing task is not sensitive enough.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare F1/R² at layer 0 across languages to confirm equal acoustic encoding.
  2. Run probes with and without L1 regularization to check convergence stability.
  3. Fine-tune on a small ASR dataset and re-run layer-wise probes to verify the lexical-vs-phrasal boost pattern.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the layer-wise representation of suprasegmental features in self-supervised speech models vary with model architecture (e.g., different transformer block designs or embedding sizes)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and WavLM, which differ in pre-training tasks, but notes that architecture might play a role in suprasegmental representation.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on comparing models with similar architectures but different pre-training tasks. It does not explore how architectural variations might influence suprasegmental representation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments varying transformer block designs (e.g., number of layers, attention mechanisms) and embedding sizes within self-supervised speech models, then analyze layer-wise performance on suprasegmental probing tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do multilingual self-supervised speech models represent suprasegmental features compared to monolingual models, and do they exhibit language-specific or language-general representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that multilingual models exhibit similar behavior to monolingual models in terms of suprasegmental representation, but does not provide a detailed comparison.
- Why unresolved: The study primarily focuses on monolingual models and does not extensively explore the representation of suprasegmental features in multilingual models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Train and probe multilingual self-supervised speech models on suprasegmental tasks across multiple languages, then compare their performance and layer-wise behavior to monolingual models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the width of the context window in self-supervised speech models affect the representation of phrasal suprasegmental features like pitch accents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that phrasal accent tasks behave differently from lexical tasks, possibly due to architectural limitations on context width.
- Why unresolved: The study does not explicitly test the effect of context window size on phrasal suprasegmental representation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Train and probe self-supervised speech models with varying context window sizes on phrasal suprasegmental tasks, then analyze how performance changes with context width.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can conditioning probes on earlier layer representations or controlling for lexical identity improve the reliability and interpretability of suprasegmental probing results in self-supervised speech models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions conditioning out earlier layer representations as a potential improvement for future work.
- Why unresolved: The study uses linear probes without conditioning on earlier layers or controlling for lexical identity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implement conditional probing methods that control for earlier layer representations and lexical identity, then compare the results to standard linear probes on suprasegmental tasks.

## Limitations

- Layer-wise probe interpretation may conflate feature encoding with linear separability
- Claims about contextual vs. acoustic encoding rely on indirect evidence from layer-0 similarity
- Fine-tuning effects attribution is inferred from probe performance rather than direct lexical modeling evaluation

## Confidence

- High: The middle-layer peak for suprasegmental probe performance is clearly observed across multiple models and tasks.
- Medium: Claims about contextual vs. acoustic encoding and fine-tuning benefits are well-supported but rely on indirect evidence.
- Low: No direct measurement of acoustic feature tracking vs. linguistic abstraction across layers.

## Next Checks

1. **Direct acoustic feature analysis**: Measure F0, duration, and energy tracking accuracy at each layer to confirm that probe performance gains reflect abstraction rather than better acoustic encoding.
2. **Lexical knowledge probe**: Add a probe for lexical identity (e.g., word classification) to directly test whether fine-tuning boosts lexical-level modeling.
3. **Cross-lingual CNN comparison**: Compare CNN-layer embeddings across languages using a common acoustic feature benchmark to verify the claim of similar local representations.
