# On Leveraging Encoder-only Pre-trained Language Models for Effective Keyphrase Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.14052
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14052
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Encoder-only PLMs with prefix-LM fine-tuning effectively generate keyphrases, outperforming general-domain seq2seq models

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the application of encoder-only Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for keyphrase generation (KPG), addressing three core questions: the efficacy of encoder-only PLMs in KPG, optimal architectural decisions, and performance comparison with encoder-decoder PLMs. Through extensive experimentation in science and news domains, the research demonstrates that prefix-LM fine-tuning of encoder-only PLMs emerges as a strong and data-efficient strategy, outperforming general-domain seq2seq models. The study identifies that a deep encoder with a shallow decoder architecture achieves optimal keyphrase quality and inference latency, providing practical insights for KPG system design.

## Method Summary
The study employs four keyphrase generation formulations using encoder-only PLMs: sequence labeling, sequence labeling with Conditional Random Fields (CRF), prefix-LM fine-tuning, and BERT2BERT initialization. Prefix-LM fine-tuning uses unidirectional attention masks allowing tokens to attend to previous tokens while conditioning on input, enabling sequence generation without a separate decoder. The BERT2BERT approach initializes the encoder with BERT and the decoder with BERT layers. Experiments are conducted on KP20k (science) and KPTimes (news) datasets, evaluating macro-averaged F1@5 and F1@M scores for present and absent keyphrases. The research also explores parameter allocation strategies between encoder and decoder components.

## Key Results
- KPE with Conditional Random Fields slightly excels in identifying present keyphrases, but KPG formulation generates broader spectrum including absent keyphrases
- Prefix-LM fine-tuning of encoder-only PLMs outperforms general-domain seq2seq PLMs as a data-efficient KPG strategy
- Deep encoder with shallow decoder architecture outperforms reverse configuration for keyphrase quality and inference latency
- In-domain encoder-only PLMs (SciBERT, NewsBERT) demonstrate better performance than general-domain BERT in their respective domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Encoder-only PLMs generate absent keyphrases effectively when fine-tuned with prefix-LM style attention masks. The unidirectional decoding allows tokens to attend to previous tokens while conditioning on input, enabling sequence generation without separate decoder. Core assumption: unidirectional attention mask is sufficient for coherent keyphrase generation. Evidence: prefix-LM fine-tuning outperforms general-domain seq2seq PLMs. Break condition: insufficient attention mask for capturing dependencies or overfitting to present keyphrases.

### Mechanism 2
Parameter allocation favoring depth over width improves keyphrase quality and inference latency. Deeper layers build complex input representations crucial for understanding context needed to generate accurate keyphrases. Shallower decoder reduces computational cost without sacrificing quality for generating short keyphrase sequences. Core assumption: encoder's comprehension role is more critical than decoder's generation role. Evidence: performance increases with encoder depth then plateaus. Break condition: task complexity exceeds shallow decoder capacity or documents become significantly longer.

### Mechanism 3
In-domain encoder-only PLMs outperform general-domain models by capturing domain-specific language patterns, terminology, and concepts crucial for accurate keyphrase generation. Core assumption: domain-specific knowledge from pre-training transfers effectively to KPG task. Evidence: in-domain models demonstrate better in-domain performance than BERT. Break condition: domain shift too large or task requires general language understanding beyond domain-specific knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)**: Foundation for keyphrase generation by capturing general language understanding and domain-specific knowledge. Quick check: What are key differences between encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only PLMs?

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Allow PLMs to focus on relevant input parts when generating keyphrases, enabling capture of long-range dependencies and contextual information. Quick check: How does prefix-LM attention mask differ from encoder-decoder attention mechanism?

- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages knowledge from pre-training on large corpora to improve downstream KPG performance, especially with limited labeled data. Quick check: What factors influence transfer learning effectiveness from pre-training to fine-tuning for KPG?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input document -> Encoder (BERT/SciBERT/NewsBERT) -> Prefix-LM attention mask or BERT2BERT decoder -> Output layer (token classification or sequence generation)

- **Critical path**: 1. Preprocess input document 2. Encode document using encoder-only PLM 3. Apply prefix-LM attention mask or initialize BERT2BERT decoder 4. Generate keyphrases using fine-tuned model 5. Postprocess output to extract keyphrases

- **Design tradeoffs**: Depth vs. width (prioritizing depth improves performance but increases cost), encoder-only vs. encoder-decoder (parameter efficiency vs. generative limitations), in-domain vs. general-domain (domain knowledge vs. transferability)

- **Failure signatures**: Low F1@5 or F1@M scores (inaccurate or diverse keyphrases), high computational cost (too deep/wide leading to slow inference), poor in-domain performance (not capturing domain-specific knowledge)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Fine-tune BERT on KP20k using prefix-LM and compare to BERT2BERT and BART baselines 2. Experiment with different parameter allocations (e.g., 8-4, 6-6, 4-8) for BERT2BERT on KP20k and measure performance and latency 3. Fine-tune SciBERT and NewsBERT on their domains using prefix-LM and compare to BERT and in-domain BART baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does performance of encoder-only PLMs for KPG compare to specialized KPE methods in present and absent keyphrase identification? Basis: KPE with CRF slightly excels in present keyphrases but KPG generates broader spectrum. Unresolved because comparison limited to specific architectures and domains. Evidence: extensive benchmarking across multiple architectures, methods, and domains would clarify comparison.

### Open Question 2
What are optimal architectural choices for encoder-only PLMs in KPG and how do they affect performance and computational efficiency? Basis: prefix-LM fine-tuning is effective and deep encoder with shallow decoder is optimal. Unresolved because study focused on specific configurations without exploring full architectural variations. Evidence: systematic experimentation with various architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and configurations would identify optimal choices.

### Open Question 3
How do in-domain encoder-only PLMs compare to general-domain encoder-decoder PLMs across different resource settings? Basis: in-domain encoder-only PLMs outperform general-domain seq2seq models especially in low-resource settings. Unresolved because study considered limited models and did not extensively explore resource settings. Evidence: comprehensive evaluation across various in-domain and general-domain models under different resource settings would clarify relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations

- Results may not generalize beyond science and news domains or to multilingual keyphrase generation
- Performance comparison limited to standard benchmark datasets that may not reflect real-world document complexity
- Study does not extensively explore trade-offs between model size and performance for resource-constrained deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Prefix-LM fine-tuning of encoder-only PLMs as effective KPG strategy; deep encoder with shallow decoder architecture for keyphrase quality and latency

**Medium Confidence**: In-domain encoder-only PLMs outperforming general-domain models (modest absolute gains, boundary conditions not extensively explored)

**Low Confidence**: KPG formulation generating broader spectrum of keyphrases compared to KPE (lacks comprehensive diversity analysis or user validation)

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate encoder-only PLM approaches on diverse domain datasets (medical, legal, social media) to assess cross-domain generalization beyond science and news

2. Test model performance on documents significantly longer than benchmark datasets to determine if deep encoder with shallow decoder architecture maintains advantages with extended input sequences

3. Conduct comprehensive computational efficiency analysis measuring memory usage, inference latency, and parameter efficiency across different hardware configurations to validate practical deployment advantages
