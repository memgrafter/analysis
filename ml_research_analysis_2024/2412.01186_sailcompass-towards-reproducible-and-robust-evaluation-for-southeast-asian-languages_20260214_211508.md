# SailCompass: Towards Reproducible and Robust Evaluation for Southeast Asian Languages

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.01186
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01186
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces SailCompass, a reproducible and robust evaluation benchmark for LLMs on Southeast Asian languages covering three main SEA languages and eight primary tasks across 14 datasets.

## Executive Summary
SailCompass introduces a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Large Language Models (LLMs) on Southeast Asian languages. The benchmark addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation in a linguistically diverse region by covering three main SEA languages across eight task types including generation, multiple-choice questions, and classification tasks. The authors emphasize reproducibility by making all datasets and evaluation scripts publicly available, while improving evaluation robustness through systematic exploration of prompt configurations and calibration techniques. The findings reveal that SEA-specialized LLMs still outperform general LLMs, highlight the importance of balanced language distribution for developing better SEA models, and demonstrate the necessity of advanced prompting techniques for optimal LLM utilization.

## Method Summary
The SailCompass benchmark systematically evaluates LLMs across 14 datasets spanning eight primary task types in three Southeast Asian languages. The authors address evaluation robustness by exploring different prompt configurations specifically for multiple-choice questions and implementing calibration methods for classification tasks. The benchmark covers a comprehensive range of tasks including generation, classification, and question-answering formats. To ensure reproducibility, all datasets and evaluation scripts are made publicly available, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon the work. The evaluation framework emphasizes the importance of balanced language representation and explores how different prompting strategies affect model performance across diverse SEA language contexts.

## Key Results
- SEA-specialized LLMs still outperform general LLMs on Southeast Asian language tasks
- Balanced language distribution is crucial for developing better SEA language models
- Advanced prompting techniques are necessary to better utilize LLMs in SEA language contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SailCompass benchmark works by providing a standardized, reproducible framework for evaluating LLMs on Southeast Asian languages, addressing the lack of comprehensive evaluation resources for this linguistically diverse region. The mechanism of improving evaluation robustness through systematic prompt configuration exploration and calibration helps mitigate variability in model responses and provides more reliable performance measurements. By covering multiple task types and ensuring balanced language representation, the benchmark captures the full spectrum of linguistic challenges present in SEA languages, from morphologically complex words to context-dependent meanings.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Language-specific evaluation benchmarks** - Why needed: SEA languages have unique linguistic features requiring specialized evaluation; Quick check: Does the benchmark include typologically diverse SEA languages?
2. **Prompt engineering for LLMs** - Why needed: Different task types require different prompting strategies; Quick check: Are prompt configurations systematically varied across all task types?
3. **Model calibration techniques** - Why needed: Classification tasks need calibrated confidence scores for reliable evaluation; Quick check: Are calibration methods applied consistently across classification datasets?
4. **Cross-lingual generalization** - Why needed: Models should perform well across all SEA languages, not just dominant ones; Quick check: Is there balanced representation across the three main SEA languages?
5. **Reproducible research practices** - Why needed: Ensures other researchers can verify and build upon findings; Quick check: Are all datasets, code, and evaluation metrics publicly accessible?
6. **Multitask evaluation** - Why needed: Real-world applications require diverse capabilities beyond single task types; Quick check: Does the benchmark include both generation and comprehension tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Datasets (14) -> Task Types (8) -> Prompt Configurations -> Model Evaluations -> Performance Metrics -> Calibration

**Critical path:** Dataset preparation → Task type assignment → Prompt configuration exploration → Model inference → Performance aggregation → Calibration adjustment

**Design tradeoffs:** Comprehensive language coverage vs. depth of evaluation per language; Reproducibility vs. computational efficiency; Task diversity vs. focused expertise development

**Failure signatures:** Inconsistent performance across similar task types; High variance in multiple-choice responses; Poor calibration in classification tasks; Language-specific performance gaps

**3 first experiments:**
1. Evaluate a general LLM vs. SEA-specialized LLM on identical datasets to verify the performance gap claim
2. Systematically remove advanced prompting techniques to quantify their contribution to performance
3. Test the benchmark with a fourth SEA language not included in the original evaluation to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- No independent reproduction verification has been conducted to confirm claimed reproducibility
- Limited language coverage (three main SEA languages) may not capture full linguistic diversity
- No detailed statistical analysis of comparative claims between SEA-specialized and general LLMs

## Confidence
- **Reproducibility claims:** Medium - datasets and scripts are publicly available but no independent verification exists
- **Evaluation robustness:** Medium - improvements mentioned but specific methodologies not detailed
- **Comparative LLM performance:** Medium - significant claims about SEA-specialized models but lacking detailed experimental validation
- **Language coverage adequacy:** Medium - three main languages provide coverage but may not be representative of full SEA linguistic diversity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent reproduction attempts using the publicly available datasets and evaluation scripts to verify claimed reproducibility
2. Expand evaluation to include additional SEA languages beyond the three main ones to test generalizability of findings
3. Perform systematic ablation studies removing advanced prompting techniques to quantify their actual contribution to performance improvements
