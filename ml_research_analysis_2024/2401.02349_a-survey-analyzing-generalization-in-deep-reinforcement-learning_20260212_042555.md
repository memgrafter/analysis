# A Survey Analyzing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.02349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02349
- Authors: Ezgi Korkmaz
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey analyzing generalization in deep reinforcement learning with a unified framework categorizing approaches based on MDP variations

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic analysis of generalization in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), identifying fundamental challenges and organizing solution approaches into a unified framework. The paper introduces a formal definition of generalization that categorizes methods based on which part of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is expected to vary, covering algorithmic modifications, reward transformations, state transformations, transition probability transformations, and policy transformations. Key root causes of limited generalization are identified as the exploration vs exploitation trade-off and overestimation bias in value functions. The survey comprehensively covers data augmentation, adversarial training, regularization techniques, meta-reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and lifelong learning approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive literature review and theoretical analysis of generalization in DRL, synthesizing findings from multiple subfields into a unified framework. The method involves formalizing generalization concepts through MDP variations, analyzing root causes of overfitting (overestimation bias and exploration limitations), and systematically categorizing solution approaches. The survey evaluates empirical evidence across different DRL domains and architectures, organizing techniques into coherent categories while identifying gaps and open questions in current research.

## Key Results
- Introduced a unified framework categorizing generalization methods based on which part of the MDP varies (rewards, observations, dynamics, or policy)
- Identified overestimation bias in value functions and exploration limitations as fundamental causes of poor generalization
- Organized solution approaches into data augmentation, adversarial training, regularization, meta-reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and lifelong learning
- Provided comprehensive coverage of adversarial attacks and defenses in DRL contexts
- Offered systematic guideline for current advancements and limitations in DRL generalization research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The paper's unified framework categorizes generalization methods by which part of the MDP is expected to vary, enabling systematic comparison across subfields.
- Mechanism: By defining generalization through rewards, observations, environment dynamics, or policy transformation, researchers can clearly identify whether they're targeting distributional shift, adversarial robustness, or transfer learning scenarios.
- Core assumption: Different generalization approaches can be meaningfully classified by what aspect of the MDP they modify.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a unified framework categorizing different approaches to achieve and assess generalization based on which part of the MDP (Markov Decision Process) is expected to vary."
  - [section 3] Formal definitions of algorithmic generalization, rewards transforming generalization, state transforming generalization, transition probability transforming generalization, and policy transforming generalization.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on different aspects but don't provide direct validation of this classification framework.
- Break condition: When a generalization technique simultaneously modifies multiple MDP components in ways that don't fit cleanly into one category, or when the classification becomes ambiguous for hybrid approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Overestimation bias in value functions is a fundamental cause of limited generalization in deep RL.
- Mechanism: The max operator in Q-learning creates statistical bias because E[max(X)] ≠ max(E[X]), leading to systematically overestimated state-action values that generalize poorly to unseen states.
- Core assumption: Function approximation errors accumulate and interact with the max operator to create persistent overestimation bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Thrun and Schwartz (1993) proves that if the reinforcement learning policy overestimates the state-action values by γc during learning then the Q-learning algorithm will fail to learn optimal policy if γ > 1/(1 + c)."
  - [section 4] "Several parts of the deep reinforcement learning process can cause overestimation bias... coupling between value function and the optimal policy (Raileanu and Fergus, 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't contain direct validation of this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: When double estimators or other bias-correction techniques completely eliminate overestimation without affecting performance, or when overestimation is shown to be beneficial in certain generalization scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Exploration strategies that increase state space coverage during training lead to better generalization to unseen states.
- Mechanism: Limited exploration creates a sampling bias where the learned value function is accurate only in frequently visited regions, causing poor generalization to rarely visited or unseen states.
- Core assumption: The agent's ability to generalize is directly proportional to the diversity and coverage of states explored during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "The fact that we are not able to completely explore the entire MDP for high dimensional state representation MDPs, even with deep neural networks as function approximators, is one of the root problems that limits generalization."
  - [section 5] "Some studies demonstrated these problems via adversarial perturbations introduced to the state observations of the policy (Huang et al., 2017; Kos and Song, 2017; Korkmaz, 2022; Korkmaz and Brown-Cohen, 2023)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't directly address exploration's role in generalization.
- Break condition: When exploration strategies that increase state coverage actually decrease performance due to sample inefficiency, or when generalization improves despite limited exploration.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP) formalism
  - Why needed here: The entire survey framework is built on understanding how different MDP components (states, actions, rewards, transitions) can vary, making this foundational for understanding generalization approaches.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between modifying the reward function versus modifying the state observations in an MDP, and why each would be considered a different generalization strategy?

- Concept: Function approximation and its limitations
  - Why needed here: Deep neural networks as function approximators introduce bias and variance that directly impact generalization capabilities, and understanding these limitations is crucial for evaluating different regularization approaches.
  - Quick check question: Why does using a single max operator in Q-learning lead to overestimation bias, and how does this relate to the challenges of function approximation in high-dimensional spaces?

- Concept: Statistical bias in reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The paper extensively discusses how various statistical biases (overestimation, sampling bias from limited exploration) limit generalization, requiring understanding of how these biases arise and propagate.
  - Quick check question: Explain why E[max(X)] ≠ max(E[X]) for random variables X, and how this mathematical fact creates challenges for value-based reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Unified framework (MDP variations) -> Root causes (overestimation bias, exploration limitations) -> Solution categories (data augmentation, adversarial training, regularization, meta-RL, transfer learning, lifelong learning)

- Critical path: Understanding the unified framework (section 3) is essential before diving into specific techniques, as it provides the vocabulary and classification system used throughout the survey. The core components are the definitions in section 3, the analysis of overestimation bias in section 4, and the regularization techniques in section 6.

- Design tradeoffs: The unified framework provides systematic classification but may oversimplify complex hybrid approaches. The survey covers breadth over depth, providing an overview rather than detailed implementation guidance. The focus on deep RL means some classical RL generalization techniques may be underrepresented.

- Failure signatures: When a technique doesn't fit cleanly into the defined categories, or when empirical results contradict the theoretical framework. When adversarial training improves robustness but decreases performance on clean data, indicating a tradeoff not captured by the framework.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the state transforming generalization framework by applying data augmentation techniques (cropping, rotation, color jitter) to a standard DQN agent and measuring performance on both training and test environments.
  2. Test the overestimation bias mechanism by comparing standard DQN with double DQN on environments with varying levels of function approximation error, measuring both performance and value function accuracy.
  3. Evaluate exploration's impact on generalization by comparing ϵ-greedy exploration with more sophisticated exploration strategies (count-based, curiosity-driven) on environments designed to test out-of-distribution generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the most effective way to formalize generalization in deep reinforcement learning across different MDP variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper aims to "formalize and analyze generalization in deep reinforcement learning" and introduces a "unified framework categorizing different approaches to achieve and assess generalization based on which part of the MDP is expected to vary."
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a comprehensive categorization of generalization approaches, it does not definitively establish which formalization is most effective across all scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of different formalization methods across a wide range of MDP variations and their impact on policy performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we design exploration strategies that effectively balance exploration vs exploitation in high-dimensional state spaces to prevent overfitting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "exploration vs exploitation trade-off" as one of the "fundamental reasons for limited generalization in DRL" and discusses various exploration strategies.
- Why unresolved: Despite numerous exploration strategies proposed, the paper notes that "even though it is possible to use deep neural networks as function approximators for large state spaces, the agent will simply not be able to explore the full state space."
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of exploration strategies that demonstrably improve generalization in high-dimensional state spaces without excessive computational cost.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the underlying causes of overestimation bias in state-action value functions, and how can we effectively mitigate it?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses "overestimation bias in value functions" as a "fundamental reason for limited generalization in DRL" and reviews various methods to address it.
- Why unresolved: While multiple methods have been proposed (e.g., double Q-learning, target networks), the paper suggests that "several parts of the deep reinforcement learning process can cause overestimation bias."
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis identifying all sources of overestimation bias and developing a unified approach to mitigate them across different DRL algorithms.

## Limitations
- The unified framework may oversimplify complex hybrid approaches that combine multiple generalization strategies
- Empirical validation of the theoretical mechanisms (overestimation bias, exploration limitations) is limited to individual studies rather than systematic comparisons
- The survey's broad scope sacrifices depth in implementation details and specific hyperparameter recommendations

## Confidence
- High confidence: The unified framework provides valuable organizational structure for understanding generalization approaches
- Medium confidence: The identification of overestimation bias and exploration limitations as root causes is well-supported but may oversimplify complex interactions
- Low confidence: The relative effectiveness of different regularization techniques across diverse DRL scenarios lacks comprehensive empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement systematic ablation studies testing whether the unified framework accurately captures the relationships between different generalization techniques, particularly for hybrid approaches that combine multiple strategies.

2. Conduct controlled experiments isolating overestimation bias effects by comparing agents with varying levels of function approximation error and different value estimation methods (single vs. double estimators) across multiple DRL domains.

3. Design benchmark environments specifically targeting the identified root causes (exploration bias, overestimation) to measure whether improvements in these areas translate to meaningful generalization gains in realistic scenarios.
