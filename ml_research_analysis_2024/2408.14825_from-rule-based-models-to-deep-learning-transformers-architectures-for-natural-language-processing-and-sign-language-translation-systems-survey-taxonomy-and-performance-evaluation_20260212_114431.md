# From Rule-Based Models to Deep Learning Transformers Architectures for Natural Language Processing and Sign Language Translation Systems: Survey, Taxonomy and Performance Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.14825
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14825
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Encoder-decoder transformers achieve BLEU scores up to 52.7 for gloss-to-text translation in sign language machine translation systems

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines sign language machine translation (SLMT) systems, presenting a taxonomy of sign language components and evaluating transformer architectures for gloss-to-text translation. The authors find that encoder-decoder transformers consistently outperform other transformer types, achieving BLEU scores up to 52.7. The study identifies key challenges including data scarcity, high deployment costs, and privacy concerns, while proposing solutions such as crowdsourced data collection, cloud-edge computing, and blockchain for secure data management. Future research directions include quantum computing for faster training and integrating sign language features for improved accuracy.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic survey of SLMT literature, analyzing rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches. Empirical evaluations compare four transformer architectures (encoder-decoder, encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder fusion) on gloss-to-text translation using the PHOENIX-2014T and custom MedASL datasets. The study performs hyperparameter tuning across configurations and evaluates performance using BLEU, ROUGE, and WER metrics. The authors also propose a taxonomy framework for SLMT components and stages, identifying gaps in current research and future directions.

## Key Results
- Encoder-decoder transformers achieve BLEU scores up to 52.7, outperforming other transformer architectures in gloss-to-text translation
- Gloss representation serves as an effective intermediate layer between sign language and spoken language, improving translation accuracy
- Hyperparameter tuning (number of heads, hidden units) significantly impacts transformer performance in SLMT tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Encoder-decoder transformer architectures consistently outperform other transformer types in sign language gloss-to-text translation.
- **Mechanism:** The encoder captures contextual information from the sign language gloss sequence, while the decoder generates the corresponding spoken language text token-by-token, leveraging the encoder's output. This end-to-end sequence-to-sequence modeling aligns with the natural structure of sign language sentences.
- **Core assumption:** Gloss representation preserves the full semantic and grammatical content of the original sign language, allowing the decoder to produce accurate text.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "finding that encoder-decoder transformers outperform other architectures, achieving BLEU scores up to 52.7."
  - [section]: "When comparing the architecture applied in S2G and G2S, we notice that the one in [134] is the most effective... When comparing the architecture applied in S2G and G2S, we notice that the one in [134] is the most effective. We believe that this is due to the architecture parameters."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence available; inference based on survey results.
- **Break condition:** If gloss representation is incomplete or ambiguous, the decoder cannot recover the full meaning, leading to degraded translation quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Gloss representation acts as an intermediate linguistic layer that bridges sign language and spoken language, improving translation accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** By converting dynamic sign movements into a discrete gloss sequence, the system reduces the complexity of mapping between visual gestures and spoken language. Glosses encode grammatical structures and semantic content in a form more amenable to NLP models.
- **Core assumption:** Glosses are a faithful and standardized representation of sign language, capturing both lexical and grammatical information.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "There has been a wealth of research on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few works on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the language being continuous and dynamic."
  - [section]: "The introduction of gloss contributes to higher precision when translating from sign to text [18], or when generating signs [19]."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence available; inference based on survey results.
- **Break condition:** If gloss annotation is inconsistent or glosses fail to capture non-manual markers (facial expressions, body shifts), translation accuracy suffers.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hyperparameter tuning (number of heads, hidden units) significantly impacts transformer performance in SLMT tasks.
- **Mechanism:** Increasing the number of attention heads and hidden units allows the model to capture more complex dependencies and relationships in the sign language data, leading to better translation quality.
- **Core assumption:** Larger models with more parameters can learn richer representations, provided sufficient data and compute.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "empirical evaluations of transformer architectures for gloss-to-text translation."
  - [section]: "Regarding hyperparameter tuning, our results reveal that EDT and DOT architectures' performance increased with the increasing number of heads and hidden units."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence available; inference based on experimental results.
- **Break condition:** If model size exceeds available data, overfitting occurs; if too small, model cannot capture necessary complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Gloss representation in sign language translation.
  - **Why needed here:** Glosses are the intermediate representation between sign language and spoken language. Understanding how glosses are defined, annotated, and used is critical for SLMT system design.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key components of a sign language gloss (e.g., manual markers, non-manual markers, classifiers)?

- **Concept:** Transformer architecture components (encoder, decoder, attention mechanisms).
  - **Why needed here:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for SLMT. Understanding the roles of the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanisms is essential for designing and tuning SLMT models.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the multi-head attention mechanism in the encoder help capture relationships between different parts of the input sequence?

- **Concept:** Evaluation metrics for machine translation (BLEU, ROUGE, WER, Accuracy).
  - **Why needed here:** Accurate evaluation is crucial for comparing different SLMT approaches. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each metric is important for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between BLEU and ROUGE, and when would you use each?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sign language videos -> Video frame extraction -> Feature extraction (3D CNN, OpenPose) -> Gloss tokenization -> Transformer model -> Text output
- **Critical path:** 1. Data preparation (video, gloss, text alignment) -> 2. Feature extraction (visual features from sign videos) -> 3. Model training (transformer with appropriate loss function) -> 4. Hyperparameter tuning (number of heads, layers, hidden units) -> 5. Evaluation (multiple metrics on held-out data)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Model size vs. data availability: Larger models require more data to avoid overfitting; Speed vs. accuracy: More complex models may be slower but more accurate; Gloss representation vs. direct translation: Glosses improve accuracy but add annotation overhead
- **Failure signatures:** Low BLEU/ROUGE scores: Model not learning meaningful representations; High WER: Tokenization or alignment issues; Overfitting: Large gap between training and validation performance; Slow inference: Model too large or inefficient
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Train a basic encoder-decoder transformer on a small, clean dataset (e.g., PHOENIX-2014T subset) to establish baseline performance; 2. Experiment with different numbers of attention heads and hidden units to find optimal architecture size; 3. Compare encoder-decoder transformer performance against encoder-only and decoder-only variants on the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the comparative performance of human sign language interpreters versus automated SLMT systems in terms of translation speed and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses real-time translation requirements and mentions that no work provides a comparative analysis between human interpreters and SLMT systems in terms of execution time.
- Why unresolved: The authors explicitly state that this comparison has not been conducted, leaving uncertainty about how SLMT systems currently compare to human performance in practical scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study measuring both translation speed (latency) and accuracy (using metrics like BLEU, WER) for human interpreters and SLMT systems on the same sign language content.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different Transformer architectures (encoder-decoder, encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder fusion) compare in terms of performance across all translation directions (S2G, G2T, T2G, G2S, S2T, S2G2T)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "no works compare all four types of transformers in each translation phase" and that this gap should be filled in future works.
- Why unresolved: While the paper conducts some comparative analysis, it does not comprehensively evaluate all four Transformer architectures across all six translation directions in a unified experimental setup.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic empirical study testing all four Transformer architectures on the same datasets across all six translation directions, reporting standardized performance metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How effective are quantum computing approaches for improving the training efficiency and real-time performance of large-scale SLMT models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify quantum computing as a promising future direction for reducing computational time required for training deep learning models on large datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents this as a future research direction without any experimental evidence or preliminary results demonstrating quantum computing's effectiveness for SLMT specifically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of quantum-inspired or actual quantum computing algorithms for SLMT model training, comparing training time, resource usage, and translation quality against classical approaches.

## Limitations

- Empirical evaluation is limited by the small size of the custom MedASL dataset (500 sentences), which may not be representative of broader sign language use cases
- Several architectural configurations marked as "NR" (not reported) in the hyperparameter tables create gaps in the comparative analysis
- Performance metrics are based on established NLP measures (BLEU, ROUGE, WER) that may not fully capture the unique aspects of sign language translation quality

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The finding that encoder-decoder transformers outperform other architectures in gloss-to-text translation is well-supported by multiple experimental comparisons across different datasets (PHOENIX-2014T and MedASL). The mechanism of encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence modeling aligns with established NLP principles and the results are consistent across evaluation metrics.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that gloss representation improves translation accuracy has strong theoretical support but limited empirical validation. While the survey identifies gloss as an important intermediate layer, the quality and consistency of gloss annotation across different sign languages and annotators is not evaluated. The effectiveness of gloss depends heavily on annotation quality, which varies across datasets.

**Low Confidence:** The assertion that hyperparameter tuning (number of heads, hidden units) significantly impacts performance is based on limited experimental configurations. The study shows general trends but does not provide systematic hyperparameter optimization or sensitivity analysis. The specific impact of individual hyperparameters on translation quality remains unclear due to incomplete reporting of all configuration combinations.

## Next Checks

1. **Gloss Quality Validation:** Conduct an inter-annotator agreement study on gloss annotation for a subset of sign language videos to quantify annotation consistency and identify sources of variation. This would establish the reliability of gloss as an intermediate representation.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Train and evaluate the same transformer architectures on at least three additional sign language datasets with different languages (e.g., British Sign Language, Japanese Sign Language) to test whether the encoder-decoder advantage generalizes beyond German and American Sign Language.

3. **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Analysis:** Perform a systematic grid search or Bayesian optimization over the full hyperparameter space (number of layers, heads, hidden units, learning rates) for each transformer architecture to identify optimal configurations and quantify the sensitivity of performance to each parameter.
