# Advancing Vietnamese Visual Question Answering with Transformer and Convolutional Integration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21229
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21229
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 71.04% accuracy on ViVQA dataset by integrating BLIP-2 and EfficientNet visual features with BEiT-3 fusion

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel approach for Vietnamese Visual Question Answering (ViVQA) that integrates transformer-based and convolutional methods to enhance image representation. By combining the global features extracted by BLIP-2 and the local features from EfficientNet, the proposed model achieves a significant improvement in performance. The model further leverages a multi-modal fusion module based on BEiT-3 to integrate visual and textual information. Experimental results on the ViVQA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baselines, achieving an accuracy of 71.04%. This research highlights the importance of combining local and global features for effective image representation in VQA tasks, particularly for low-resource languages like Vietnamese.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates transformer-based and convolutional approaches for Vietnamese Visual Question Answering. Visual features are extracted using BLIP-2 for global context and EfficientNet-B7 for local details, then concatenated. Textual features are processed through BARTpho and reduced in dimension before concatenation with visual features. A BEiT-3 multi-modal fusion module with shared self-attention and modality-specific experts performs cross-modal integration. The model is trained for 20 epochs with frozen pre-trained backbones using AdamW optimizer, batch size 65, and learning rate 3e-5.

## Key Results
- Achieves 71.04% accuracy on ViVQA test set, surpassing existing baselines
- Freezing pre-trained models significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance
- Multi-modal fusion using BEiT-3 enables effective integration of visual and textual information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Freezing pre-trained vision and text models reduces training cost without degrading accuracy.
- Mechanism: By keeping the parameters of BLIP-2, EfficientNet, and BARTpho fixed during training, the model avoids updating billions of parameters, reducing computational load and training time.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained models have already learned generalizable representations suitable for the ViVQA task.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining high performance; section describes BLIP-2's global feature extraction capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining local and global visual features improves image representation for VQA.
- Mechanism: Local features from EfficientNet capture fine-grained object details; global features from BLIP-2 capture contextual relationships. Concatenating them preserves both levels of abstraction.
- Core assumption: VQA tasks benefit from both detailed local cues (e.g., object attributes) and global context (e.g., scene layout).
- Evidence anchors: Abstract highlights integration of transformer-based architectures for contextual information and convolutional networks for local features; section discusses the sophisticated combination of current improvements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiway Transformer fusion dynamically routes modality-specific information to improve cross-modal alignment.
- Mechanism: BEiT-3's Multiway Transformer uses shared self-attention plus modality-specific experts to jointly encode image-question pairs, allowing deep interaction without early modality collapse.
- Core assumption: Modality-specific experts can learn complementary patterns while shared attention aligns them semantically.
- Evidence anchors: Section describes BEiT-3's composition of shared self-attention module and feed-forward networks tailored for diverse modalities; abstract mentions leveraging BEiT-3 for fusing visual and textual features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning with frozen backbones
  - Why needed here: Reduces parameter count and training time while leveraging strong pre-trained representations for low-resource Vietnamese VQA.
  - Quick check question: What happens to model performance if we unfreeze the vision backbone during fine-tuning?

- Concept: Multi-scale visual feature fusion
  - Why needed here: Local CNN features capture object details; global transformer features capture context; together they improve answer accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Which feature type (local or global) contributes more to correct answers on object-centric questions?

- Concept: Multiway multimodal fusion
  - Why needed here: Joint encoding of image and text with modality experts avoids early modality collapse and allows deep interaction.
  - Quick check question: How does the number of encoder layers affect the model's ability to align visual and textual tokens?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → BLIP-2 + EfficientNet-B7 → concat → BEiT-3 → answer prediction
- Critical path: Image → BLIP-2 (global features) + EfficientNet (local features) → concatenated features → BEiT-3 Multiway Transformer → classification head
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing vs fine-tuning: freezing saves compute but may limit adaptation
  - Concatenation vs other fusion ops: concatenation preserves both feature types but increases dimensionality
  - Encoder depth: deeper encoders capture more complex interactions but risk overfitting on small datasets
- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy plateaus early → possible misalignment of frozen backbones
  - Local-only or global-only models underperform → missing complementary information
  - Low precision/recall imbalance → modality dominance in fusion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare accuracy with frozen vs unfrozen EfficientNet backbone
  2. Replace concatenation with element-wise addition to test fusion sensitivity
  3. Vary encoder layers (4, 6, 8) to find optimal depth for Vietnamese VQA

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- Weak empirical validation for core mechanisms, particularly regarding freezing pre-trained models and local-global feature fusion
- Limited ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of different architectural components
- Acknowledged dataset quality issues with low-quality and limited question types affecting model generalization

## Confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study comparing the proposed method with variants using only local or global features to quantify their individual contributions
2. Perform a fine-tuning vs. freezing comparison for the EfficientNet backbone to assess the trade-off between performance and computational cost
3. Evaluate the model's robustness on object-centric vs. context-heavy questions to determine which feature type (local or global) is more critical for different question types
