core_contribution: This paper introduces C3-NeRF, a conditional-cum-continual learning
  framework that enables a single neural radiance field to model multiple 3D scenes
  incrementally. By combining scene conditioning through pseudo-labels with generative
  replay, C3-NeRF adapts to new scenes without requiring access to old training data,

# Incremental Multi-Scene Modeling via Continual Neural Graphics Primitives

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.19903
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19903
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** C3-NeRF models 8 scenes with only 2.2% PSNR drop versus individual NeRF models while avoiding catastrophic forgetting

## Executive Summary
C3-NeRF introduces a continual learning framework for neural radiance fields that enables a single model to incrementally learn multiple 3D scenes without catastrophic forgetting. The approach combines conditional scene modeling through pseudo-labels with generative replay to adapt to new scenes while maintaining performance on previously learned ones. By modifying Instant-NGP's hashing mechanism to incorporate scene labels, C3-NeRF achieves high-quality novel-view synthesis across multiple scenes while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

## Method Summary
C3-NeRF addresses the challenge of incremental multi-scene learning by extending Instant-NGP with scene conditioning and generative replay. The method introduces a scene label embedding that is concatenated with positional encoding and passed through the hashing mechanism, allowing the network to distinguish between different scenes. For each new scene, the framework uses pseudo-labels for initial scene identification and employs generative replay to prevent forgetting of previously learned scenes. The architecture maintains the efficiency of Instant-NGP while adding the ability to model multiple scenes within a single model, avoiding the need for separate networks per scene.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.2% PSNR drop when modeling all 8 NeRF Synthetic 360° scenes compared to individually optimized NeRF models
- Maintains real-time rendering speeds while supporting incremental multi-scene learning
- Successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting through combined conditional learning and generative replay

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
C3-NeRF works by extending neural radiance fields with scene-specific conditioning that allows a single network to represent multiple scenes. The key mechanism involves modifying the input representation to include scene identifiers that are processed through the hashing mechanism, enabling the network to learn scene-specific features while sharing common representations. Generative replay provides additional supervision from previously learned scenes, preventing the network from overwriting important parameters when learning new scenes. This combination allows the model to incrementally adapt to new scenes while preserving the ability to render high-quality novel views of previously seen scenes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF):** A technique for representing 3D scenes using coordinate-based MLPs that can render novel views through volumetric rendering. Needed because it forms the basis for 3D scene representation and rendering.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** The phenomenon where neural networks lose previously learned information when trained on new tasks. Quick check: Can the model still render old scenes after learning new ones?
- **Continual Learning:** Learning paradigms where models are trained sequentially on multiple tasks without revisiting old data. Needed because the paper addresses incremental scene learning.
- **Generative Replay:** A technique where a generative model produces samples from previous tasks to prevent forgetting. Quick check: Does replay improve performance on old scenes?
- **Conditional Neural Networks:** Networks that take additional conditioning information to produce task-specific outputs. Needed because scene identification requires conditional processing.
- **Hashing in Neural Networks:** Techniques like those in Instant-NGP that use hash tables for efficient feature lookup. Quick check: Does the hashing modification improve scene discrimination?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input (position + view direction + scene label) -> Hashing with scene conditioning -> MLP network -> Volume rendering -> Output image

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves the modified hashing mechanism that incorporates scene labels, which determines how scene-specific features are extracted and processed. This is followed by the MLP that generates color and density predictions, and finally the volume rendering step that produces the final image.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades increased model complexity (scene conditioning and replay mechanisms) for the ability to model multiple scenes with a single network. This reduces storage requirements and enables incremental learning but may slightly reduce per-scene performance compared to dedicated models.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failures include confusion between similar scenes when pseudo-labels are noisy, performance degradation as the number of scenes increases, and computational overhead from maintaining replay samples for multiple scenes.

**First Experiments:** 1) Evaluate scene discrimination ability with different label noise levels, 2) Measure performance degradation when scaling to more than 8 scenes, 3) Compare with scene-specific baselines on complex real-world scenes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to synthetic scenes without real-world complexity like dynamic content or varying lighting
- No systematic analysis of pseudo-label assignment sensitivity or label noise robustness
- Memory overhead from generative replay samples not thoroughly analyzed for large scene collections

## Confidence
- **Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation:** High - Well-established continual learning approach with strong empirical results
- **Scene Conditioning via Hashing Modification:** High - Clear technical modification with demonstrable effectiveness
- **Real-time Performance:** Medium - Claimed but hardware specifications and complexity limits not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on pseudo-label quality to quantify sensitivity to label noise and initialization methods
2. Perform scaling analysis with larger scene collections (20-50 scenes) to measure memory consumption and quality degradation
3. Evaluate on complex real-world captured scenes from datasets like Tanks and Temples or LLFF to assess robustness under realistic conditions
