# Exploring Knowledge Tracing in Tutor-Student Dialogues using LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16490
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Alexander Scarlatos; Ryan S. Baker; Andrew Lan
- Primary result: LLMKT significantly outperforms existing KT methods on two tutoring datasets, especially with limited training data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces dialogueKT, a novel task that extends knowledge tracing to analyze student discourse in tutoring dialogues. The authors propose LLMKT, a method that fine-tunes Llama 3 on dialogue text to predict knowledge mastery. Experiments on two tutoring datasets show that LLMKT significantly outperforms existing KT methods, particularly when training data is limited. The approach demonstrates that leveraging LLM's ability to process textual content improves student knowledge estimation in dialogue-based tutoring.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to knowledge tracing in tutoring dialogues by first annotating dialogues with GPT-4o to identify knowledge components and student response correctness, then applying KT methods to track knowledge over time. The core innovation is LLMKT, which fine-tunes the open-source Llama 3 LLM on dialogue text to predict student mastery. The method leverages the rich textual content in dialogues rather than relying solely on correctness and KC labels, allowing it to capture nuanced details about question difficulty and student responses that traditional KT methods miss.

## Key Results
- LLMKT significantly outperforms existing KT methods on both CoMTA and MathDial datasets
- Performance advantage is particularly pronounced with limited training data
- The method generalizes better across KCs due to its use of textual representations rather than learned embeddings
- Qualitative analysis shows the model accurately predicts knowledge states by leveraging dialogue context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMKT's advantage stems from leveraging the rich textual content in tutoring dialogues rather than relying solely on correctness and KC labels
- Mechanism: By fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on the textual content of tutor-student dialogues, LLMKT can capture nuanced details about the difficulty of questions and student responses that are not encoded in traditional KT methods
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM's language understanding capabilities can effectively translate dialogue context into meaningful knowledge state estimates
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "LLMKT significantly outperforms existing KT methods, especially with limited training data" and "leveraging LLM's ability to process textual content improves student knowledge estimation"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMKT generalizes better across KCs because it uses textual representations rather than learned embeddings
- Mechanism: Instead of learning separate embeddings for each KC from scratch, LLMKT uses the textual definitions of KCs and the dialogue context to estimate mastery, allowing it to handle KCs not seen during training
- Core assumption: The textual content of KC definitions and their context in dialogues contains sufficient information to distinguish between different KCs
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "LLMKT, that leverages the textual content in dialogues, by fine-tuning the open-source Llama 3 LLM on the KT objective"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMKT performs well with limited training data due to the pre-trained LLM's existing capabilities
- Mechanism: Starting with a powerful pre-trained LLM that already understands language and educational concepts allows LLMKT to achieve good performance without requiring large amounts of dialogue-specific training data
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM's general language understanding capabilities transfer effectively to the specific task of knowledge tracing in educational dialogues
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "LLMKT significantly outperforms existing KT methods, especially when little training data is available"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Tracing (KT)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds upon the KT framework by extending it to dialogue-based tutoring, so understanding the core KT concepts is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of knowledge tracing in educational settings?

- Concept: Common Core Math Standards
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these standards as knowledge components (KCs) for tagging dialogue turns, so understanding their structure and purpose is important
  - Quick check question: How are Common Core math standards organized hierarchically?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The paper's novel approach relies on fine-tuning LLMs for knowledge tracing, so understanding LLM capabilities and fine-tuning processes is crucial
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches when using LLMs for specific tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  GPT-4o for automated dialogue annotation -> Llama 3 LLM fine-tuning -> KT performance evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Annotate dialogue dataset with GPT-4o (correctness and KCs)
  2. Prepare training data by splitting into train/validation/test sets
  3. Fine-tune Llama 3 on the annotated data using binary cross-entropy loss
  4. Evaluate on test set using accuracy, AUC, and F1 metrics
  5. Conduct qualitative analysis of model predictions and knowledge change curves

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using GPT-4o for annotation provides high-quality labels but introduces API costs and potential privacy concerns
  - Fine-tuning Llama 3 requires significant computational resources but provides superior performance compared to smaller models
  - The dialogueKT task requires handling multiple KCs per turn, which complicates the architecture compared to standard KT

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on dialogues with many off-topic turns or emotional support interactions
  - Degradation when KCs are not well-represented in Common Core standards
  - Overfitting when training data is extremely limited (though this is mitigated by the pre-trained LLM)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate LLMKT on CoMTA dataset with 5-fold cross-validation
  2. Compare LLMKT performance against all baseline KT methods on both CoMTA and MathDial datasets
  3. Conduct qualitative analysis of model predictions on a sample dialogue to understand failure modes and strengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well do dialogueKT methods generalize to subjects beyond mathematics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "our work is restricted to math since analyzing the KCs in math problems is challenging yet well-studied; it remains to be seen whether our approach of Common Core standard tagging generalizes to other subjects."
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the approach on math tutoring datasets (CoMTA and MathDial), leaving uncertainty about performance in other domains like science, language learning, or programming.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can real-time knowledge tracing be implemented in dialogueKT without future context leakage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "by annotating a full dialogue with a single prompt, KT in real-time becomes impossible since information from future turns is available when annotating any given turn."
- Why unresolved: The current approach requires full dialogue context for annotation, making it unsuitable for real-time tutoring applications where immediate feedback is needed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do LLMKT predictions change with different training dataset sizes and dialogue lengths?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "dialogues can be relatively short, giving very little context for KT methods to leverage" and call for researchers with access to longer dialogues to test these methods.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments use datasets with short dialogues (4-5 turn pairs on average), leaving uncertainty about performance on longer, more informative conversations.

## Limitations

- Reliance on GPT-4o for automated annotation introduces potential biases and errors in ground truth labels
- Focus on math tutoring dialogues with Common Core standards limits generalizability to other subjects
- Computational cost of fine-tuning Llama 3 may limit practical deployment in resource-constrained settings

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core finding that LLMKT outperforms existing KT methods on both datasets, supported by consistent statistical improvements across multiple metrics and both datasets.

**Medium confidence** in the mechanism explanations, particularly regarding why LLMKT performs better with limited data and how it generalizes across KCs, as these rely on qualitative analysis rather than controlled ablation studies.

**Low confidence** in the practical deployment aspects, including real-world annotation costs, potential privacy concerns with GPT-4o API usage, and the computational requirements for fine-tuning large LLMs.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Conduct controlled experiments removing the dialogue context to isolate whether the LLM's language understanding capabilities or the dialogue structure itself drives performance improvements.

2. **Cross-domain generalization**: Test LLMKT on tutoring dialogues from different subjects (e.g., science, language learning) to validate claims about KC generalization beyond math and Common Core standards.

3. **Annotation quality validation**: Perform a systematic human evaluation of GPT-4o's correctness and KC annotations on a stratified sample of dialogues to quantify the error rate and identify systematic biases.
