# Beneath the Surface of Consistency: Exploring Cross-lingual Knowledge Representation Sharing in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.10646
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10646
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Cross-lingual knowledge consistency does not necessarily imply shared internal representations, with script similarity being a dominant factor in representation sharing.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how large language models represent factual knowledge across multiple languages, decoupling cross-lingual knowledge consistency (CKC) from representation sharing (CKR). Using a new multilingual dataset (CLIKE) and knowledge editing techniques, the authors find that script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing, with languages within the same script family exhibiting the highest degree of CKR. The research reveals that high consistency does not necessarily imply shared internal representations, especially for languages with different scripts, and quantifies that models could potentially more than triple their current cross-lingual average accuracy if knowledge were fully shared across languages.

## Method Summary
The study uses knowledge editing methods (ROME, MEMIT, and Finetuning) to modify factual knowledge in one language and examine effects on other languages, revealing representation sharing patterns. Researchers evaluated 7B-parameter decoder-only LLMs using a dataset of ~35k facts across 13 languages, measuring CKC and CKR using Exact Match (EM) metric. The methodology decouples consistency from representation by actively modifying model parameters rather than just evaluating outputs, allowing for direct measurement of shared knowledge representation across languages.

## Key Results
- High cross-lingual consistency does not necessarily imply shared internal representations, particularly for languages with different scripts
- Script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing, with languages within the same script family exhibiting the highest degree of CKR
- Cross-script knowledge transfer is limited but asymmetric, with stronger transfer from Cyrillic to Latin scripts than vice versa
- Models could potentially more than triple their current cross-lingual average accuracy if knowledge were fully shared across languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-lingual knowledge consistency (CKC) does not necessarily imply shared internal representation (CKR).
- Mechanism: Even when a model gives consistent correct answers in different languages, these answers can be generated from distinct, language-specific representations rather than a unified, language-agnostic abstraction.
- Core assumption: Measuring representation sharing requires active modification of the model's parameters and observing effects across languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We reveal that high consistency does not necessarily imply shared representation, particularly for languages with different scripts."
  - [section 2.2]: "Measuring the extent of shared knowledge representation across languages in LLMs cannot be done by merely evaluating model outputs."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors mention cross-lingual consistency but do not specifically address the decoupling of consistency from representation sharing.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing.
- Mechanism: Languages within the same script family exhibit higher degrees of CKR because tokenization and representation are more closely tied to script structure.
- Core assumption: Tokenization processes create language-specific embeddings that influence how knowledge is stored and retrieved.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, we find that script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing."
  - [section 4.3]: "We observe that the pairwise SR measure is relatively consistent across models, despite their varying language support. We find that languages within the same script family exhibit the highest degree of CKR across all models."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors discuss cross-lingual transfer but do not specifically address script similarity as a dominant factor.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge transfer between languages with different scripts is limited but asymmetric.
- Mechanism: Knowledge in Cyrillic script languages implies a higher probability of knowing the same facts in Latin script languages, but the reverse relation is weaker.
- Core assumption: The training data distribution and language dominance influence the strength of cross-script knowledge transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "We observe a higher degree of shared representation among Cyrillic languages compared to the shared representation between Cyrillic and Latin languages... Notably, we observe a script-based grouping in both CKC and CKR likely highlighting a tokenization induced bias."
  - [section 4.3]: "We hypothesize that the dominance of Latin script languages, especially English, in the training data leads to more robust fact representations in Latin scripts, facilitating easier transfer from Cyrillic to Latin than vice versa."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors do not specifically address asymmetric knowledge transfer between script families.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge editing methods (ROME, MEMIT, Finetuning)
  - Why needed here: To actively modify the model's stored factual knowledge and observe how changes propagate across languages, revealing representation sharing.
  - Quick check question: How do ROME and MEMIT differ in their approach to locating and modifying factual knowledge?

- Concept: Cross-lingual consistency vs. representation sharing
  - Why needed here: To understand that consistent answers do not necessarily mean the model uses the same internal representation across languages.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between CKC and CKR, and why can't we measure CKR by just evaluating model outputs?

- Concept: Script similarity and tokenization
  - Why needed here: To grasp how script structure influences tokenization and, consequently, how knowledge is represented and shared across languages.
  - Quick check question: How might tokenization induced by script structure affect cross-lingual knowledge representation sharing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CLIKE dataset -> 7B-parameter decoder-only LLMs (BLOOM-7B, Qwen, Llama-2, Mistral) -> Knowledge editing methods (ROME, MEMIT, Finetuning) -> CKC/CKR evaluation using EM metric

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare CLIKE dataset with paraphrased factual knowledge queries
  2. Apply knowledge editing methods to modify factual knowledge in one language
  3. Measure CKC and CKR across language pairs using EM metric
  4. Analyze the impact of script similarity on CKR

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using knowledge editing methods provides a more precise measure of representation sharing but may not capture all aspects of knowledge representation
  - Focusing on 7B-parameter models limits generalizability to larger or different architectures
  - Relying on specific editing methods may overlook other pathways for knowledge modification

- Failure signatures:
  - Low locality scores indicating edits negatively impact unrelated knowledge
  - Inconsistent results across different knowledge editing methods
  - Inability to observe meaningful differences in CKR across script families

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Measure CKC and CKR for a pair of closely related languages (e.g., Spanish and Italian) to establish a baseline
  2. Apply knowledge editing to a fact in Spanish and measure CKR in Italian to observe direct transfer
  3. Compare CKC and CKR for a pair of distantly related languages (e.g., English and Chinese) to highlight the impact of script differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the degree of script similarity between languages correlate with the degree of knowledge representation sharing in LLMs, and does this relationship hold across different model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that "languages within the same script family exhibit the highest degree of representation sharing" and observes that script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing across all models studied.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies script similarity as a key factor, it does not provide a quantitative measure of how script similarity correlates with knowledge representation sharing across different model architectures or training regimes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring the correlation between linguistic features of scripts (e.g., character sets, structural similarities) and knowledge sharing metrics across diverse LLM architectures, including encoder-decoder models and larger parameter models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can targeted architectural modifications or training strategies effectively improve cross-script knowledge representation sharing in LLMs without significantly compromising performance in high-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that if LLMs could fully share knowledge across languages, their accuracy could more than triple their current cross-lingual average. It also highlights the need for improved multilingual knowledge representation.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem and potential benefits of improved knowledge sharing but does not explore specific architectural or training interventions to achieve this goal.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating successful architectural modifications (e.g., shared cross-script embedding spaces) or training strategies (e.g., curriculum learning, adversarial training) that enhance cross-script knowledge sharing while maintaining or improving overall model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the language of the training data influence the cross-lingual knowledge representation patterns observed in LLMs, and how can this bias be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes an asymmetrical knowledge transfer pattern, with stronger transfer from Cyrillic to Latin scripts, which it attributes to the dominance of Latin script languages, especially English, in the training data.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests that training data language distribution may influence knowledge representation patterns, it does not quantify this relationship or explore methods to mitigate potential biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies analyzing the relationship between training data language distribution and cross-lingual knowledge sharing patterns, along with experiments testing various data balancing or augmentation strategies to reduce language bias in knowledge representation.

## Limitations
- Findings are limited to 7B-parameter decoder-only models and may not generalize to larger or different architectures
- Evaluation relies on a relatively small set of 20 facts per language pair for CKC and CKR measurement
- Study focuses on factual knowledge rather than broader semantic understanding, potentially missing other aspects of cross-lingual representation sharing

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** The decoupling of CKC from CKR is well-supported by the experimental methodology. The use of knowledge editing techniques provides direct evidence that consistent outputs do not imply shared representations. The observation that script similarity strongly influences representation sharing is robust across multiple models and language pairs.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim about asymmetric knowledge transfer between script families requires additional validation. While the hypothesis about Latin script dominance in training data is plausible, the evidence could be strengthened with more diverse language pairs and training data analysis. The quantification of potential accuracy improvements (3x+) is based on current limitations and assumes perfect cross-lingual sharing is achievable.

**Low Confidence:** The specific mechanism by which tokenization influences knowledge representation sharing is not fully elucidated. While script similarity correlates with CKR, the underlying reasons for this relationship remain somewhat speculative.

## Next Checks
1. **Scale Validation:** Replicate the CKC-CKR decoupling experiments across a wider range of model sizes (1B-70B parameters) to test the generalizability of findings across architectures.

2. **Dataset Expansion:** Increase the number of facts used for evaluation from 20 to 100+ per language pair to ensure statistical robustness and capture more nuanced patterns in representation sharing.

3. **Tokenization Analysis:** Conduct controlled experiments varying tokenization strategies while keeping model architecture constant to isolate the impact of tokenization on cross-lingual representation sharing.
