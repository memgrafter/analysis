# Beyond Model Interpretability: Socio-Structural Explanations in Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03632
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03632
- Reference count: 40
- This paper argues for extending ML interpretability beyond model-centric explanations to include socio-structural explanations that account for how social structures shape ML outputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes that machine learning interpretability should extend beyond technical model explanations to incorporate socio-structural analysis, particularly in normatively salient domains. The authors argue that ML models are embedded within and shaped by social structures, making it necessary to analyze broader societal context to understand model behavior and address algorithmic bias. Using a case study of a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm, they demonstrate how structural racism in healthcare access and quality leads to systematic discrimination against Black patients, showing that traditional interpretability methods alone are insufficient for understanding and addressing such biases.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a case study approach using the Obermeyer et al. (2019) analysis of a healthcare allocation algorithm that discriminated against Black patients. The method involves analyzing how the algorithm used healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs, then supplementing this technical analysis with socio-structural examination of historical patterns of racial disparities in healthcare access and quality. This combined approach reveals how structural racism, rather than just technical model choices, drives algorithmic bias.

## Key Results
- Socio-structural explanations reveal that algorithmic bias stems from broader societal patterns rather than just technical model choices
- In high-stakes domains, understanding ML outputs requires analyzing how social structures shape both data generation and model behavior
- Effective interventions for algorithmic bias must address root structural causes rather than only technical symptoms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Socio-structural explanations provide causal understanding of model behavior by linking algorithmic outputs to broader societal patterns.
- Mechanism: When ML models operate within complex social systems, their predictions are shaped by historical inequalities, institutional practices, and power dynamics. By incorporating these structural factors into explanations, we can identify the true causal mechanisms behind biased or unexpected model behavior.
- Core assumption: Social structures have measurable impacts on data generation and model behavior that cannot be captured by purely technical interpretability methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures"
  - [section] "The grading structure, in this case, serves as a crucial contextual element shaping the explanation"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence shows related work on user-centered explanations and interpretability frameworks, but no direct evidence for socio-structural mechanisms.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Socio-structural explanations enable more effective interventions than model-centric approaches alone.
- Mechanism: By understanding how social structures influence model behavior, practitioners can design interventions that address root causes rather than symptoms. This leads to more sustainable solutions for algorithmic bias and unfairness.
- Core assumption: Understanding structural causes enables more effective solutions than addressing only technical symptoms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself"
  - [section] "Producing rigorous socio-structural explanations can be challenging as it requires significant sociological understanding and interdisciplinary expertise"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - related papers focus on general explanation frameworks rather than structural interventions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Socio-structural explanations improve transparency demands in high-stakes domains.
- Mechanism: In domains with significant societal impact, transparency requirements must extend beyond technical details to include understanding of how social structures shape model behavior and outcomes. This broader transparency enables better accountability and governance.
- Core assumption: High-stakes domains require transparency that accounts for both technical and social factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself"
  - [section] "In high-stake decision domains, a socio-structural analysis could be necessary to understand system outputs, uncover societal biases, ensure accountability, and guide policy decisions"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific claim about transparency demands.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Social structures and their impact on data generation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how institutions, policies, and cultural norms shape the data that ML models learn from is crucial for interpreting model behavior in social contexts.
  - Quick check question: How might historical housing discrimination patterns affect mortgage approval prediction models?

- Concept: Interpretability techniques and their limitations
  - Why needed here: Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of different interpretability approaches helps practitioners choose appropriate methods for different contexts and understand when additional socio-structural analysis is needed.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between local and global interpretability methods, and when might each be appropriate?

- Concept: Interdisciplinary collaboration frameworks
  - Why needed here: Effectively incorporating socio-structural explanations requires collaboration between ML practitioners and social scientists, requiring frameworks for communication and joint problem-solving.
  - Quick check question: What are effective ways to structure collaboration between ML engineers and sociologists when investigating algorithmic bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Socio-structural analysis tools -> Integration mechanisms -> Intervention planning tools -> Policy guidance
- Critical path: Identify relevant social structures → Analyze impact on model behavior → Integrate with technical explanations → Design interventions → Guide policy decisions
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing depth of social analysis with practical constraints, choosing between automated structural analysis tools versus expert consultation, and deciding how much social context to include in explanations for different stakeholder groups
- Failure signatures: Explanations that ignore relevant social factors, overemphasis on technical details while missing structural causes, inability to translate structural insights into actionable interventions, and resistance from stakeholders who prefer purely technical explanations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the framework to a loan approval model, analyzing how historical redlining affects current predictions
  2. Test different integration methods for combining technical feature importance with structural factor analysis
  3. Evaluate the effectiveness of structural interventions versus purely technical ones in addressing algorithmic bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively integrate socio-structural expertise into the ML development lifecycle, given current constraints in time, training, and resources?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that many ML practitioners may not feel adequately equipped to analyze social structures and are hindered by constraints in time, training, incentives, or resources.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the challenge but doesn't provide specific solutions for how to bridge this gap between technical and socio-structural expertise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing successful integration models, case studies of ML teams effectively incorporating socio-structural analysis, and frameworks for cross-disciplinary collaboration in ML development.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks could be developed to assess the legal and ethical relevance of different interpretability methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states there is a lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to assess interpretability methods' legal and ethical relevance and compare their performance.
- Why unresolved: Despite the growing number of interpretability approaches, the field lacks unified metrics for evaluating their effectiveness in real-world, high-stakes applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of comprehensive evaluation suites that test interpretability methods across multiple dimensions (e.g., legal compliance, ethical considerations, robustness to dataset shift), and empirical validation showing these benchmarks predict real-world performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design ML systems that are not only technically proficient but also socially aware and beneficially aligned, while maintaining model performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes by calling for further research into integrating socio-structural understanding into different stages of the ML lifecycle, suggesting this as a way to develop systems that are socially aware and beneficially aligned.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes the need for socio-structural explanations but doesn't provide a concrete methodology for balancing technical proficiency with social awareness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of ML systems that successfully incorporate socio-structural factors without compromising performance, and quantitative analyses showing the impact of socio-structural considerations on model outcomes and societal impact.

## Limitations
- The paper relies heavily on a single case study (healthcare allocation) rather than multiple domains
- Limited discussion of practical implementation challenges and resource requirements
- Insufficient evidence for how socio-structural explanations translate into concrete policy or technical interventions
- No evaluation of stakeholder reception or usability of socio-structural explanations

## Confidence
- High: The core argument that social structures influence ML outputs and that purely technical explanations are insufficient in normatively salient domains
- Medium: The specific mechanisms proposed for how socio-structural explanations enable better interventions and governance
- Low: The feasibility of implementing systematic socio-structural analysis at scale, given the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across 3-5 diverse high-stakes domains (e.g., criminal justice, education, employment) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct user studies with ML practitioners and affected communities to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of socio-structural explanations
3. Develop and pilot specific tools for automating aspects of socio-structural analysis to address scalability concerns
