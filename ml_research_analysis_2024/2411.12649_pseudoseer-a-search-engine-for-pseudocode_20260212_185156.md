# PseudoSeer: a Search Engine for Pseudocode

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.12649
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12649
- Reference count: 3
- PseudoSeer is a specialized search engine for retrieving pseudocode from academic papers using Elasticsearch.

## Executive Summary
PseudoSeer is a specialized search engine designed to retrieve pseudocode from academic papers. Built on Elasticsearch, it enables searching across multiple facets including title, abstract, author information, and LaTeX code snippets. The system leverages a dataset of 320,000 pseudocode examples extracted from arXiv papers and implements a weighted BM25-based ranking algorithm to prioritize relevant results. The search interface provides a user-friendly experience similar to conventional search engines while offering specialized functionality for code-centric literature exploration.

## Method Summary
The system uses Elasticsearch with Unicode text segmentation for tokenization, dual-layered indexing (LaTeX code and cleaned references), and weighted BM25 ranking with field-specific weights (title/abstract = 2, LaTeX/author = 1). The dataset consists of 320,000 pseudocode examples extracted from arXiv papers using \begin{algorithm} and \end{algorithm} tags. The search interface supports single-field, combined-field, and exact-match queries.

## Key Results
- Enables efficient retrieval of pseudocode with facet-based search across multiple fields
- Implements weighted BM25 ranking to prioritize search results based on field relevance
- Preserves LaTeX structure in pseudocode indexing while maintaining semantic meaning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BM25 ranking with field-specific weights prioritizes search results based on field relevance
- Mechanism: The system assigns weights of 2 to title and abstract fields, and 1 to LaTeX code and author fields. During multi-field searches, these weights are multiplied with BM25 scores to calculate a final relevance score for each document
- Core assumption: Title and abstract fields contain more relevant information for search queries than LaTeX code and author fields
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In multi-field searches, the search engine assigns predetermined weights to each field. These weights are then incorporated into the BM25 algorithm to calculate the weighted scores. The weights are chosen based on the potential relevance of the fields in real-world use cases."
  - [section] "To that end, the weights for the LaTeX pseudocode and authors fields are set to one, while the weights for other fields are set to two."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Preserving LaTeX structure in pseudocode indexing maintains semantic meaning while enabling search
- Mechanism: Instead of converting LaTeX pseudocode to plain text, the system indexes LaTeX commands like "\for" and "\If" as searchable terms, preserving the algorithmic structure and enabling queries to match specific code constructs
- Core assumption: LaTeX commands carry semantic meaning that is important for understanding and searching pseudocode
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In our search engine, we retain the LaTeX code itself for indexing, treating it as regular text while keeping important commands intact to preserve the structural cues within the pseudocode."
  - [section] "This allows us to capture specific elements like '\for' loops and '\If' conditions directly, without breaking down the LaTeX into plain text and risking a loss of context and structure"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dual-layered indexing (code + reference context) enables both structural and thematic searches
- Mechanism: The system indexes both the raw LaTeX pseudocode and cleaned reference text surrounding each code snippet, allowing users to search using either code-specific syntax or broader thematic keywords
- Core assumption: Users have different search preferences - some want to search by exact code syntax, others prefer thematic keywords
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We also index the references surrounding each pseudocode snippet to enable keyword-based searches within the pseudocode's descriptive context, while avoiding complex LaTeX syntax."
  - [section] "This dual-layered indexing is particularly useful for users who may not know or prefer not to use the exact code syntax, as it allows them to locate pseudocode based on broader thematic keywords and descriptions found in the surrounding text"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: BM25 ranking algorithm
  - Why needed here: Provides a sophisticated scoring mechanism that balances term frequency with document length normalization and saturation effects, producing more relevant search results than simple TF-IDF
  - Quick check question: How does BM25 prevent overly frequent terms from dominating search scores compared to traditional TF-IDF?

- Concept: Elasticsearch indexing and search architecture
  - Why needed here: Provides the scalable search infrastructure needed to handle millions of pseudocode snippets and support complex multi-field searches with weighted ranking
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of Elasticsearch that make it suitable for this pseudocode search application?

- Concept: LaTeX parsing and tokenization
  - Why needed here: Required to properly handle pseudocode that uses LaTeX formatting while preserving semantic meaning for search purposes
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when trying to tokenize LaTeX code that contains both text and formatting commands?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion pipeline -> Elasticsearch cluster -> Web interface -> Ranking engine -> Reference extraction module
- Critical path: User query -> Elasticsearch search across specified fields -> BM25 scoring with weights -> result sorting -> web display with highlighting
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Storing LaTeX code vs. plain text: Preserves semantic meaning but increases storage and complexity
  - Dual-layer indexing: Provides flexibility but doubles storage requirements and indexing complexity
  - Fixed weights vs. dynamic weights: Simpler implementation but may not adapt to all query types
  - Elasticsearch vs. custom search: Leverages proven technology but may have less control over ranking
- Failure signatures:
  - No results returned: Could indicate indexing issues, query parsing problems, or empty dataset
  - Poor relevance ranking: May indicate incorrect weight assignments or BM25 parameter issues
  - Slow search response: Could indicate insufficient Elasticsearch resources or inefficient queries
  - Inconsistent highlighting: May indicate field mapping issues or text processing inconsistencies
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test single-field search with exact match query to verify basic search functionality
  2. Test multi-field search with different weight configurations to evaluate ranking effectiveness
  3. Test reference extraction and indexing to ensure dual-layer search capability works correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can the search engine's ranking algorithm be improved to better handle multi-field searches where relevance varies significantly across fields?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using predetermined weights (2 for title/abstract, 1 for LaTeX/author) in BM25 for multi-field searches, but acknowledges this could be improved with dynamic adaptation.
  - Why unresolved: The current weighting system uses static values that may not accurately reflect the true relevance of fields for different query types, and the paper explicitly suggests dynamic adaptation as future work.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation results showing improved precision/recall metrics when using adaptive ranking algorithms versus static weighting across diverse query types.

- Question: What is the impact of retaining LaTeX syntax in pseudocode indexing versus converting to plain text on search accuracy and user experience?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the tradeoff between preserving LaTeX structure for search accuracy and the complexity it adds, noting that retaining commands like "\for" and "\If" maintains context but requires more storage.
  - Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a design choice without providing empirical evidence of its effectiveness or user impact.
  - What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing search satisfaction and precision metrics between the current LaTeX-retaining approach versus plain text conversion across various pseudocode search scenarios.

- Question: How can the dataset be expanded beyond papers containing \begin{algorithm} and \end{algorithm} tags to include more diverse pseudocode examples?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states the current dataset is limited to papers with specific LaTeX tags and suggests machine learning-based solutions for detecting additional pseudocode patterns as future work.
  - Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a limitation but does not implement or evaluate any alternative extraction methods.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics showing improved search coverage and recall after implementing ML-based pseudocode detection across papers with varied formatting styles and tag usage.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks evaluation metrics demonstrating PseudoSeer's effectiveness compared to baseline search methods
- No user studies or quantitative performance measures are provided to validate the weighted BM25 approach
- The dataset preprocessing pipeline, particularly the reference extraction mechanism, is not fully specified

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core architecture using Elasticsearch with multi-field indexing and BM25 ranking is technically sound and well-established
- Medium Confidence: The weighted BM25 approach with field-specific weights should improve relevance ranking, though optimal weight values are uncertain
- Low Confidence: The effectiveness of preserving LaTeX commands for semantic search and the benefits of dual-layer indexing are not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing PseudoSeer's retrieval accuracy against a baseline search engine using standard IR metrics like precision@k and MAP
2. Perform user studies to evaluate whether the field weight assignments actually improve search relevance for typical use cases
3. Test the system's scalability and performance with larger datasets to verify Elasticsearch configuration handles real-world query loads effectively
