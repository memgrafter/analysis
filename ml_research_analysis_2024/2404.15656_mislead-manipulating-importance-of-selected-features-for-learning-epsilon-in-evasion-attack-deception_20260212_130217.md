# MISLEAD: Manipulating Importance of Selected features for Learning Epsilon in Evasion Attack Deception

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.15656
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15656
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Novel SHAP-based evasion attack with optimal epsilon technique achieving high efficacy on tabular datasets

## Executive Summary
MISLEAD introduces a novel evasion attack methodology that combines SHAP-based feature importance analysis with an Optimal Epsilon technique. The approach identifies the most influential features for model predictions and systematically modifies them to shift classifications to target classes while minimizing perturbation. Experiments demonstrate MISLEAD's effectiveness across diverse ML architectures, outperforming baseline attacks like FGM and PGD in black-box settings.

## Method Summary
MISLEAD operates by first analyzing feature importance using SHAP values to identify which features most influence model predictions. These features are categorized based on their impact direction (increasing or decreasing probability of target class). An evasion attack strategy then modifies these identified features, guided by a conversion table that maps feature values to their effects on predictions. The Optimal Epsilon technique employs binary search to determine the minimum perturbation magnitude required for successful evasion, ensuring adversarial samples remain minimally altered while effectively deceiving the model.

## Key Results
- MISLEAD achieves high efficacy in targeted attacks on Iris and Bank Marketing datasets
- The method outperforms baseline attacks (FGM, PGD) in black-box settings
- Binary search efficiently determines minimal epsilon values for successful evasion
- Works across diverse ML architectures without requiring internal model access

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SHAP values allow the model to prioritize the most influential features for perturbation in evasion attacks.
- Mechanism: SHAP values quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction, enabling the identification of features that have the strongest impact on classification. By targeting these features for modification, the attack can efficiently shift the model's prediction to the desired target class with minimal perturbation.
- Core assumption: SHAP values accurately reflect feature importance and are reliable indicators of which features to modify for successful evasion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach begins with SHAP-based analysis to understand model vulnerabilities, crucial for devising targeted evasion strategies."
  - [section] "SHAP values quantify the influence of each feature on model predictions, providing insights into the direction and magnitude of their impact."
  - [corpus] "Weak evidence - The corpus contains papers on adversarial attacks but does not specifically discuss the use of SHAP values for feature prioritization in evasion attacks."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Optimal Epsilon technique ensures the generation of adversarial samples with minimal perturbation.
- Mechanism: The Optimal Epsilon technique employs a binary search algorithm to systematically determine the smallest epsilon value required for successful evasion. By iteratively narrowing down the epsilon range, the technique ensures that the generated adversarial samples have the minimal perturbation necessary to deceive the model.
- Core assumption: The binary search algorithm can efficiently find the optimal epsilon value within a reasonable number of iterations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Optimal Epsilon technique, employing a Binary Search algorithm, efficiently determines the minimum epsilon needed for successful evasion."
  - [section] "This technique systematically determines the smallest epsilon (ϵoptimal) necessary for successful evasion by employing a binary search loop, refer to Algorithm 2 in Appendix B."
  - [corpus] "Weak evidence - The corpus contains papers on adversarial attacks but does not specifically discuss the use of a binary search algorithm for determining the optimal epsilon value in evasion attacks."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The black-box setting of MISLEAD makes it applicable to real-world scenarios where attackers may not have access to the model's internal parameters.
- Mechanism: MISLEAD operates solely based on the model's output predictions, without requiring knowledge of the model's internal parameters or architecture. This allows the attack to be performed in a black-box setting, making it more realistic and applicable to real-world scenarios where attackers may not have full access to the target model.
- Core assumption: The model's output predictions provide sufficient information for the attack to be successful in a black-box setting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MISLEAD operates in a black-box setting, relying solely on the model’s predictions, making it applicable to real-world scenarios where attackers might not have access to the model’s internal parameters."
  - [section] "Our attack strategy operates in a complete black-box setting, where the attacker can only query the target model for predictions without insight into internal parameters and weights."
  - [corpus] "Weak evidence - The corpus contains papers on adversarial attacks but does not specifically discuss the use of a black-box setting for evasion attacks."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
  - Why needed here: SHAP values are used to quantify the influence of each feature on the model's predictions, enabling the identification of the most important features for perturbation in evasion attacks.
  - Quick check question: How do SHAP values help in understanding the impact of individual features on a model's predictions?

- Concept: Binary Search Algorithm
  - Why needed here: The binary search algorithm is employed in the Optimal Epsilon technique to efficiently find the smallest epsilon value required for successful evasion by iteratively narrowing down the epsilon range.
  - Quick check question: How does the binary search algorithm work in the context of finding the optimal epsilon value for evasion attacks?

- Concept: Black-Box Attack
  - Why needed here: MISLEAD operates in a black-box setting, relying solely on the model's output predictions without requiring access to the model's internal parameters. This makes the attack more applicable to real-world scenarios.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of performing an evasion attack in a black-box setting compared to a white-box setting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SHAP-based Feature Importance Analysis -> Feature Impact Categorization -> Conversion Table Generation -> Evasion Attack Strategy -> Optimal Epsilon Technique

- Critical path: The critical path for successful evasion attacks involves performing SHAP-based feature importance analysis, categorizing feature impacts, generating a conversion table, executing the evasion attack strategy, and employing the Optimal Epsilon technique to minimize perturbation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Efficiency: Balancing the accuracy of feature importance analysis using SHAP values with the computational efficiency of the attack strategy.
  - Perturbation Magnitude vs. Attack Success: Determining the optimal epsilon value that allows for successful evasion while minimizing the magnitude of perturbation applied to the input features.

- Failure signatures:
  - Ineffective Feature Prioritization: If the SHAP-based feature importance analysis fails to accurately identify the most influential features, the attack may not efficiently shift the model's prediction to the desired target class.
  - Suboptimal Epsilon Value: If the Optimal Epsilon technique fails to find the optimal epsilon value within a reasonable number of iterations, the attack may generate adversarial samples with excessive perturbation or fail to deceive the model.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the efficacy of MISLEAD on a simple binary classification dataset, such as the Iris dataset, and compare the results with existing attack methods like FGM and PGD.
  2. Assess the impact of varying epsilon values on the success rate of evasion attacks and the magnitude of perturbation required for successful evasion.
  3. Analyze the performance of MISLEAD in a black-box setting by evaluating its efficacy on a target model without access to the model's internal parameters or architecture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MISLEAD's black-box attack performance compare to white-box attacks on the same models when given the same perturbation budget?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly notes that FGM and PGD are white-box attacks while MISLEAD is black-box, and suggests this distinction adds a critical layer to the comparative analysis
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides qualitative comparisons suggesting MISLEAD's efficacy under limited information is significant, but doesn't directly compare black-box vs white-box performance on identical models with equal perturbation budgets
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing MISLEAD's efficacy against white-box attacks (FGM/PGD) on the same models with identical epsilon values and target classes

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of SHAP explanation method (TreeSHAP vs KernelSHAP vs DeepSHAP) affect MISLEAD's attack efficacy across different model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses SHAP values but doesn't specify which SHAP implementation is used, and different SHAP methods can produce different feature importance rankings that would directly impact the attack strategy
- Why unresolved: Different SHAP implementations have varying computational properties and accuracy trade-offs that could significantly affect the quality of feature importance analysis and thus attack success rates
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments running MISLEAD with different SHAP implementations across various model types (tree-based, neural networks, linear models) while measuring attack efficacy

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between feature correlation structure and MISLEAD's attack success rate?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper analyzes individual feature impacts but doesn't examine how correlated features affect the attack, and the conversion rules might not account for feature dependencies
- Why unresolved: Real-world datasets often have correlated features, and modifying one feature might be less effective if correlated features aren't also adjusted, potentially limiting attack success
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets with varying correlation structures (independent, moderately correlated, highly correlated features) while measuring attack success and perturbation efficiency

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope on tabular datasets may not generalize to high-dimensional data like images or text
- Missing specific implementation details for thresholds and tolerance values that significantly affect attack performance
- Potential computational complexity for complex models or datasets with subtle decision boundaries

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims**:
- SHAP values effectively quantify feature contributions to model predictions
- Binary search algorithm can find optimal epsilon values
- Black-box setting provides practical advantages for real-world attacks

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- MISLEAD outperforms FGM and PGD baselines
- Optimal Epsilon technique consistently finds minimal perturbations

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Generalizability across diverse ML architectures
- Real-world applicability without model access

## Next Checks
1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary Tlow and Thigh values to determine their impact on attack success rates and perturbation magnitude. Document how different threshold choices affect the conversion table generation and subsequent attack effectiveness.

2. **Dataset Diversity Testing**: Evaluate MISLEAD on high-dimensional datasets (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) to assess scalability and identify any performance degradation. Compare results with low-dimensional tabular datasets to understand data modality impacts.

3. **Binary Search Convergence Validation**: Measure the average number of iterations required for optimal epsilon determination across different attack scenarios. Test convergence behavior with varying tolerance values and document cases where binary search fails or requires excessive iterations.
