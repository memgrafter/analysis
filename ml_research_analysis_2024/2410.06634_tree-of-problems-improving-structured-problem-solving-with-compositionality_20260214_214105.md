core_contribution: This paper introduces Tree of Problems (ToP), a structured approach
  for solving complex reasoning tasks by recursively decomposing them into simpler,
  analogous subproblems organized in a tree. Unlike existing methods like Tree of
  Thoughts or Graph of Thoughts, ToP uses a simpler bottom-up framework where atomic
  problems are solved first and their solutions are merged recursively to solve parent
  problems.

# Tree of Problems: Improving structured problem solving with compositionality
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.06634
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06634
- Reference count: 21
- Tree of Problems (ToP) outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods like CoT, ToT, and GoT on sorting, set intersection, and keyword counting tasks, and improves reasoning accuracy on BIG-Bench Hard.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Tree of Problems (ToP), a structured approach for solving complex reasoning tasks by recursively decomposing them into simpler, analogous subproblems organized in a tree. Unlike existing methods like Tree of Thoughts or Graph of Thoughts, ToP uses a simpler bottom-up framework where atomic problems are solved first and their solutions are merged recursively to solve parent problems. Experiments show that ToP outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods such as CoT, ToT, and GoT on tasks like sorting, set intersection, and keyword counting, and improves reasoning accuracy on benchmark tasks like BIG-Bench Hard. The method demonstrates scalability across model sizes and robustness to variations in subproblem-solving prompts.

## Method Summary
Tree of Problems (ToP) is a structured problem-solving framework that recursively decomposes complex reasoning tasks into simpler, analogous subproblems organized in a tree structure. The method follows a bottom-up approach: atomic problems are solved first, and their solutions are merged recursively to solve parent problems. This contrasts with existing methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT) and Graph of Thoughts (GoT), which explore solution paths more expansively. ToP leverages the compositionality of reasoning tasks, enabling systematic decomposition and solution merging. The approach is implemented using language models and is evaluated across multiple tasks, including sorting, set intersection, and keyword counting, as well as on BIG-Bench Hard to assess general reasoning improvement.

## Key Results
- ToP outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), and Graph of Thoughts (GoT) on sorting, set intersection, and keyword counting tasks.
- ToP improves reasoning accuracy on BIG-Bench Hard, a benchmark for complex reasoning.
- The method demonstrates scalability across model sizes and robustness to variations in subproblem-solving prompts.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ToP works by leveraging the inherent structure of reasoning tasks and decomposing them into smaller, solvable subproblems. The bottom-up approach ensures that solutions to atomic problems are built upon and merged to address increasingly complex parent problems. This compositional structure allows the model to focus on manageable subproblems rather than being overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire task. By recursively merging solutions, ToP exploits the compositional nature of reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency compared to methods that do not decompose tasks systematically.

## Foundational Learning
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into simpler subproblems is essential for managing reasoning complexity. *Why needed*: Enables systematic and manageable problem solving. *Quick check*: Verify that each subproblem is solvable by the model and analogous to others.
- **Bottom-up Solution Merging**: Combining solutions from atomic problems to solve parent problems. *Why needed*: Ensures solutions are built incrementally and compositionally. *Quick check*: Confirm that merged solutions are logically consistent and address the parent problem.
- **Tree Structure for Reasoning**: Organizing subproblems in a tree allows for clear parent-child relationships and systematic exploration. *Why needed*: Provides a structured framework for decomposition and solution merging. *Quick check*: Validate that the tree captures all necessary subproblems and their relationships.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Problem Decomposition -> Atomic Problem Solving -> Solution Merging -> Parent Problem Solving
- **Critical Path**: Atomic problems are solved first, then their solutions are merged recursively to solve parent problems, culminating in the solution to the original complex problem.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: ToP favors simplicity and systematic decomposition over the exploratory breadth of methods like ToT and GoT, trading off some solution diversity for structured accuracy.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor decomposition leading to unsolvable subproblems, inconsistent solution merging, or incorrect parent problem resolution.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Validate atomic problem solving accuracy. 2) Test solution merging for simple parent problems. 3) Evaluate full ToP pipeline on a benchmark task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to specific synthetic and semi-synthetic reasoning tasks, raising questions about generalizability to real-world problems.
- Limited ablation studies on the impact of different decomposition strategies and sensitivity to subproblem identification quality.
- Computational overhead of the recursive bottom-up process is not thoroughly analyzed, leaving scalability questions for large problem spaces.

## Confidence
- **Core methodology and experimental results**: High
- **Generalizability and robustness across domains**: Medium
- **Efficiency and resource requirements for large-scale applications**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to determine the sensitivity of ToP's performance to different subproblem decomposition strategies and prompt variations.
2. Evaluate ToP on a broader set of real-world reasoning tasks, including open-ended problems and domains outside the current benchmark scope, to assess generalizability.
3. Analyze and report the computational overhead and resource usage of the recursive bottom-up process, especially for large problem instances, to understand scalability constraints.
