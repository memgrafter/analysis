# ContextGS: Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting with Anchor Level Context Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.20721
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20721
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Over 100x size reduction compared to vanilla 3DGS, 15x compared to Scaffold-GS, with comparable or higher rendering quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficient storage and compression for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models, which require significant storage due to numerous Gaussians and their attributes. The authors propose ContextGS, a novel framework that introduces an autoregressive context model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression. By dividing anchors into hierarchical levels and encoding them progressively while leveraging spatial dependencies, ContextGS achieves substantial compression gains. Additionally, the use of low-dimensional quantized hyperprior features further improves entropy coding efficiency, resulting in impressive storage savings while maintaining or improving rendering quality.

## Method Summary
ContextGS introduces a multi-level anchor division strategy where anchors are partitioned into hierarchical levels based on voxel sizes. The framework employs autoregressive context modeling, where anchors at coarser levels are encoded first and used to predict distributions of nearby anchors at finer levels. A quantized hyperprior feature is introduced for each anchor to provide additional prior information beyond spatial position. During encoding, anchors are processed level by level (coarsest to finest), with each anchor's attributes encoded using entropy coding based on hyperprior features and context from already decoded anchors. The anchor forward technique allows reusing decoded anchors from coarser levels in the finest level, reducing storage overhead.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 100x size reduction compared to vanilla 3DGS
- Achieves 15x size reduction compared to state-of-the-art Scaffold-GS
- Maintains comparable or higher rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) on real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical anchor division reduces spatial redundancy by enabling autoregressive context modeling. Anchors are divided into K disjoint levels, where anchors at coarser levels are encoded first and used to predict the distribution of nearby anchors at finer levels. This leverages spatial dependencies among adjacent anchors, leading to more accurate entropy modeling and higher coding efficiency.

### Mechanism 2
Hyperprior features provide additional prior information for anchor attributes, improving entropy coding efficiency. A low-dimensional quantized feature is introduced for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed and used to predict anchor properties. This provides more flexibility than just using positional information for context modeling.

### Mechanism 3
Anchor forward technique reuses anchors from coarser levels, avoiding redundant storage. Decoded anchors from coarser levels are directly forwarded to finer levels rather than being stored separately. This reduces storage overhead while maintaining the autoregressive context modeling benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)**: The base representation that needs compression. Understanding how 3DGS represents scenes with learnable Gaussian primitives is essential.
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on 3DGS as the base representation that needs compression
  - Quick check question: What are the learnable attributes of each 3D Gaussian in 3DGS?

- **Entropy coding and context models**: The compression technique relies on entropy coding with context modeling to reduce storage.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how context models predict symbol distributions is crucial for the compression technique
  - Quick check question: How does a context model improve compression efficiency compared to coding symbols independently?

- **Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques**: The anchor division strategy resembles LOD approaches but with the novel twist of reusing anchors across levels.
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional LOD helps appreciate the innovation in the anchor division approach
  - Quick check question: What is the typical approach in LOD techniques for handling representations at different levels?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Anchor partitioning -> Context modeling -> Hyperprior encoding -> Entropy coding -> Rendering pipeline
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Initialize anchors from 3DGS model
  2. Divide anchors into levels based on voxel size
  3. Encode anchors level by level (coarsest to finest)
  4. For each anchor, use hyperprior + context from already decoded anchors to predict distribution
  5. Encode anchor attributes using entropy coding
  6. During decoding, reverse the process

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - More levels provide better context modeling but increase encoding complexity
  - Larger hyperprior features improve prediction accuracy but reduce compression gains
  - Fixed quantization width preserves precision but may use more bits than adaptive approaches

- **Failure signatures**:
  - PSNR drops significantly when anchor forward is disabled
  - Storage savings diminish if hyperprior features are too large
  - Encoding/decoding time increases if autoregressive context modeling is too fine-grained

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare PSNR and size with/without anchor-level context model on a small scene
  2. Evaluate impact of different target ratios τ between adjacent levels
  3. Test encoding anchor positions with hyperprior vs. fixed quantization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the choice of target ratio τ among adjacent levels affect the tradeoff between rendering quality and compression ratio in ContextGS? The paper only explores one specific value of τ = 0.2 and mentions that the performance of models among different scenes is relatively robust to the selection of τ, but a comprehensive analysis of how different τ values impact the rate-distortion tradeoff across various datasets is not provided.

### Open Question 2
How does the proposed anchor-level context model in ContextGS compare to other context modeling approaches in terms of coding efficiency and rendering quality? While the authors show that their anchor-level context model outperforms the baseline Scaffold-GS model, it is unclear how it compares to other context modeling techniques specifically.

### Open Question 3
What is the impact of the anchor forward technique on the overall compression performance and rendering quality of ContextGS? While the authors demonstrate its effectiveness, the specific impact of this technique on different aspects of the model (e.g., coding efficiency, rendering speed, visual fidelity) is not thoroughly analyzed.

## Limitations
- The spatial redundancy assumption underlying the autoregressive context model may not hold uniformly across all scenes, particularly those with sparse or non-uniform anchor distributions
- Computational overhead of the multi-level anchor division and autoregressive context modeling during encoding could be substantial, though encoding times are not reported
- The hyperprior feature design uses fixed quantization width without adaptive strategies, which may not be optimal for all anchor attribute distributions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core claim that ContextGS achieves 100x size reduction compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15x compared to Scaffold-GS is well-supported by the experimental results shown in Table 1. The rendering quality preservation is also well-demonstrated.

- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism of anchor-level autoregressive context modeling is theoretically sound and shows effectiveness in ablation studies, but the specific implementation details and their impact on different scene types are not fully explored.

- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of the hyperprior features for improving entropy coding efficiency is claimed but not thoroughly validated. The paper mentions their use but provides limited ablation studies on their impact.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on hyperprior feature dimensions**: Systematically evaluate the impact of different hyperprior feature sizes (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit) on both compression ratio and rendering quality to determine the optimal tradeoff.

2. **Performance on sparse scenes**: Test ContextGS on scenes with sparse or non-uniform anchor distributions (such as outdoor scenes or scenes with large empty spaces) to validate the spatial redundancy assumption across diverse scenarios.

3. **Encoding time analysis**: Measure and report the encoding time for ContextGS compared to Scaffold-GS and vanilla 3DGS to quantify the computational overhead of the multi-level anchor division and autoregressive context modeling approach.
