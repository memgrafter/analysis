# TractoEmbed: Modular Multi-level Embedding framework for white matter tract segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.08187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08187
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Modular multi-level embedding framework achieves state-of-the-art white matter tract segmentation with 93.04% accuracy and 91.38% F1-score

## Executive Summary
TractoEmbed addresses the challenging problem of white matter tract segmentation in diffusion MRI data by introducing a modular multi-level embedding framework. The method tackles key issues including class imbalance between major and minor tracts, structural similarity, subject variability, and symmetric streamlines between hemispheres. By encoding localized representations through learning tasks in respective encoders at streamline, cluster, and patch levels, TractoEmbed captures maximum spatial information while maintaining flexibility for future extensions.

## Method Summary
TractoEmbed employs a hierarchical approach to white matter tract segmentation using three distinct data representations: Streamline Data (15,3 dimensional), Local Point Cloud Data (sampled from k local streamlines), and Hyperlocal Point Cloud Data (sampled from 5 nearest streamlines using FSS). The framework consists of three encoders - Streamline Encoder (CNN-based), Cluster Encoder (PointNet), and Patch Encoder (dVAE) - that generate embeddings at different levels of abstraction. These embeddings are concatenated and fed to a classifier MLP trained with Focal Loss to handle class imbalance. The modular design allows independent training of components and easy integration of additional embeddings in future work.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improves from 91.85% to 93.04% compared to state-of-the-art methods
- F1-score increases from 89.78% to 91.38% with hyperlocal point cloud representations
- Superior performance across multiple datasets spanning different age groups (dHCP, ABCD, HCP, PPMI, BTP)
- Robust segmentation of both major and minor white matter tracts despite class imbalance challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TractoEmbed's effectiveness stems from its hierarchical representation learning approach that captures information at multiple scales. The method encodes local geometric features through streamline-level representations, cluster-level spatial relationships, and patch-level regional context. This multi-level abstraction allows the model to learn distinctive features for similar-looking tracts while maintaining sensitivity to subject-specific variations. The modular design enables specialized learning at each level, with the Cluster Encoder particularly effective at distinguishing structurally similar tracts through point cloud representations.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion MRI preprocessing: Required to convert raw MRI data into tractography streamlines; quick check: verify streamline quality and completeness
- Point cloud sampling (FPS, kNN): Needed to create local and hyperlocal representations; quick check: ensure uniform sampling and correct neighbor selection
- Focal Loss: Addresses class imbalance between major and minor tracts; quick check: monitor class-specific F1 scores during training
- dVAE architecture: Enables unsupervised learning of patch-level representations; quick check: validate reconstruction quality of learned patches
- CNN feature extraction: Processes streamline-level information; quick check: confirm filter sizes capture appropriate spatial patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Streamline Encoder -> Cluster Encoder -> Patch Encoder -> MECL Concatenation -> Classifier MLP

Critical path: Fiber Descriptor extraction → Streamline Encoder → MECL → Classifier → Final Classification

Design tradeoffs: The modular approach trades off end-to-end optimization for flexibility and interpretability. While this allows easy integration of new embeddings and independent component training, it may miss cross-level interactions that joint training could capture.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on projection fibers (particularly in corticospinal tract) due to over-reliance on shape features; class imbalance issues manifesting as low F1 scores for minor tracts; overfitting indicated by large train-test performance gaps.

First experiments:
1. Implement Fiber Descriptor with exact parameter settings to verify streamline encoding consistency
2. Test dVAE architecture with different regional patch sizes to assess sensitivity to this design choice
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each embedding level (streamline, cluster, patch) to overall performance
