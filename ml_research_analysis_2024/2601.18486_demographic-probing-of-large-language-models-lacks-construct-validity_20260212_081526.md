core_contribution: This paper examines whether different demographic cues (names,
  dialect, dialog history, explicit descriptors) reliably signal the same demographically
  conditioned behavior in large language models. Using prompts for healthcare, salary,
  and legal advice, it tests construct validity by measuring how consistently different
  cues induce similar changes in model behavior within the same demographic group.

# Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.18486
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18486
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Different demographic cues (names, dialect, dialog history, explicit descriptors) produce inconsistent behavioral changes in LLMs, undermining construct validity for demographic probing.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether demographic cues reliably signal consistent demographic-conditioned behavior in large language models. Using prompts for healthcare, salary, and legal advice, the study tests how consistently different cues (names, dialect, dialog history, explicit descriptors) induce similar changes in model behavior within the same demographic group. The results show that convergence across cues is only partial, with correlation coefficients often below 0.8, and weak group differentiation, as responses to different groups are highly similar within a cue. These inconsistencies partly stem from differences in how strongly cues are associated with demographic groups and from linguistic confounders that independently affect model behavior. The study concludes that demographic probing lacks construct validity and recommends using multiple ecologically valid cues while controlling for confounders to draw defensible conclusions about demographic effects.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multi-cue experimental design to test construct validity in demographic probing. Researchers use four types of demographic cues (names, dialect, dialog history, explicit descriptors) across three task domains (healthcare, salary, legal advice). They measure convergence by calculating correlation coefficients between behavioral responses elicited by different cues targeting the same demographic groups. The analysis examines both intragroup convergence (consistency across cues for the same group) and intergroup differentiation (distinctiveness of responses across different groups). Linguistic confounders are identified through controlled comparisons of cue variants.

## Key Results
- Convergence across demographic cues is only partial, with correlation coefficients often below 0.8
- Weak group differentiation, as responses to different groups are highly similar within a cue
- Intergroup comparisons vary in magnitude and direction across cues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The inconsistent behavioral responses stem from two primary sources: varying strength of association between different demographic cues and their target groups, and linguistic confounders that independently influence model behavior. When cues have different levels of association strength with demographic groups, the model produces divergent responses even when targeting the same underlying demographic. Additionally, linguistic features inherent in the cues (such as vocabulary choice, syntactic patterns, or discourse markers) can trigger independent behavioral changes that obscure the intended demographic signal.

## Foundational Learning
- **Demographic cue association**: Understanding how different cues map to demographic groups is essential for interpreting model behavior
  - *Why needed*: Different cues have varying strength of association with demographic groups, affecting behavioral consistency
  - *Quick check*: Compare cue-to-group mapping strength across name, dialect, dialog history, and explicit descriptor cues

- **Linguistic confounding**: Language patterns can independently influence model responses beyond demographic signals
  - *Why needed*: Linguistic features may create spurious correlations that appear as demographic effects
  - *Quick check*: Identify linguistic features that correlate with demographic cues but affect responses independently

- **Construct validity measurement**: Correlation thresholds determine whether cue convergence is sufficient
  - *Why needed*: The arbitrary nature of correlation cutoffs (<0.8 as "only partial") affects interpretation of results
  - *Quick check*: Test sensitivity of conclusions to different correlation threshold values

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Demographic cue generation -> Model response generation -> Behavioral measurement -> Correlation analysis -> Construct validity assessment
- **Critical path**: Cue generation → Model response → Behavioral measurement → Correlation calculation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-cue simplicity vs. multi-cue convergence accuracy; task specificity vs. generalizability
- **Failure signatures**: Low intragroup correlation indicates cue inconsistency; high intergroup similarity suggests weak differentiation
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Test convergence patterns across broader demographic attributes and task domains
  2. Generate cue variants holding linguistic features constant while varying demographic signal
  3. Combine multiple demographic cues to test whether aggregation improves construct validity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on limited demographic cues and specific task domains, may not generalize to other contexts
- Does not address potential interactions between multiple demographic cues or their combined effects
- Correlation thresholds used to assess convergence are somewhat arbitrary

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Different demographic cues produce inconsistent behavioral changes within the same demographic group
- **Medium confidence**: Demographic probing lacks construct validity overall
- **Low confidence**: Specific recommendation to use "ecologically valid cues" without clear operational definition

## Next Checks
1. Test convergence patterns across a broader range of demographic attributes and task domains
2. Systematically control for linguistic confounders by generating cue variants that hold linguistic features constant
3. Investigate effects of combining multiple demographic cues simultaneously
