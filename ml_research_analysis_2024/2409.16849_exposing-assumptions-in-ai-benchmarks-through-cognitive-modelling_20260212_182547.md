# Exposing Assumptions in AI Benchmarks through Cognitive Modelling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16849
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SEM reveals positive correlation between Danish and English cultural knowledge in LLMs (ρ = 0.48, p = 0.03)

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to make explicit the implicit assumptions in cultural AI benchmarks. By formulating cognitive models as SEMs, the approach reveals how latent constructs like language ability, cultural knowledge, and alignment transfer across languages. The method is illustrated through cross-lingual alignment transfer between English and Danish, demonstrating a meaningful positive correlation between cultural knowledge in LLMs. The framework provides theoretical grounding for benchmark construction, guides dataset development, and improves construct validity by connecting multiple benchmarks to underlying constructs.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Structural Equation Models to represent relationships between latent variables (language ability, cultural knowledge, alignment) and observable benchmark datasets. The model structure is visualized graphically rather than through equations, making assumptions transparent. SEM is implemented using the semopy Python framework, with model fit evaluated using RMSEA (target near zero) and CFI (target above 1). The method tests hypotheses about cross-lingual transfer by analyzing correlations between latent constructs across languages, using benchmark data from 45 LLMs including both commercial and open-source models.

## Key Results
- Positive correlation between Danish and English cultural knowledge in LLMs (ρ = 0.48, p = 0.03)
- Excellent model fit with RMSEA near zero and CFI above 1
- Framework successfully grounds benchmark construction theoretically and identifies gaps in existing datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structural Equation Modeling makes explicit the latent relationships between cultural constructs across languages
- Mechanism: By representing language ability, cultural knowledge, and alignment as latent variables connected through directional and covariance arrows, the model quantifies how these constructs transfer between English and Danish
- Core assumption: Latent variables are meaningful constructs that can be measured through observable benchmarks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "explicit cognitive models formulated as Structural Equation Models (SEM) to expose implicit assumptions in cultural AI benchmarks"
- Break condition: If the observed correlation between Danish and English cultural knowledge is not statistically significant or meaningful, the model fails to capture cross-lingual transfer

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Visual representations of cognitive models improve accessibility and critique ability
- Mechanism: By using graphical representations instead of equations, the model makes assumptions transparent and easier to question, enabling broader participation in AI evaluation discussions
- Core assumption: Simplified visual models are more accessible than mathematical formalisms for understanding complex AI benchmark assumptions
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "By embracing transparency, we move towards more rigorous, cumulative AI evaluation science"
- Break condition: If the graphical representation oversimplifies relationships to the point of misleading interpretation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cognitive modeling identifies gaps in existing benchmarks and guides dataset development
- Mechanism: By explicitly modeling the relationships between constructs, the framework reveals which datasets are needed to fully measure the theoretical constructs, directing researchers to develop appropriate benchmarks
- Core assumption: Gaps in benchmark coverage can be identified by comparing the theoretical model to available datasets
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This framework grounds benchmark construction theoretically and guides dataset development to improve construct measurement"
- Break condition: If the identified gaps do not correspond to meaningful constructs or if the suggested datasets fail to improve measurement validity

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
  - Why needed here: SEM provides the mathematical framework to represent and test relationships between latent variables and observable variables
  - Quick check question: What are the two main components of an SEM model and how do they differ?

- Concept: Latent vs Observable Variables
  - Why needed here: Understanding the distinction between theoretical constructs and their measurable indicators is crucial for proper model construction
  - Quick check question: Why can't we directly measure "cultural knowledge" and instead need observable indicators?

- Concept: Construct Validity
  - Why needed here: Ensuring that the latent variables actually represent what they claim to measure is essential for meaningful interpretation of the model results
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between convergent and discriminant validity in construct measurement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data layer: Benchmark datasets (CoLA, SocialIQA, Danish tasks, etc.)
  - Model layer: SEM specification with latent variables and their relationships
  - Analysis layer: Fit indices (RMSEA, CFI) and hypothesis testing (correlation significance)
  - Visualization layer: Graphical representation of the model structure

- Critical path:
  1. Select appropriate benchmark datasets
  2. Define latent variables and their relationships
  3. Estimate model parameters using SEM software
  4. Evaluate model fit and test hypotheses
  5. Interpret results in context of construct validity

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. Completeness: Simpler models are easier to interpret but may miss important relationships
  - Data requirements: More complex models require more data points for reliable estimation
  - Theoretical assumptions: The model's validity depends on the appropriateness of the assumed relationships

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor model fit (high RMSEA, low CFI)
  - Non-significant or unexpected correlations between theoretically related constructs
  - Benchmark loadings that don't align with theoretical expectations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the baseline model with all hypothesized relationships between English and Danish constructs
  2. Remove the cross-lingual correlation to test if the transfer effect is necessary
  3. Test alternative specifications to explore different theoretical interpretations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the correlation between Danish and English cultural knowledge in LLMs represent true cultural alignment or merely language proficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that "Cultural Knowledge" might actually represent "Language Ability" or some other factor
- Why unresolved: The model shows a significant correlation (ρ = 0.48, p = 0.03) between Danish and English cultural knowledge, but the paper explicitly states this could be measuring language ability rather than cultural knowledge
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments using datasets that specifically isolate cultural knowledge from language proficiency

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do we validate that the latent variables in SEM truly represent the intended constructs rather than confounding factors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "SEMs provide an elegant way to test relationships between latent variables. However, whether these variables represent valid constructs in the real world requires careful theoretical considerations"
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the technical feasibility of SEM but emphasizes that construct validity remains a challenge requiring theoretical work beyond statistical modeling
- What evidence would resolve it: Multiple independent validation studies using diverse datasets and expert consensus on construct definitions

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the minimum dataset size and diversity required for reliable SEM analysis of LLM capabilities across languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "testing complex, realistic models requires larger datasets" and notes computational constraints in generating benchmark data
- Why unresolved: The analysis uses 45 LLMs but acknowledges this may be insufficient for complex models, and scaling requires significant computational resources
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic studies comparing SEM results across different dataset sizes and model counts

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability: The empirical validation relies on a single correlation finding from a specific dataset, which may not generalize to other language pairs or cultural contexts
- Risk of overfitting: The model's excellent fit indices (RMSEA near zero, CFI above 1) could indicate overfitting, especially given the relatively small sample size of 45 LLMs
- Measurement validity challenges: The approach assumes that latent constructs like "cultural knowledge" can be meaningfully measured through benchmark tasks, but this measurement validity is not independently verified

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodological framework and SEM implementation
- Medium confidence in the cross-lingual correlation finding (limited to this specific case)
- Low confidence in generalizability to other language pairs and cultural contexts

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the analysis with additional language pairs and cultural contexts to test generalizability
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying model specifications and testing robustness of findings
3. Validate measurement validity through expert review of whether benchmark tasks truly capture intended cultural constructs
