# Empowering Time Series Analysis with Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02358
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey categorizing foundation models for time series into time series-based, language-based, and vision-based models, analyzing unique challenges and proposing future research directions

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models for time series analysis, addressing the growing need for powerful, generalizable models in this domain. The authors systematically review approaches that adapt pre-trained foundation models from NLP and CV domains to time series tasks, identifying three main categories: time series-based models, language-based models adapted to time series, and vision-based models adapted to time series. The survey highlights the unique challenges each category faces, including data scarcity, input encoding, modality alignment, and task configuration, while proposing a modality-aware, challenge-oriented taxonomy to organize existing solutions.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review approach, identifying and categorizing 91 target papers across three main categories of foundation models for time series analysis. The methodology involves searching academic databases for papers on foundation models applied to time series from 2018-2025, focusing on works that explicitly adapt pre-trained models from NLP/CV domains. Papers are categorized by pre-training modality and analyzed for key information on challenges, solutions, and applications. The synthesis results in a unified taxonomy that captures modality-specific challenges while maintaining clear categorization boundaries.

## Key Results
- Foundation models for time series can be categorized into time series-based, language-based, and vision-based models, each facing distinct challenges
- Time series-specific architectural designs (channel attention, frequency decomposition) and data augmentation strategies (FreqMix, FreqMask) are critical for adapting foundation models to time series tasks
- Applications span finance, healthcare, and transportation domains, with future research directions including interpretability, time series reasoning, and agent-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Foundation models for time series work by aligning time series data with the semantic space of pre-trained language or vision models. Time series data is encoded into a format (textual or visual) that matches the pre-training modality of the foundation model, enabling transfer of learned representations. The core assumption is that the pre-trained model's learned representations can generalize to time series tasks when the input modality is properly aligned. Evidence anchors include the paper's discussion of "Temporal and Textual Semantic Space Alignment" and related encoding strategies. This mechanism breaks if the encoding fails to preserve temporal dependencies or if the foundation model's semantic space is too dissimilar from time series characteristics.

### Mechanism 2
Time series foundation models can capture diverse temporal patterns through specialized architectural designs. Architectural enhancements (e.g., channel attention, frequency decomposition) are integrated into transformer backbones to model temporal dependencies and inter-variable relationships. The core assumption is that these added architectural components can effectively model time series-specific characteristics without degrading the foundation model's general capabilities. Evidence anchors include the paper's observation that "Most TSFMs adopt transformer architectures without inductive biases" and the need for time-series-specific designs. This mechanism breaks if the architectural enhancements do not improve performance on time series tasks or lead to overfitting on specific datasets.

### Mechanism 3
Data augmentation strategies can significantly expand the scale and diversity of time series data for foundation model pre-training. Techniques like FreqMix, FreqMask, and synthetic data generation are applied to create additional training samples and diversify distributions. The core assumption is that augmented data can effectively simulate real-world time series patterns and improve model robustness. Evidence anchors include the discussion of "Data augmentation has emerged as a key technique" and the specific example of Lag-Llama applying FreqMix and FreqMask. This mechanism breaks if augmented data fails to improve model performance or introduces biases that degrade generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Modality Alignment
  - Why needed here: Foundation models are pre-trained on specific modalities (text, images) and need to be adapted to process time series data.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how time series data is transformed to match the semantic space of a pre-trained language model?

- Concept: Architectural Design for Time Series
  - Why needed here: Standard transformer architectures may not capture time series-specific characteristics like temporal dependencies and inter-variable relationships.
  - Quick check question: What architectural enhancements are commonly used to improve time series modeling in foundation models?

- Concept: Data Augmentation for Time Series
  - Why needed here: Limited availability of large-scale, diverse time series datasets necessitates data augmentation to improve model robustness and generalization.
  - Quick check question: What are some common data augmentation techniques used for time series foundation models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input encoding layer → Modality alignment module → Foundation model backbone (transformer/vision transformer/language model) → Task-specific output head
- Critical path: Input encoding → Modality alignment → Foundation model processing → Task-specific output
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing model complexity with computational efficiency, choosing between channel-independent and channel-mixing settings, selecting appropriate data augmentation strategies
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on time series tasks, inability to generalize across datasets, overfitting to specific patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the impact of different input encoding strategies (string-based vs. numeric-based) on model performance
  2. Compare the effectiveness of channel-independent vs. channel-mixing settings for multivariate time series tasks
  3. Assess the contribution of data augmentation techniques to model robustness and generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can time series reasoning with LLMs be standardized with a clear definition and benchmark?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses the lack of a unified definition of time series reasoning and highlights the need for standardized benchmarks to evaluate this capability.
- Why unresolved: Different studies frame time series reasoning differently, from causal inference to question answering, making it difficult to compare progress or establish consistent evaluation protocols.
- What evidence would resolve it: A widely accepted definition, standardized benchmark datasets, and consistent evaluation metrics for time series reasoning tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can interpretability be effectively integrated into foundation models for time series without sacrificing performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies interpretability as a critical challenge for deploying foundation models in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous driving, noting that most current efforts prioritize performance over explainability.
- Why unresolved: Balancing the complexity of foundation models with the need for transparent decision-making remains a significant challenge, with few existing solutions that effectively address both aspects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating interpretable foundation models that achieve competitive performance on time series tasks in high-stakes domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between pre-training data scale and architectural innovation for time series foundation models?
- Basis in paper: The paper highlights the importance of large-scale pre-training corpora for time series foundation models, but also notes the potential of architectural innovations and efficient designs like TTM.
- Why unresolved: While large-scale pre-training is crucial, the relative impact of data scale versus architectural advancements on model performance remains unclear, and the optimal balance may vary across different time series tasks and domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies systematically varying pre-training data scale and architectural complexity to identify the most effective combinations for specific time series tasks and domains.

## Limitations
- The field is rapidly evolving with new methods emerging regularly, making it difficult to capture the complete landscape
- Analysis of modality-specific challenges is well-supported but proposed solutions often lack rigorous comparative evaluation across diverse time series tasks
- Focus on pre-trained foundation models may underrepresent emerging approaches that train models specifically for time series from scratch

## Confidence
- Medium confidence for taxonomy framework and challenge identification
- Low confidence for definitive claims about which adaptation strategies are most effective
- Medium confidence overall due to evolving nature of field and limited empirical comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing different time series encoding approaches (string-based vs. numeric-based) across multiple foundation model backbones to quantify performance differences and identify optimal strategies for different time series characteristics.

2. Evaluate the surveyed foundation models on benchmark datasets from multiple domains (finance, healthcare, IoT) to assess their generalizability claims and identify domain-specific limitations that may not be apparent from single-domain studies.

3. Systematically measure the computational overhead of different architectural enhancements and data augmentation strategies to provide practical guidance on trade-offs between model complexity and real-world deployment feasibility.
