# Understanding Higher-Order Correlations Among Semantic Components in Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.19919
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19919
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Higher-order correlations between ICA components reveal semantic associations that pairwise correlations miss

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates non-independence in ICA-transformed word embeddings by quantifying higher-order correlations between components. The authors demonstrate that large higher-order correlations indicate strong semantic associations between components, and visualize these relationships using a maximum spanning tree. Their approach reveals that words with large values in both correlated components often share meanings from both semantic axes, providing insight into the compositional nature of word embeddings.

## Method Summary
The authors train 300-dimensional SGNS embeddings on the text8 corpus, apply ICA transformation to obtain independent components, and compute higher-order correlations E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) as measures of non-independence. They construct a maximum spanning tree using these correlations as edge weights and perform spectral clustering to group semantically related components. The method includes quantitative evaluation using GPT-4o mini for word intrusion tasks and word similarity assessments, along with qualitative analysis of component associations.

## Key Results
- Higher-order correlations between ICA components are non-zero, indicating non-independence that pairwise correlations miss
- Words with large values of S²ₜ,ᵢS²ₜ,ⱼ contribute significantly to higher-order correlations and exhibit semantic compositionality
- Maximum spanning tree visualization reveals hierarchical structure of semantic associations between components
- Dimensionality reduction via MST clustering better preserves semantic relationships than random clustering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Higher-order correlations E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) quantify non-independence between ICA components that cannot be captured by pairwise correlations alone.
- Mechanism: When two components are independent, E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) = 1. Deviation from 1 indicates statistical dependence, which manifests as semantic associations between the components.
- Core assumption: The components are whitened (zero mean, unit variance, uncorrelated) before computing higher-order correlations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We quantified these non-independencies using higher-order correlations and demonstrated that when the higher-order correlation between two components is large, it indicates a strong semantic association between them"
  - [section 3] "E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) = 1/n Σ S²ₜ,ᵢS²ₜ,ⱼ. Here, S is the whitened matrix. If Si and Sj are independent of each other, then E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) = E(S²ᵢ)E(S²ⱼ) = 1"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus only shows related papers but no direct evidence about higher-order correlation computation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Words with large values of S²ₜ,ᵢS²ₜ,ⱼ contribute significantly to the higher-order correlation and represent semantic compositionality.
- Mechanism: Words that score highly on both correlated components share meanings from both semantic axes, demonstrating additive compositionality in embeddings.
- Core assumption: Large S²ₜ,ᵢS²ₜ,ⱼ values indicate meaningful contributions to semantic composition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "words wt with large values of S²ₜ,ᵢS²ₜ,ⱼ are considered to make a significant contribution to the higher-order correlation"
  - [section 4.3] "For example, in the Axis 10 and Axis 2 pair, words like ribose, deoxyribose, phosphodiester, biosynthesis, methyltransferase, and pyrimidine notably contribute to the E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) value, linking biomolecules and chemical components"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence about compositionality patterns

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Maximum spanning tree (MST) visualization reveals the overall structure of non-independence between semantic components.
- Mechanism: MST connects components with large higher-order correlations, grouping semantically related components and revealing hierarchical relationships.
- Core assumption: MST provides a meaningful representation of the non-independence structure that balances visibility and element relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "We compute the maximum spanning tree (MST) T150, a spanning tree that maximizes the sum of cij in the graph G150"
  - [section 5] "The MST T150 represents a graph structure expressing the non-independence between estimated independent components"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related papers but no evidence about MST visualization effectiveness

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
  - Why needed here: ICA transforms word embeddings into interpretable semantic components, which is the foundation for analyzing non-independence
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between ICA and PCA in terms of what they optimize for?

- Concept: Statistical independence vs. uncorrelatedness
  - Why needed here: ICA aims for independence but achieves only uncorrelatedness in practice, which is why non-independence analysis is necessary
  - Quick check question: Can two uncorrelated variables still be statistically dependent? Give an example.

- Concept: Higher-order moments and correlations
  - Why needed here: Higher-order correlations capture dependencies that pairwise correlations miss, which is essential for quantifying non-independence
  - Quick check question: What's the relationship between E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) and the independence of components Si and Sj?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ICA transformation -> higher-order correlation computation -> MST construction -> semantic interpretation
- Critical path: SGNS embeddings -> ICA whitening -> E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) calculation -> MST generation -> visualization and interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Higher-order correlation computation is more computationally intensive than pairwise correlation but captures more nuanced dependencies
- Failure signatures: Low variance in higher-order correlations, poor semantic coherence in MST clusters, failure to converge in ICA computation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify ICA whitening: Check that E(SᵢSⱼ) ≈ 0 for all i≠j in transformed embeddings
  2. Validate higher-order correlation: Compute E(S²ᵢS²ⱼ) for known independent vs dependent component pairs
  3. Test MST construction: Build MST on synthetic data with known structure and verify clustering quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do higher-order correlations between ICA components change when using different embedding types (e.g., GloVe, BERT, RoBERTa) compared to SGNS?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their experiments are limited to SGNS word embeddings and suggest that experiments using various types of embeddings are necessary for a more thorough analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested SGNS embeddings, leaving open whether the observed patterns of higher-order correlations and semantic associations generalize to other embedding methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing higher-order correlation patterns and semantic associations across multiple embedding types would demonstrate generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the maximum spanning tree (MST) structure derived from higher-order correlations be used to improve downstream NLP tasks like semantic similarity or classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors show that dimensionality reduction via MST clustering better preserves semantic relationships than random clustering, but only evaluate word similarity tasks.
- Why unresolved: While the MST captures semantic structure, the paper doesn't test whether this structure can be leveraged for broader NLP applications beyond similarity measurement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying MST-based dimensionality reduction to specific downstream tasks (classification, information retrieval, etc.) with performance comparisons to baselines would demonstrate practical utility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational complexity of calculating higher-order correlations scale with embedding dimensionality and vocabulary size, and what are the most efficient approximation methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that calculating higher-order correlations may become computationally intensive for large embedding matrices and suggest subsampling and parallelization as potential solutions.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide empirical analysis of computational requirements or benchmark different approximation methods for calculating higher-order correlations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking studies measuring computation time and accuracy trade-offs for various subsampling rates, parallelization strategies, and approximation algorithms would identify optimal approaches.

## Limitations

- Limited to SGNS embeddings, leaving generalizability to other embedding types unknown
- Computational intensity of higher-order correlation calculation for large embedding matrices
- Lack of systematic validation for the additive compositionality claim beyond qualitative examples

## Confidence

- **Confidence in core mechanism**: Medium-High
- **Confidence in MST visualization approach**: Medium
- **Confidence in additive compositionality claim**: Low-Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Whitening verification**: Test the ICA transformation by computing E(SᵢSⱼ) for all i≠j in the transformed embeddings to verify that components are truly uncorrelated before computing higher-order correlations.

2. **Prompt validation**: Systematically vary the GPT-4o mini prompts for word intrusion and component similarity tasks to assess robustness of evaluation scores to prompt formulation.

3. **Controlled compositionality test**: Create synthetic embedding pairs with known semantic composition patterns and verify whether higher-order correlation correctly identifies these patterns and whether words with large S²ₜ,ᵢS²ₜ,ⱼ values exhibit the expected semantic compositionality.
