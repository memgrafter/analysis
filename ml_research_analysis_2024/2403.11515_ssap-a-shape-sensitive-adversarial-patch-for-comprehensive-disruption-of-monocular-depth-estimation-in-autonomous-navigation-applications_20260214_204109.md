# SSAP: A Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch for Comprehensive Disruption of Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Navigation Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.11515
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11515
- Reference count: 37
- One-line primary result: SSAP achieves a mean depth estimation error exceeding 0.5, impacting up to 99% of the targeted region for CNN-based MDE models.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes SSAP, a shape-sensitive adversarial patch designed to comprehensively disrupt monocular depth estimation (MDE) in autonomous navigation systems. SSAP generates a patch tailored to the specific shape and scale of the target object, enabling it to induce errors in depth estimation or create the illusion of the object disappearing. The patch is trained to be effective across varying scales and distances from the camera. Experimental results demonstrate that SSAP achieves a mean depth estimation error exceeding 0.5, impacting up to 99% of the targeted region for CNN-based MDE models. It also yields a significant error of 0.59 with substantial influence over 99% of the target region for Transformer-based MDE models.

## Method Summary
SSAP is an adversarial patch generation method that targets monocular depth estimation systems in autonomous navigation. It leverages a pre-trained object detector (YOLOv4-tiny) to identify target objects, generates adversarial patches, and optimizes them using a penalized loss function. The patch is trained to be effective across varying scales and distances from the camera by applying geometric transformations during training. The optimization process uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 for 500 epochs. The method aims to expand the affected region beyond the immediate proximity of the patch by prioritizing alterations in non-overlapping regions.

## Key Results
- SSAP achieves a mean depth estimation error exceeding 0.5 for CNN-based MDE models, impacting up to 99% of the targeted region.
- For Transformer-based MDE models, SSAP yields a significant error of 0.59 with substantial influence over 99% of the target region.
- The adversarial patch is trained to be effective across varying scales and distances from the camera, demonstrating robustness in real-world conditions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The adversarial patch exploits scale and perspective variations by applying geometric transformations during training.
- Mechanism: The patch transformation block applies random scaling, rotation, and color adjustments to the patch, simulating real-world conditions where the patch may appear at different distances and angles relative to the camera.
- Core assumption: The MDE model's depth predictions are sensitive to local texture and color changes introduced by the patch, and the model cannot distinguish these from genuine depth cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The patch is trained to effectively address different scales and distances from the camera.
  - [section II-D] Random Scaling: The patch's dimensions are randomly adjusted to approximately match its real-world proportions within the scene. Random Rotations: The patch P is subjected to random rotations (up to ±20◦) centered around the bounding boxes BU i,k.
- Break condition: If the MDE model employs strong spatial context reasoning or attention mechanisms that can detect and ignore localized adversarial perturbations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The shape-sensitive design ensures the patch affects the entire target object, not just the overlapping region.
- Mechanism: By using a pre-trained object detector to identify the target object's bounding box, the patch is placed at the object's center and extended to cover its full area via the focus mask Mf, ensuring comprehensive influence.
- Core assumption: The object detector's bounding box accurately captures the object's extent, and the MDE model's depth estimation is influenced by the entire object region, not just the patch's immediate area.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Our patch is shape-sensitive, meaning it considers the specific shape and scale of the target object, thereby extending its influence beyond immediate proximity.
  - [section II-C] Two distinct masks arise from this process: Mf, encircling the object to demarcate its influence, and Mp, designed to restrict the patch's characteristics.
- Break condition: If the object detector fails to accurately localize the object, or if the MDE model's depth estimation is robust to large-scale texture changes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The penalized depth loss function prioritizes altering non-overlapping regions to expand the affected area.
- Mechanism: The loss function Ldepth combines Ld1 (overlapping pixels) and Ld2 (non-overlapping pixels) with a quadratic penalty on Ld1, encouraging the optimization to focus on changing depth predictions in regions beyond the patch itself.
- Core assumption: The MDE model's depth estimation is differentiable with respect to the input, and the gradient updates from the penalized loss will propagate changes beyond the patch's immediate area.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] We introduce a novel penalized loss function aimed at enhancing the efficiency of our adversarial patch and expanding its impact region.
  - [section II-E] To direct the optimization process towards prioritizing the reduction of the non-overlapped pixel loss Ld2, we employ a squaring operation on the term denoting the disparity between the output depth and the target depth.
- Break condition: If the MDE model's depth estimation is non-differentiable or if the model employs mechanisms to resist gradient-based attacks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial patch generation and optimization.
  - Why needed here: The core of SSAP is crafting a patch that can physically deceive a depth estimation system, requiring understanding of how adversarial examples are generated and optimized.
  - Quick check question: How does the Adam optimizer update the patch during training, and what role do the loss terms play in guiding these updates?

- Concept: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) and its vulnerabilities.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how MDE models work and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks is crucial for designing effective attacks like SSAP.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between CNN-based and Transformer-based MDE models, and how might these differences affect their vulnerability to adversarial patches?

- Concept: Object detection and its integration with adversarial attacks.
  - Why needed here: SSAP uses a pre-trained object detector to localize targets, so understanding how object detection works and how it can be integrated into attack pipelines is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the YOLOv4-tiny detector's output (bounding boxes) inform the placement and shape of the adversarial patch in SSAP?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Patch Generator -> Patch Transformation Block -> Patch Applier -> Object Detector (YOLOv4-tiny) -> MDE Model -> Loss Function

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize adversarial patch.
  2. Transform patch (scaling, rotation, color).
  3. Apply patch to input image using object detector's bounding boxes.
  4. Forward pass through MDE model to get depth predictions.
  5. Compute loss (depth + total variation).
  6. Backpropagate and update patch.
  7. Repeat until convergence.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Patch size vs. stealth: Larger patches are more effective but more noticeable.
  - Training data vs. generalization: Training on diverse scenes improves robustness but increases computational cost.
  - Loss function complexity vs. optimization stability: Penalized loss expands influence but may slow convergence.

- Failure signatures:
  - Patch has minimal effect on depth predictions: Check if transformations are too aggressive or if the object detector is failing.
  - Patch only affects local region: Verify that the penalized loss is correctly implemented and that the focus mask is properly defined.
  - Optimization diverges: Reduce learning rate or simplify loss function.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train SSAP on a simple scene with a single car at a fixed distance, using a small patch and basic loss function. Verify that the patch affects depth predictions.
  2. Introduce geometric transformations (scaling, rotation) and test robustness to distance variations. Measure mean depth error and affected region ratio.
  3. Replace the basic loss with the penalized depth loss and evaluate if the affected region expands beyond the patch's immediate area.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the SSAP approach compare in terms of attack effectiveness when applied to other object categories beyond cars and pedestrians, such as bicycles or traffic signs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the devised attack methodology is generic and applicable to various object categories present on public roads, but focuses on cars and pedestrians for proof-of-concept.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides experimental results for cars and pedestrians, leaving the effectiveness of SSAP on other object categories unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with SSAP on various object categories (e.g., bicycles, traffic signs) and comparing the results with those for cars and pedestrians.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential defense mechanisms that could be developed to mitigate the impact of SSAP on monocular depth estimation systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes by highlighting the need for more robust and adaptive defense mechanisms against the proposed attack.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss any potential defense strategies against SSAP.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposing and evaluating various defense mechanisms (e.g., input transformations, adversarial training) to assess their effectiveness in mitigating SSAP attacks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of SSAP vary when applied to different MDE models, such as those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers, in terms of both attack effectiveness and computational complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that SSAP is effective against both CNN-based and transformer-based MDE models, but does not provide a detailed comparison of its performance across different model types.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides results for a few specific MDE models and does not discuss the general performance of SSAP across different model architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with SSAP on various MDE models (e.g., different CNN architectures, transformer variants) and comparing the attack effectiveness and computational complexity across these models.

## Limitations
- The evaluation is constrained to two specific MDE architectures (MiDaS-v3.0 and DPT-Large) and two object classes (cars and pedestrians), limiting the generalization of SSAP to other models and object categories.
- The paper does not extensively address real-world deployment scenarios involving dynamic lighting conditions, occlusions, or sensor noise, which could impact the patch's effectiveness.
- The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support claims about SSAP's effectiveness against MDE models that employ strong spatial context reasoning or attention mechanisms designed to detect and ignore localized adversarial perturbations.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of shape-sensitive patch generation and the use of a penalized loss function to expand the affected region are well-supported by the presented evidence and theoretical framework.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of SSAP across varying scales and distances is demonstrated through experimental results, but the extent of its robustness to diverse real-world conditions requires further validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support claims about SSAP's effectiveness against MDE models that employ strong spatial context reasoning or attention mechanisms designed to detect and ignore localized adversarial perturbations.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to Diverse MDE Architectures**: Evaluate SSAP's effectiveness against a broader range of MDE models, including those using different architectural paradigms (e.g., CNNs, Transformers, hybrid models) and training objectives.
2. **Real-World Deployment Testing**: Conduct experiments in dynamic real-world environments with varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and sensor noise to assess the patch's robustness and effectiveness in practical scenarios.
3. **Countermeasure Resistance**: Investigate SSAP's vulnerability to potential countermeasures, such as adversarial training or input preprocessing techniques, to understand its limitations and potential evasion strategies.
