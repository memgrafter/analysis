- Three deep learning architectures compared for storm surge prediction in Tampa Bay, Florida

## Executive Summary
This paper compares three deep learning architectures—CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and 3D-CNN—for storm surge prediction in Tampa Bay, Florida. Using high-resolution atmospheric data from CFSv2 and historical water level data from NOAA tide stations, the models were trained and tested to evaluate their performance. The CNN-LSTM model achieved the best results with a test loss of 0.010 and an R-squared (R2) score of 0.84, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness, especially during extreme events like Hurricane Ian, which caused a significant negative surge of -1.5 meters. While the LSTM model showed the lowest training loss (0.007) and highest training R2 (0.88), it exhibited poorer generalization with a test loss of 0.014 and an R2 of 0.77. The 3D-CNN model performed reasonably well with a test loss of 0.011 and an R2 of 0.82 but displayed instability under extreme conditions. Overall, the CNN-LSTM architecture proved most effective for storm surge prediction, offering a balanced approach to capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data.

## Method Summary
The study employs three deep learning architectures—CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and 3D-CNN—for storm surge prediction in Tampa Bay, Florida. High-resolution atmospheric data from CFSv2 and historical water level data from NOAA tide stations are used for training and testing. The models are evaluated using standard metrics including test loss and R-squared (R2) scores. The CNN-LSTM model combines convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction with LSTM layers for temporal sequence modeling, while the LSTM model focuses on temporal dependencies and the 3D-CNN model captures both spatial and temporal features through 3D convolutions. Performance is assessed across training and testing phases, with particular attention to extreme event prediction capabilities.

## Key Results
- CNN-LSTM achieved the best performance with test loss of 0.010 and R2 of 0.84
- LSTM showed best training performance (loss 0.007, R2 0.88) but poorer generalization (test loss 0.014, R2 0.77)
- 3D-CNN performed reasonably with test loss of 0.011 and R2 of 0.82 but showed instability during extreme events

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CNN-LSTM architecture excels at storm surge prediction because it effectively captures both spatial patterns in atmospheric data and temporal dependencies in water level changes. The convolutional layers extract meaningful spatial features from atmospheric inputs, while LSTM layers model the sequential nature of storm surge development over time. This dual capability allows the model to better understand how atmospheric conditions translate into water level changes, particularly during complex weather events. The architecture's ability to generalize well to unseen data, especially extreme events like Hurricane Ian, demonstrates its effectiveness in handling real-world variability and complexity in storm surge phenomena.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatial-temporal modeling**: Storm surges are driven by both spatial atmospheric patterns and temporal evolution - quick check: can the model predict water levels 6-12 hours ahead with reasonable accuracy?
- **Extreme event detection**: Models must handle rare but high-impact events like hurricanes - quick check: does performance degrade significantly during storm conditions compared to normal weather?
- **Time series forecasting**: Storm surge prediction requires modeling sequential dependencies - quick check: can the model maintain accuracy over extended prediction horizons?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Data -> CNN-LSTM -> Prediction
**Critical Path**: Atmospheric data preprocessing → Spatial feature extraction (CNN) → Temporal sequence modeling (LSTM) → Water level prediction
**Design Tradeoffs**: CNN-LSTM balances spatial and temporal modeling but adds complexity compared to pure LSTM; 3D-CNN captures both dimensions but may struggle with temporal dynamics
**Failure Signatures**: LSTM shows overfitting (good training, poor test performance); 3D-CNN exhibits instability during extreme events; all models may fail with insufficient training data
**First Experiments**: 1) Test on historical hurricane events beyond Hurricane Ian, 2) Evaluate on different coastal regions, 3) Compare with traditional physics-based models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Geographic focus on Tampa Bay limits generalizability to other coastal regions
- Evaluation period included only one extreme event (Hurricane Ian)
- Relies on CFSv2 atmospheric data with known resolution and accuracy limitations
- Comparison based on specific training configurations that may not represent optimal settings

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The comparative performance ranking of the three architectures (CNN-LSTM > 3D-CNN > LSTM) is supported by consistent metrics across training and testing phases.

**Medium Confidence**: The superiority of CNN-LSTM for extreme event prediction is based on a single case study (Hurricane Ian) and requires validation across multiple extreme events.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific numerical results (test loss of 0.010, R2 of 0.84 for CNN-LSTM) are dataset-specific and may vary with different training conditions or geographic locations.

## Next Checks
1. Test the three architectures on storm surge data from multiple geographic locations with varying bathymetric characteristics to assess generalizability.
2. Evaluate model performance across multiple extreme weather events beyond Hurricane Ian to verify robustness claims.
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on hyperparameter tuning for each architecture to ensure the comparison reflects optimal configurations rather than specific training setups.
