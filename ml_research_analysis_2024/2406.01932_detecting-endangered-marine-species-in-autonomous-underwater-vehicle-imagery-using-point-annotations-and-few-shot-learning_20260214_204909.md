# Detecting Endangered Marine Species in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Imagery Using Point Annotations and Few-Shot Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.01932
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01932
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Proposed few-shot learning framework improved handfish detection average precision by up to 48% compared to baseline object detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting rare marine species, specifically endangered handfish, in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) imagery. The main problem is the scarcity of training data for these rare species, which reduces detection performance. To overcome this, the authors propose a framework inspired by few-shot learning that leverages annotated images of common marine species to enhance the ability of the detector to identify rare and cryptic species.

The core method involves two key steps: pre-training the detector's backbone using annotated images of common marine species, followed by fine-tuning with the novel class (handfish) data. Additionally, a copy-paste augmentation operation is used to increase the variety of images and reduce domain shift. This operation either copies and pastes the segmented handfish to base class images or copies the segmented base class instances to handfish images.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework for detecting rare marine species in AUV imagery consists of two main steps. First, the detector's backbone is pre-trained using annotated images of common marine species. Second, the model is fine-tuned with data from the novel class (handfish). To address the scarcity of rare species data, a copy-paste augmentation operation is employed. This augmentation can either copy and paste segmented handfish onto images of common species or copy and paste instances of common species onto handfish images, effectively increasing the diversity of training samples and reducing domain shift between common and rare species.

## Key Results
- The proposed framework significantly improved detection performance for rare species, specifically handfish
- Average precision increased by up to 48% compared to baseline object detection training
- Best performance achieved using pre-training and one-way copy-paste of base class instances to novel class images, particularly for the one-stage detector (FCOS) with a novel sample size of 50

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging transfer learning principles and data augmentation to address the scarcity of training data for rare species. Pre-training on common species allows the model to learn general features of marine life, which can then be fine-tuned for the specific task of detecting rare species. The copy-paste augmentation increases the variety of training samples, helping the model generalize better and reducing the domain shift between common and rare species images.

## Foundational Learning
- **Few-shot learning**: Needed to address the challenge of detecting rare species with limited training data. Quick check: Evaluate performance on varying numbers of rare species samples.
- **Transfer learning**: Essential for leveraging knowledge gained from common species to improve rare species detection. Quick check: Compare performance with and without pre-training on common species.
- **Data augmentation**: Crucial for increasing training data diversity and reducing domain shift. Quick check: Assess impact of different augmentation strategies on detection performance.
- **Domain adaptation**: Important for handling the difference between common and rare species image distributions. Quick check: Measure performance on out-of-distribution samples.
- **Object detection in underwater imagery**: Fundamental for the specific application of AUV-based marine species detection. Quick check: Evaluate performance on different underwater environments and conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
AUV imagery -> Pre-trained backbone -> Fine-tuning with rare species data -> Copy-paste augmentation -> Final detector

**Critical path:**
Pre-training on common species -> Fine-tuning on rare species with augmentation -> Evaluation on test set

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Pre-training on common species vs. training from scratch on rare species
- Copy-paste augmentation vs. other augmentation techniques
- One-stage vs. two-stage detector architectures

**Failure signatures:**
- Overfitting to common species features
- Inability to generalize to rare species variations
- Sensitivity to environmental conditions in AUV imagery

**First experiments:**
1. Ablation study on the impact of pre-training vs. training from scratch
2. Comparison of different augmentation strategies (copy-paste vs. traditional methods)
3. Evaluation of framework performance across varying numbers of rare species training samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability of the few-shot learning approach to other rare marine species and underwater environments is unproven
- Reliance on annotated images of common marine species assumes availability of such data, which may not be consistent across different study sites or species groups
- Effectiveness of the copy-paste augmentation strategy for species with different morphologies or camouflage patterns is uncertain

## Confidence
- **High**: Improved detection performance for handfish detection in tested conditions (up to 48% increase in average precision)
- **Medium**: Broader applicability of the framework to other rare species and underwater environments

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional rare and cryptic marine species with varying morphologies and camouflage patterns to assess generalizability.
2. Evaluate performance across different underwater environmental conditions (varying lighting, turbidity, substrate types) to determine robustness.
3. Assess the framework's effectiveness when common species annotations are limited or unavailable in the target study area.
