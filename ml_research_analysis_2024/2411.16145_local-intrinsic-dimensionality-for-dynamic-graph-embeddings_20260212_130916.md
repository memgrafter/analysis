# Local Intrinsic Dimensionality for Dynamic Graph Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.16145
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16145
- **Reference count**: 21
- **Primary result**: NC-LID correlates negatively with dynamic graph embedding quality, identifying nodes with poorly constructed embeddings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate dynamic graph embeddings using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). The authors adapt the NC-LID measure from static graphs to dynamic networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing embedding quality. By computing correlations between NC-LID values and standard embedding quality metrics (precision, recall, F1) across 10 real-world dynamic networks, the study reveals significant negative correlations, suggesting that high NC-LID nodes tend to have weaker embeddings.

## Method Summary
The research proposes adapting NC-LID, originally designed for static graphs, to dynamic networks by computing LID values at each time step and aggregating them. The evaluation methodology involves generating dynamic graph embeddings using dynnode2vec, then measuring the correlation between NC-LID values and embedding quality metrics through link prediction tasks. The study employs Pearson correlation coefficients and Mann-Whitney U tests to statistically validate the relationship between NC-LID and embedding quality across multiple real-world dynamic networks.

## Key Results
- Significant negative correlations between NC-LID and at least one embedding quality metric in majority of networks
- High NC-LID nodes consistently show lower F1 scores compared to low NC-LID nodes
- Mann-Whitney U tests confirm statistically significant differences in F1 scores between high and low NC-LID nodes in 8 out of 10 networks
- Results validate NC-LID as an effective measure for identifying nodes with poorly constructed embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NC-LID measures the local dimensionality of a node's neighborhood in the graph. In dynamic graphs, nodes with high NC-LID values indicate complex, non-linear neighborhood structures that are difficult to embed accurately. When embedding algorithms like dynnode2vec attempt to capture these complex structures in fixed-dimensional vectors, they struggle to maintain the intrinsic relationships, resulting in poor reconstruction performance. The negative correlation between NC-LID and embedding quality metrics emerges because high NC-LID nodes require more complex embeddings to capture their neighborhood structure, which fixed-dimensional embeddings cannot adequately represent.

## Foundational Learning

**Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID)**: Measures the local dimensionality of data points based on their neighborhood structure. *Why needed*: Provides insight into how data points relate to their local neighborhoods in high-dimensional spaces. *Quick check*: LID values typically range from 1 to the ambient dimensionality.

**Dynamic Graph Embeddings**: Techniques that generate node representations that evolve over time as the graph changes. *Why needed*: Static embeddings cannot capture temporal evolution of network structure. *Quick check*: Dynamic embeddings should maintain temporal consistency while adapting to structural changes.

**NC-LID (Neighborhood Component LID)**: Variant of LID that considers the average distance to k-nearest neighbors. *Why needed*: More stable estimation of local dimensionality compared to point-wise LID. *Quick check*: Computed as LID = -1/ln(r_k/r_1) where r_k is distance to k-th neighbor.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dynamic Graph -> Embedding Algorithm (dynnode2vec) -> Node Embeddings -> Link Prediction -> Quality Metrics -> NC-LID Computation -> Correlation Analysis

**Critical Path**: Graph structure at time t -> NC-LID computation -> Embedding generation -> Link prediction evaluation -> Correlation with NC-LID

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using NC-LID provides interpretable quality assessment but requires additional computation. The choice of k=1 for NC-LID balances computational efficiency with stability, though larger k values might provide more robust estimates at increased computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: High NC-LID values without corresponding low embedding quality suggest either noise in LID computation or embeddings that successfully capture complex structures. Conversely, low NC-LID with poor embedding quality indicates embedding algorithms failing on simple structures.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Vary the k parameter in NC-LID computation to assess robustness of correlation results
2. Test multiple dynamic embedding algorithms beyond dynnode2vec to evaluate generalizability
3. Apply NC-LID evaluation to dynamic graphs with different temporal characteristics (bursty vs. gradual changes)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on single dynamic embedding method (dynnode2vec) limits generalizability
- Evaluation based on synthetic link prediction tasks may not reflect all practical use cases
- Selection of 10 networks may not be fully representative of all dynamic network types
- Choice of NC-LID parameters and quality metrics could influence results

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| NC-LID correlates with embedding quality | High |
| NC-LID can identify nodes with weak embeddings | High |
| Methodology for computing NC-LID in dynamic graphs | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the NC-LID correlation with embedding quality across multiple dynamic embedding methods beyond dynnode2vec, including both node2vec-based and GNN-based approaches.

2. Evaluate the relationship between NC-LID and embedding quality on additional real-world dynamic networks with different characteristics (e.g., varying edge densities, community structures).

3. Conduct ablation studies varying the NC-LID computation parameters (k values) and correlation metrics to assess robustness of the observed relationships.
