# Embedding-Space Diffusion for Zero-Shot Environmental Sound Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.03771
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03771
- Reference count: 40
- ZeroDiffusion outperforms generative baselines on average across six environmental sound datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ZeroDiffusion, a diffusion-based method for zero-shot learning in environmental sound classification. The method generates synthetic audio embeddings for unseen classes using a diffusion model conditioned on class auxiliary data, which are then combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier. Experiments on six datasets—ESC-50, ARCA23K-FSD, FSC22, UrbanSound8k, TAU Urban Acoustics 2019, and GTZAN—show that ZeroDiffusion outperforms existing generative methods (CADA-VAE, LisGAN) and the baseline non-linear ALE method on average. The approach is modality-agnostic and provides the first benchmark of generative methods for zero-shot environmental sound classification. Results highlight the potential of diffusion models in this domain, though stability and dataset size remain challenges.

## Method Summary
ZeroDiffusion uses a diffusion model to generate synthetic audio embeddings for unseen classes, conditioned on class semantic embeddings. The process involves training a modified YAMNet model to extract 128-dimensional audio embeddings from seen classes, then training a diffusion network to reconstruct these embeddings when given class embeddings (from Word2Vec with synonyms) as conditioning. During inference, synthetic embeddings for unseen classes are generated and combined with real seen class embeddings to train a non-linear compatibility classifier (ALE) for zero-shot classification.

## Key Results
- ZeroDiffusion outperforms CADA-VAE and LisGAN generative baselines on average across six datasets
- ZeroDiffusion performs competitively with non-linear ALE on most datasets, with better average performance
- Larger datasets (TAU Urban Acoustics 2019) show better results, while smaller datasets (ESC-50, FSC22) exhibit instability
- High variance (7-8%) observed across runs for generative methods, indicating training instability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ZeroDiffusion generates synthetic audio embeddings for unseen classes that match the semantic structure of seen class embeddings.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model is trained on paired audio and class embeddings from seen classes. During training, noise is gradually added to audio embeddings while keeping class embeddings fixed, forcing the model to learn a reconstruction mapping conditioned on class semantics. At inference, unseen class embeddings plus random noise produce realistic synthetic audio embeddings.
- Core assumption: Embedding spaces for audio and class semantics are aligned such that diffusion in one space (audio) can be conditioned on the other (class), preserving semantic relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Synthetic embeddings generated by the diffusion model are combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier."
  - [section] "The input to the network is the noise-injected audio embedding ˜τ (w) concatenated with the class embedding σ(z)."
- Break condition: If the audio and class embedding spaces are misaligned or the conditioning signal is weak, generated embeddings will not represent the unseen class semantics accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The combination of synthetic unseen data with real seen data in a compatibility classifier improves zero-shot generalization.
- Mechanism: After generating synthetic audio embeddings for unseen classes, a non-linear compatibility network is trained on both real seen class data and synthetic unseen class data. This expands the training distribution to include realistic representations of unseen classes, reducing the domain shift between training and test.
- Core assumption: Synthetic embeddings are realistic enough to serve as effective training samples for the classifier, not just as placeholders.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Synthetic embeddings generated by the diffusion model are combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier."
  - [section] "After creating an unseen dataset in this manner, a non-linear compatibility network [31], [48] is trained with both the true seen data and synthetic unseen data."
- Break condition: If synthetic embeddings are too noisy or semantically incorrect, the classifier may overfit to unrealistic patterns and perform worse on true unseen data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diffusion models can operate effectively in embedding space without requiring pre-trained generative models.
- Mechanism: By training a small fully-connected diffusion network directly on embeddings (128-dim audio, 300-dim class), ZeroDiffusion avoids the computational and data requirements of large pre-trained diffusion models. This makes the approach modality-agnostic and lightweight.
- Core assumption: Embedding spaces are compact and information-rich enough that a small diffusion network can capture the generative process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This work establishes the diffusion model as a promising approach for zero-shot learning and introduces the first benchmark of generative methods for zero-shot environmental sound classification..."
  - [section] "Due to the concise and information-rich nature of embeddings, the diffusion architecture is small and uses fully connected layers."
- Break condition: If embeddings are too sparse or the semantic structure is too complex, a small diffusion network may fail to model the data distribution accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word embeddings and semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: Class labels are converted to embeddings (Word2Vec) that capture semantic relationships; these embeddings condition the diffusion model and are used in the compatibility classifier.
  - Quick check question: Why does "lion" embedding lie close to "cat" embedding in Word2Vec space?

- Concept: Audio embeddings from deep networks
  - Why needed here: Raw audio is converted to compact embeddings via a modified YAMNet model; these embeddings are the input to the diffusion model and the compatibility classifier.
  - Quick check question: What layer of YAMNet is used for the embedding, and why?

- Concept: Diffusion model training dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how noise schedules and conditioning affect the generation of synthetic embeddings is key to debugging and improving ZeroDiffusion.
  - Quick check question: How does the epoch percentage p control the noise level in Equation (2)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Modified YAMNet → 128-dim audio embeddings
  - Word2Vec → 300-dim class embeddings (with synonyms)
  - Diffusion model (FC layers) → synthetic audio embeddings for unseen classes
  - Non-linear ALE classifier → zero-shot classification using real + synthetic data

- Critical path:
  1. Train audio embedding model on seen classes
  2. Train diffusion model on seen audio + class embeddings
  3. Generate synthetic embeddings for unseen classes
  4. Train compatibility classifier on real + synthetic data
  5. Evaluate on unseen test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Small diffusion model → fast, lightweight but may underfit complex semantics
  - Large synthetic dataset → better classifier coverage but more compute
  - Non-linear vs linear ALE → higher capacity but more hyperparameters

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance across runs → instability in diffusion or classifier training
  - Low accuracy despite good seen-class performance → poor alignment of embedding spaces
  - Synthetic embeddings look noisy → insufficient diffusion training or bad noise schedule

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train modified YAMNet on ESC-50 seen classes; check embedding quality (visualization, nearest neighbors)
  2. Train diffusion model on ESC-50 seen pairs; generate synthetic embeddings for one unseen class; inspect similarity to real embeddings
  3. Train non-linear ALE on ESC-50 real data only; establish baseline; then add synthetic data and compare accuracy and variance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of ZeroDiffusion scale with dataset size, and is there a minimum number of samples per class required for reliable performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that larger datasets (e.g., TAU 2019 with 1,440 samples per class) yielded better results, while smaller datasets (e.g., ESC-50 with 40 samples per class) showed instability. The authors suggest that dataset size may influence the suitability of zero-shot classification methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of the relationship between dataset size and performance, nor does it identify a specific threshold for minimum samples per class.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying the number of samples per class across different datasets, while keeping other factors constant, would clarify the impact of dataset size on performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the theoretical guarantees for zero-shot learning, and how do they relate to the composition of seen and unseen class sets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that zero-shot learning lacks theoretical foundations and that there is little understanding of upper bounds on accuracy for given sets of unseen and seen classes. It suggests that the composition of these sets may affect the ability to extrapolate information.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the theoretical aspects of zero-shot learning or provide insights into the conditions under which zero-shot learning is feasible or optimal.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing theoretical models or frameworks that define the conditions and limitations of zero-shot learning, possibly through mathematical proofs or empirical studies across diverse datasets, would provide clarity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the stability and consistency of generative methods like ZeroDiffusion be improved to match the reliability of non-generative methods like ALE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that generative methods, including ZeroDiffusion, exhibit higher variance and instability across runs compared to the non-generative ALE method. This inconsistency is identified as a significant challenge for practical applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose specific strategies or techniques to enhance the stability of generative methods, nor does it compare the robustness of different generative approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating techniques such as regularization, ensemble methods, or architectural modifications to reduce variance, along with comparative studies of different generative methods, would help identify ways to improve stability.

## Limitations
- High variance (7-8%) observed across runs for generative methods, indicating training instability
- Performance gap between ZeroDiffusion and non-linear ALE on certain datasets (e.g., GTZAN) raises questions about synthetic data quality
- Reliance on Word2Vec embeddings with manually curated synonym lists introduces potential bias

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using diffusion models to generate synthetic audio embeddings for unseen classes
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that ZeroDiffusion outperforms existing generative methods (CADA-VAE, LisGAN) on average
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that the approach is truly "modality-agnostic" without extensive testing across different embedding types and domains

## Next Checks
1. **Stability Analysis**: Conduct 20+ runs of ZeroDiffusion on ESC-50 to quantify the variance more precisely and identify potential sources of instability in the diffusion training process.

2. **Ablation Study**: Remove the synonym enrichment from Word2Vec embeddings and retrain ZeroDiffusion to assess the impact on performance and determine if the synonym lists are introducing bias or improving semantic alignment.

3. **Synthetic Data Quality**: Generate synthetic embeddings for a held-out seen class (treated as "unseen" during training) and compute quantitative similarity metrics (cosine similarity, MMD) against real embeddings to validate the quality of the generated data.
