# Distributed Event-Based Learning via ADMM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.10618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10618
- Authors: Guner Dilsad Er; Sebastian Trimpe; Michael Muehlebach
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Event-triggered ADMM reduces communication by 35%+ while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an event-based communication strategy for distributed optimization using over-relaxed ADMM. The approach significantly reduces communication overhead by triggering transmissions only when local decision variables change beyond a threshold, while maintaining convergence guarantees even with non-i.i.d. data distributions. The method achieves communication savings of 35% or more compared to standard approaches while achieving similar accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method implements distributed learning using ADMM with an event-triggered communication protocol. Agents perform local updates and only communicate when their decision variables change significantly (beyond threshold Δ). The over-relaxed ADMM with parameter α accelerates convergence, and periodic resets bound accumulated errors. The algorithm is compatible with compression techniques and handles both convex and nonconvex objectives.

## Key Results
- Communication reduction of 35%+ compared to baseline methods
- Maintains similar accuracy to FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and FedADMM
- Outperforms baselines on MNIST and CIFAR-10 with extreme non-i.i.d. data (one class per agent)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Event-triggered communication reduces communication overhead while maintaining convergence
- Mechanism: Agents only communicate when local decision variables deviate significantly (beyond threshold Δ), reducing unnecessary transmissions while bounded error guarantees ensure convergence
- Core assumption: Event-triggered communication errors remain bounded through periodic resets and communication protocol design
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary"
  - [section]: "We reduce the communication load by introducing an event-based communication strategy, such that each agent...communicates only if necessary"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on general ADMM improvements but don't specifically address event-triggered mechanisms
- Break condition: If communication thresholds are set too large, convergence guarantees may fail; if too small, communication savings diminish

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Over-relaxed ADMM with α parameter achieves accelerated convergence rates
- Mechanism: The relaxation parameter α enables faster convergence compared to standard ADMM by modifying the update dynamics, with optimal α∈(0.675,1+√(1-1/√κ)) providing best performance
- Core assumption: Strong convexity of f enables linear convergence rates that can be accelerated
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "derive accelerated convergence rates for the convex case"
  - [section]: "Our method is also compatible with...over-relaxed version of ADMM, where an event-based communication structure between different agents is introduced"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers discuss ADMM acceleration but don't specifically analyze over-relaxation with event-triggered communication
- Break condition: If α is outside the valid range, convergence may fail or degrade significantly

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Algorithm is robust to non-i.i.d. data distributions across agents
- Mechanism: Consensus formulation with local constraints ensures all agents agree on a common solution despite heterogeneous data, preventing local models from diverging
- Core assumption: The consensus constraints xi=z are maintained through dual variables, ensuring global consistency
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct"
  - [section]: "Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication... (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers address federated learning with non-i.i.d. data but don't specifically analyze ADMM-based approaches with event triggering
- Break condition: If data heterogeneity is extreme enough to violate underlying problem assumptions, convergence guarantees may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
  - Why needed here: Forms the optimization backbone for distributed problem solving with convergence guarantees
  - Quick check question: How does ADMM handle the separable objective function in distributed learning problems?

- Concept: Event-triggered control systems
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for reducing communication by triggering updates only when necessary
  - Quick check question: What are the stability conditions for event-triggered systems compared to time-triggered systems?

- Concept: Strong convexity and smoothness conditions
  - Why needed here: Enable linear convergence rates and provide bounds on condition number κ that affects convergence speed
  - Quick check question: How does the condition number κ=L/m affect the convergence rate of ADMM-based algorithms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Agent nodes (N clients) -> Server node (N+1 coordinator) -> Communication channels with event-triggered protocols -> Reset mechanism for bounded error
- Critical path: Local update → Event check → Communication (if triggered) → Server aggregation → Global update → Broadcast back to agents
- Design tradeoffs: Communication threshold Δ vs. solution accuracy, relaxation parameter α vs. convergence speed, reset period T vs. error accumulation
- Failure signatures: Communication load doesn't decrease (thresholds too small), convergence stalls (thresholds too large), accuracy degrades (poor α selection)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Linear regression with synthetic non-i.i.d. data to verify communication reduction vs. FedAvg
  2. MNIST classification with extreme non-i.i.d. (one class per agent) to test robustness
  3. LASSO problem to verify handling of nonsmooth local objectives with event triggering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the event-based communication strategy perform under adversarial attacks or compromised agents in the network?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that the method has not been analyzed with respect to adversarial attacks such as gradient poisoning or unreliable nodes, which could degrade robustness.
- Why unresolved: The current analysis focuses on communication efficiency and convergence under benign conditions but does not address security vulnerabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating the algorithm's resilience or vulnerability to adversarial attacks, or theoretical analysis of robustness guarantees under such conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for choosing the communication threshold ∆ over time to balance convergence speed and communication efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the threshold ∆ affects solution accuracy and that time-varying ∆ = ∆k can ensure convergence, but does not provide optimal strategies for choosing it.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that diminishing thresholds can ensure convergence, it doesn't explore adaptive strategies that could optimize the trade-off dynamically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different adaptive threshold strategies or theoretical bounds on optimal threshold selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the algorithm perform when integrated with compression/quantization techniques for further communication reduction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the method is compatible with compression and quantization techniques but does not explore this integration experimentally.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on event-based communication alone without investigating potential synergies with existing compression methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing communication efficiency and accuracy when combining event-based communication with various compression/quantization schemes.

## Limitations

- The analysis focuses on benign conditions without addressing adversarial attacks or compromised agents
- Optimal strategies for choosing communication thresholds over time are not characterized
- Integration with compression/quantization techniques is suggested but not experimentally validated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of event-triggered communication reducing transmissions while maintaining convergence
- **Medium confidence**: Accelerated convergence rates for convex problems with over-relaxation
- **Medium confidence**: Robustness to non-i.i.d. data distributions

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary Δ and T across different problem scales to characterize the trade-off between communication savings and convergence accuracy
2. **Convergence rate verification**: Compare empirical convergence rates with theoretical bounds for both convex and nonconvex cases across diverse problem types
3. **Baseline implementation validation**: Implement and test all baseline methods (FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedADMM) under identical experimental conditions to ensure fair comparison of communication efficiency metrics
