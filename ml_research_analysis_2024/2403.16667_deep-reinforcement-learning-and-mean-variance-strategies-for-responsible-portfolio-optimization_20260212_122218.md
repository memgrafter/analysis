  for responsible portfolio optimization that incorporates Environmental, Social,

  to use additive or multiplicative utility functions to combine financial objectives
  (Sharpe or Sortino ratios) with ESG objectives in the reward function.

# Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean-Variance Strategies for Responsible Portfolio Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.16667
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16667
- **Authors**: Fernando Acero; Parisa Zehtabi; Nicolas Marchesotti; Michael Cashmore; Daniele Magazzeni; Manuela Veloso
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: DRL policies provide competitive performance against MVO approaches for responsible portfolio allocation with less variability across utility functions.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for responsible portfolio optimization that incorporates Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives alongside financial objectives. The key innovation is using additive or multiplicative utility functions to combine financial objectives (Sharpe or Sortino ratios) with ESG objectives in the reward function. The proposed DRL approach is compared against modified mean-variance optimization (MVO) methods on recent evaluation data spanning the COVID-19 period. Results show that DRL policies achieve competitive annualized financial returns (9.9% to 12.53%) with lower maximum drawdown compared to MVO methods.

## Method Summary
The study combines traditional MVO with DRL for ESG-aware portfolio optimization. MVO Exact uses a quadratic program with additive ESG terms to preserve convexity, while MVO Relaxed employs a relaxed approximation. The DRL approach uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with rewards based on differential Sharpe/Sortino ratios multiplied by ESG performance ratios. The evaluation uses daily price data for 29 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks from 2014-2021, with monthly ESG scores from Sustainalytics. Models are trained on 2014-2019 data and evaluated on 2020-2021 COVID-19 period.

## Key Results
- DRL policies achieved annualized financial returns ranging from 9.9% to 12.53% across various utility functions
- DRL exhibited lower maximum
