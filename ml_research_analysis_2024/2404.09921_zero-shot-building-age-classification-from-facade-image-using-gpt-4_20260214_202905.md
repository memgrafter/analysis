# Zero-shot Building Age Classification from Facade Image Using GPT-4

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09921
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09921
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: GPT-4 Vision achieves 39.69% accuracy and 0.85 MAE on zero-shot building age classification

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the capability of GPT-4 Vision to classify building ages from facade images without any training data, introducing a novel FI-London dataset. The authors demonstrate that GPT-4 can successfully categorize buildings into 15 two-decade epochs through carefully engineered prompts, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.85 decades. While the model performs well on certain periods (1920-1939 and 2000-2019), it struggles with very old buildings and fine-grained predictions within 2 decades.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a new FI-London dataset containing facade images with corresponding building age epochs from London. Using GPT-4 Vision, the authors implement a zero-shot classification approach by designing prompts that guide the model to classify buildings into 15 predefined two-decade epochs. The methodology relies entirely on the model's pre-existing knowledge without any fine-tuning or training on building age data. The classification process involves presenting facade images to GPT-4 with carefully constructed prompts that extract temporal information from architectural features.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 Vision achieved 39.69% accuracy on the FI-London dataset
- Mean absolute error of 0.85 decades indicates successful rough age epoch prediction
- Model performs particularly well on 1920-1939 and 2000-2019 epochs but struggles with very old buildings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GPT-4 Vision leverages its pre-trained knowledge of architectural styles, materials, and design patterns accumulated during training on diverse web data. The model recognizes temporal architectural features such as ornamentation styles, window arrangements, and building materials that correlate with specific historical periods. The zero-shot capability emerges from the model's ability to map visual patterns to temporal contexts without explicit training, demonstrating transfer learning from general visual understanding to specialized domain knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Architectural evolution**: Understanding how building styles change over time is essential for age classification; quick check: review architectural history timelines
- **Zero-shot learning**: The ability to perform classification without training data relies on pre-existing knowledge; quick check: test with completely unseen categories
- **Visual feature extraction**: GPT-4 must identify subtle architectural details that indicate building age; quick check: analyze feature importance in successful classifications

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Facade Image -> GPT-4 Vision API -> Prompt Engineering Module -> Age Classification Output

**Critical Path**: Image input → Vision feature extraction → Prompt-based reasoning → Epoch classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot approach eliminates training costs but sacrifices accuracy compared to supervised methods; single facade images provide efficiency but may lack comprehensive architectural context

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Systematic underestimation of very old buildings
- Inconsistent performance across different decades
- Difficulty with fine-grained distinctions within 2-decade intervals

**First Experiments**:
1. Test model performance on buildings with documented renovation history
2. Evaluate classification accuracy using multiple facade angles per building
3. Compare results with human experts on the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Significant accuracy gap (39.69%) compared to supervised learning approaches
- Systematic bias in predictions, particularly for very old buildings
- Limited generalizability beyond the London architectural context

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GPT-4 Vision can perform zero-shot classification without training data
- **Medium confidence**: The model can predict rough age epochs (2-decade accuracy)
- **Medium confidence**: Performance variation across different time periods is significant
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to other geographic regions beyond London

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on facade images from diverse geographic regions and architectural styles to assess cross-cultural generalizability
2. Evaluate performance using multiple facade images per building to determine if viewing angles and additional context improve accuracy
3. Conduct ablation studies with different prompt engineering approaches to identify optimal zero-shot classification strategies and understand failure modes
