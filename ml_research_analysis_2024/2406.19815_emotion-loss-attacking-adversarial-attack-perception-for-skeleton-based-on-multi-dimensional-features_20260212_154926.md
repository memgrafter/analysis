# Emotion Loss Attacking: Adversarial Attack Perception for Skeleton based on Multi-dimensional Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.19815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19815
- Authors: Feng Liu; Qing Xu; Qijian Zheng
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Proposed method generates adversarial skeleton samples with much lower perturbations and better imperceptibility compared to other methods when perturbation magnitude is the same

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of generating adversarial attacks on skeleton-based action recognition models by proposing a novel method that comprehensively considers dynamic features when measuring distance between skeleton sequences. The authors introduce a dynamic distance function that incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics including bone length, bone angle, and joint speed constraints, while also innovatively using emotional features as complementary information. The constrained optimization problem is solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to generate adversarial samples with superior imperceptibility. Experiments demonstrate that the generated adversarial samples achieve much lower perturbations while maintaining effectiveness against multiple action classifiers.

## Method Summary
The method formulates adversarial attack generation as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to minimize a combined distance function while ensuring attack success. The dynamic distance function measures differences between skeletal motions using bone length preservation, bone angle continuity, and joint speed smoothness as spatial and temporal constraints. Additionally, emotional features extracted from skeletal motions are incorporated to provide complementary information for distance measurement. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed to solve this constrained optimization problem by iteratively updating primal variables and Lagrange multipliers. The approach is evaluated on NTU RGB+D and Kinetics-400 datasets using pre-trained action recognition models (HCN, 2s AGCN, SGN) and a pre-trained emotion classifier.

## Key Results
- The proposed method generates adversarial samples with much lower perturbations (measured by L2 norms) compared to other methods while maintaining the same attack effectiveness
- Dynamic distance function incorporating bone length, angle, and speed constraints significantly improves imperceptibility of adversarial samples
- Emotional features provide complementary information that helps control perception from an overall perspective, though improvements were not as pronounced as expected

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dynamic distance function reduces perceptual distortion by incorporating bone length, angle, and joint speed constraints
- Mechanism: The method uses bone length preservation, bone angle continuity, and joint speed smoothness as optimization objectives to ensure generated adversarial samples remain visually similar to originals
- Core assumption: Preserving these three dynamic features maintains perceptual similarity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose a novel adversarial attack method that uses a dynamic distance function to measure differences between skeletal motions, incorporating spatial and temporal dynamics"
  - [section] "we use bone length as static spatial dynamic constraint" and "we introduce joint's speed as an index of temporal measurement"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citation about perceptual metrics in corpus

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ADMM optimization framework effectively balances classification loss and dynamic constraints
- Mechanism: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers solves the constrained optimization problem by iteratively updating primal variables and Lagrange multipliers to find optimal perturbation
- Core assumption: ADMM convergence guarantees a feasible solution that satisfies both attack and perceptual constraints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we use Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) to solve the constrained optimization problem, which generates adversarial samples with better imperceptibility"
  - [section] "We introduce the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier to solve the dual problem"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about ADMM application to skeleton attacks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Emotional features provide complementary information that improves distance measurement
- Mechanism: Emotion classifier extracts emotional features from skeletal motions, and the distance between original and adversarial samples' emotional representations is minimized to maintain semantic consistency
- Core assumption: Emotional features capture meaningful patterns that correlate with human perception of action similarity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we innovatively introduce emotional features for complementary information"
  - [section] "we innovatively introduce emotions as non-dynamic features to measure the distance"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't contain specific studies on emotion features in skeleton attacks

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: What are the typical degrees of freedom in a skeleton-based action recognition system?

- Concept: Adversarial attack optimization
  - Why needed here: The method formulates attack as a constrained optimization problem requiring understanding of optimization techniques
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between gradient-based and optimization-based adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
  - Why needed here: ADMM is the core algorithm used to solve the constrained optimization problem
  - Quick check question: How does ADMM differ from standard gradient descent in handling constraints?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Original skeleton sequence (joint coordinates over time) → Dynamic Distance Module: Computes bone length, angle, and speed differences → Emotion Feature Extractor: Extracts emotional representations using pre-trained classifier → ADMM Optimizer: Iteratively updates adversarial sample and Lagrange multipliers → Classifier: Target model being attacked (HCN, 2s AGCN, SGN) → Output: Adversarial skeleton sequence with minimal perceptual distortion

- Critical path: Skeleton sequence → Dynamic distance computation → ADMM optimization loop → Adversarial sample generation → Classifier evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Constraint tightness vs. attack success rate: Tighter constraints reduce perceptual distortion but may lower success rate
  - Computational complexity: ADMM requires multiple iterations, increasing runtime
  - Emotion feature accuracy: Depends on pre-trained emotion classifier quality

- Failure signatures:
  - Low attack success rate despite high perturbation magnitude
  - Large bone length or angle deviations indicating constraint violations
  - Oscillating ADMM updates suggesting poor parameter tuning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate dynamic distance computation on synthetic skeleton sequences with known perturbations
  2. Test ADMM convergence on simple constrained optimization problems before applying to full attack
  3. Evaluate emotion feature extraction accuracy on clean skeleton sequences before incorporating into attack pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do emotional features contribute to the measurement of distance between skeletal motions, and what is the impact of incorporating them on the imperceptibility of adversarial samples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces emotional features as complementary information to measure the distance between skeletal motions and states that emotional features can control the perception of adversarial samples from an overall perspective.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that the improvement from emotional features is not obvious, which may be due to the accuracy of the emotion recognizer used. This suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the impact of emotional features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different emotion recognizers or improving the accuracy of the current emotion recognizer to evaluate the impact on imperceptibility.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed dynamic distance function compare to other distance functions in terms of measuring the difference between skeletal motions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a novel dynamic distance function that considers spatial and temporal dynamics, including bone length, bone angle, and joint speed.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that the dynamic distance function is more effective than the l2 distance for skeletal motions, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other distance functions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the proposed dynamic distance function with other distance functions, such as dynamic time warping (DTW) or Euclidean distance, on various datasets and action recognition models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the defense ability of skeleton-based action recognition models be improved to resist adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work will focus on systematically studying how to improve the defense ability of models to resist attacks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any specific methods or techniques to improve the defense ability of models against adversarial attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating various defense techniques, such as adversarial training, defensive distillation, or input preprocessing, to improve the robustness of skeleton-based action recognition models against adversarial attacks.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks ablation studies showing the individual contributions of bone length, angle, speed, and emotional constraints to the reported improvements
- The effectiveness of emotional features as complementary information for attack imperceptibility is speculative without perceptual studies or ablation experiments
- The method's generalizability across diverse skeleton-based models beyond the three evaluated (HCN, 2s AGCN, SGN) remains untested

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
- High confidence: The ADMM optimization framework for constrained adversarial attacks is well-established and correctly applied
- Medium confidence: The dynamic distance function incorporating bone length, angle, and speed constraints is theoretically justified but lacks empirical validation showing these specific metrics correlate with human perception
- Low confidence: The effectiveness of emotional features as complementary information for attack imperceptibility is speculative without perceptual studies or ablation experiments demonstrating their contribution

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing each constraint (bone length, angle, speed, emotion) individually to quantify their specific contributions to attack success rate and imperceptibility metrics
2. Perform human perceptual studies comparing adversarial samples generated with and without emotional features to validate whether emotion-based distance correlates with human judgment of similarity
3. Test the attack across diverse skeleton-based models beyond the three evaluated (HCN, 2s AGCN, SGN) to assess generalizability and identify potential failure modes with different architectures
