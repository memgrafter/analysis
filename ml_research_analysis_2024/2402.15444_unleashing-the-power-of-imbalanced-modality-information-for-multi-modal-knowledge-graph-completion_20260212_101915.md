# Unleashing the Power of Imbalanced Modality Information for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.15444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15444
- Reference count: 9
- Proposed AdaMF-MAT framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMKGC tasks with imbalanced modality information

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) when entities have imbalanced modality information. The authors propose AdaMF-MAT, a novel framework that combines adaptive multi-modal fusion (AdaMF) with modality adversarial training (MAT). AdaMF selectively extracts essential features from different modalities and generates joint embeddings by assigning adaptive weights. MAT employs a generator to create synthetic multi-modal embeddings and construct adversarial examples, enhancing limited multi-modal information during training. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that AdaMF-MAT outperforms 19 recent MMKGC methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

## Method Summary
The AdaMF-MAT framework addresses MMKGC challenges with imbalanced modality information through two key components. Adaptive multi-modal fusion (AdaMF) selectively extracts essential features from different modalities and generates representative joint embeddings by assigning adaptive weights to each modality based on their importance. Modality adversarial training (MAT) employs a generator to create synthetic multi-modal embeddings and construct adversarial examples during training, which helps enhance the limited multi-modal information available. The framework is designed to improve performance particularly in modality-missing scenarios while maintaining strong performance on standard metrics.

## Key Results
- AdaMF-MAT outperforms 19 recent MMKGC methods on three public benchmarks
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on strict metrics like Hit@1
- Demonstrates superior performance in modality-missing scenarios compared to existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing the core challenge of imbalanced modality information through two complementary mechanisms. The adaptive fusion component dynamically weights different modalities based on their relevance and quality, preventing weaker modalities from diluting the overall representation. The adversarial training component generates synthetic examples that help the model learn more robust representations by exposing it to a wider variety of multi-modal patterns during training. Together, these mechanisms allow the model to effectively leverage available modalities while maintaining performance even when some modalities are missing.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Represent entities and relations using information from multiple modalities (text, images, etc.). Why needed: Single-modality approaches miss important contextual information. Quick check: Verify that embeddings can be projected back to individual modalities for interpretability.
- Modality Imbalance Handling: Techniques to manage entities with varying amounts of available modality information. Why needed: Real-world KGs have heterogeneous entity descriptions. Quick check: Test performance degradation as modality information decreases.
- Adversarial Training in Knowledge Graphs: Using generator networks to create synthetic examples for training robustness. Why needed: Limited real training examples with complete multi-modal information. Quick check: Measure improvement in generalization to unseen entity types.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Entity Embeddings -> AdaMF -> Joint Embeddings -> MAT -> Enhanced Embeddings -> Scoring Function -> Triple Predictions

Critical Path:
Raw entity information → Adaptive fusion → Adversarial augmentation → Knowledge graph completion

Design Tradeoffs:
- Adaptive weighting vs. fixed fusion: Adaptive allows better handling of modality quality differences but adds complexity
- Synthetic data generation vs. real data reliance: Synthetic examples help with imbalance but may introduce noise
- Generator architecture complexity vs. training stability: More complex generators create better examples but risk training instability

Failure Signatures:
- Over-reliance on dominant modality: Model performance drops significantly when that modality is missing
- Adversarial example collapse: Generator produces unrealistic synthetic examples that hurt performance
- Weight instability: Adaptive weights oscillate during training, causing inconsistent predictions

First Experiments:
1. Test adaptive weighting sensitivity by comparing with fixed-weight baselines
2. Evaluate synthetic example quality by measuring nearest neighbors in embedding space
3. Assess modality-missing performance by systematically removing modalities from test entities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed ablation studies to isolate contributions of AdaMF and MAT components
- Limited experimental setup and dataset descriptions make robustness assessment difficult
- Insufficient validation across different scenarios and data distributions

## Confidence
High: State-of-the-art results on three benchmarks
Medium: Performance improvements on strict metrics like Hit@1
Medium: Claims about modality-missing scenario performance

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of AdaMF and MAT to overall performance
2. Perform experiments on additional benchmarks with varying levels of modality imbalance to test generalization
3. Analyze model performance on out-of-distribution data and with noisy or missing modality information to assess robustness
