# Quick and Accurate Affordance Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.07816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07816
- Reference count: 14
- The model combines a cognitive map for navigation with local affordance learning, using Jensen-Shannon divergence for balanced exploration

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep learning model that learns affordances through active exploration in a simulated environment. The key innovation is coordinating navigation behavior with local motor control while using information-theoretic uncertainty measures to guide exploration. The model successfully learns how different environmental conditions affect agent behavior by focusing on epistemic uncertainty while avoiding aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the environment.

## Method Summary
The model consists of two main components: an affordance model that predicts how environmental conditions affect motor behavior, and a transition model that predicts positional changes. The agent explores using three uncertainty measures (aleatoric uncertainty, EUSD, and JSD), with JSD showing the most balanced exploration strategy. Local sensory encoding is used to enable generalization to new environments. The system is trained end-to-end on position/action sequences in a 2D physics simulation with various terrain types.

## Key Results
- JSD-guided exploration outperforms aleatoric and EUSD measures for balanced exploration
- Local sensory encoding enables better generalization to new environments compared to global encoding
- The model successfully learns to coordinate navigation with local motor behavior for effective affordance learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) guided exploration balances epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty more effectively than alternatives
- Mechanism: JSD measures disagreement across ensemble models, isolating epistemic uncertainty while avoiding regions of high aleatoric uncertainty
- Core assumption: Aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced through learning and should be avoided during exploration
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states JSD exhibits the most balanced exploration strategy; section confirms EUJSD is most suitable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local sensory encoding improves generalization by avoiding overfitting to absolute spatial coordinates
- Mechanism: Limiting sensor range forces the agent to learn relative, context-dependent affordances rather than memorizing specific locations
- Core assumption: Affordances are inherently local phenomena that should not depend on absolute position
- Evidence anchors: Section states local sensory information is used and agents learn only egocentrically encoded knowledge

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Coordinating navigation behavior with local motor behavior enables effective affordance learning
- Mechanism: The agent uses a cognitive map to plan movements while the affordance model conditions motor predictions on local sensory context
- Core assumption: Navigation and motor control must be tightly integrated for learning to occur efficiently
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states navigation needs to be coordinated with local motor behavior; section describes architecture mediating between global exploration and local learning

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Why needed here: The agent-environment interaction is modeled as an MDP where observations lead to actions that influence future states
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes an MDP from a simple state machine in this context?

- Concept: Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The agent must distinguish between uncertainty that can be reduced through learning (epistemic) and uncertainty inherent in the environment (aleatoric)
  - Quick check question: Why would focusing exploration on aleatoric uncertainty be counterproductive?

- Concept: Information-theoretic divergence measures
  - Why needed here: JSD and KL divergence quantify differences between probability distributions, enabling measurement of epistemic uncertainty across ensemble models
  - Quick check question: What property of JSD makes it particularly suitable for comparing multiple model predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visual representation → Context encoding → Prediction → Uncertainty evaluation → Action selection
- Critical path: Visual representation → Context encoding → Prediction → Uncertainty evaluation → Action selection
- Design tradeoffs: Local vs global sensory encoding (generalization vs absolute positioning), single model vs ensemble (computational cost vs uncertainty estimation quality)
- Failure signatures: Poor generalization (overfitting to training environment), getting stuck in regions of high aleatoric uncertainty, failure to coordinate navigation with motor behavior
- First 3 experiments: 1) Compare aleatoric, EUSD, and JSD exploration strategies, 2) Test local vs global sensory encoding for generalization, 3) Evaluate coordination between navigation and motor behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas remain unexplored:
- The optimal size of the ensemble for epistemic uncertainty estimation using JSD is not discussed
- The model's performance in more complex, high-dimensional environments is unknown
- The model is not compared to other active learning strategies in terms of sample efficiency and convergence speed

## Limitations

- Claims about JSD superiority rely on results from a single simulated environment without statistical significance testing
- Generalization claims are based on transfer to structurally similar environments, not fundamentally different ones
- The local sensory encoding approach may not generalize to real-world scenarios where absolute positioning is crucial

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The local sensory encoding improving generalization claim (well-supported by ablation studies)
- **Medium Confidence**: The coordination between navigation and motor behavior claim (conceptually sound but limited empirical validation)
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority of JSD over other uncertainty measures (supported by results but limited to one environment type)

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical Validation**: Perform hypothesis testing on the performance differences between exploration strategies across multiple random seeds to establish statistical significance of JSD's superiority
2. **Environment Transferability**: Test the model's ability to generalize to fundamentally different environment structures (e.g., 3D spaces, non-grid layouts) beyond the 2D grid used in the study
3. **Real-world Feasibility**: Evaluate the local encoding approach in scenarios where absolute positioning matters, such as navigation tasks requiring precise location awareness, to identify potential failure modes
