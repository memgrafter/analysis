# Enhancing Authorship Attribution through Embedding Fusion: A Novel Approach with Masked and Encoder-Decoder Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00411
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Classification accuracy >96% and MCC >0.93 on authorship attribution tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for authorship attribution that leverages embedding fusion from multiple pre-trained language models (PLMs). By combining semantic information from Masked Language Models (MLMs) and Encoder-Decoder Language Models (EDLMs), the approach reshapes embeddings into 2D representations and feeds them into a CNN-based classifier. The method demonstrates strong performance on both Human vs LLM text classification and Deepfake text detection tasks, with classification accuracy exceeding 96% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient above 0.93.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates embeddings from multiple PLMs, specifically focusing on MLM and EDLM architectures, to capture diverse semantic information. The embeddings are reshaped into a 2D representation, which is then processed by a CNN-based classifier. This fusion approach aims to leverage the complementary strengths of different PLM types, with experimental results showing that combining MLM and EDLM embeddings yields the best performance. Notably, the inclusion of Autoregressive Language Model (ALM) embeddings was found to potentially degrade performance in the tested scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieved classification accuracy greater than 96% on authorship attribution tasks
- Obtained Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) greater than 0.93
- Demonstrated that combining MLM and EDLM embeddings is most effective, while ALM embeddings may degrade performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by fusing embeddings from complementary PLM architectures, allowing the model to capture a broader range of semantic and stylistic features. MLMs excel at understanding context bidirectionally, while EDLMs provide strong encoding and decoding capabilities. By reshaping these embeddings into 2D representations and processing them through CNNs, the framework can effectively identify authorship patterns that might be missed by individual PLM types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Masked Language Models (MLMs)**: Bidirectional context understanding - why needed: captures nuanced semantic relationships; quick check: verify bidirectional context is captured
- **Encoder-Decoder Language Models (EDLMs)**: Strong encoding and decoding capabilities - why needed: provides complementary information to MLMs; quick check: ensure both encoding and decoding are utilized
- **Embedding Fusion**: Combining multiple embedding sources - why needed: leverages diverse PLM strengths; quick check: validate fusion improves over individual models
- **2D Reshaping of Embeddings**: Converting embeddings for CNN processing - why needed: enables spatial feature extraction; quick check: confirm reshaping preserves information
- **CNN-based Classification**: Spatial pattern recognition - why needed: effectively processes 2D reshaped embeddings; quick check: compare with alternative architectures

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Text -> MLM + EDLM -> Embedding Fusion -> 2D Reshaping -> CNN Classifier -> Authorship Attribution
**Critical Path**: The embedding fusion and 2D reshaping steps are critical, as they directly impact the quality of information passed to the CNN classifier
**Design Tradeoffs**: Fusing multiple PLM types increases computational complexity but potentially improves accuracy; reshaping to 2D assumes spatial patterns are meaningful
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate ineffective fusion, loss of information during reshaping, or suboptimal CNN architecture
**First Experiments**:
1. Test individual MLM and EDLM embeddings before fusion to establish baseline performance
2. Experiment with different 2D reshaping strategies to optimize information preservation
3. Compare CNN classifier performance against transformer-based or attention-based alternatives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to specific datasets (Human vs LLM text and Deepfake text detection)
- Does not report cross-domain validation results
- Relies on CNN architecture without exploring alternatives
- ALM exclusion benefits may be dataset-specific

## Confidence
- **Generalizability of approach**: Medium - Strong results on tested datasets, but limited cross-domain validation
- **Superiority of MLM+EDLM fusion**: High - Clear performance improvement demonstrated
- **Degradation by ALM embeddings**: Medium - Based on limited ablation studies, may be dataset-dependent

## Next Checks
1. Test the embedding fusion approach on diverse authorship attribution datasets, including cross-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, to assess generalizability
2. Compare the CNN-based classifier with transformer-based or attention-based models to determine if the 2D reshaping step is optimal for the fused embeddings
3. Conduct ablation studies to identify which specific features from MLM and EDLM embeddings contribute most to performance, and test the inclusion of ALM embeddings in varied contexts
