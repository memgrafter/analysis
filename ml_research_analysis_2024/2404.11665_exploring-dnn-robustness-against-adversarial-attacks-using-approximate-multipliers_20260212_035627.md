# Exploring DNN Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks Using Approximate Multipliers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11665
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11665
- Reference count: 21
- This study shows approximate multipliers can improve DNN robustness against adversarial attacks by up to 10% while maintaining a maximum 7% accuracy drop

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the use of approximate multipliers to enhance deep neural network (DNN) robustness against adversarial attacks. The authors introduce state-of-the-art approximate multipliers into the AdaPT framework, which enables fast cross-layer evaluation of DNN models. By uniformly replacing accurate multipliers with approximate ones, the study demonstrates that robustness can be improved while maintaining reasonable accuracy levels across different architectures and datasets.

## Method Summary
The researchers use the AdaPT framework to evaluate DNN robustness by replacing accurate multipliers with approximate ones across all model layers. They pre-train three DNN architectures (LeNet-5, ResNet-50, and VGG-19) on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, then quantize parameters to 8-bit integers. Three white-box adversarial attacks (FGSM, BIM, and PGD) with perturbation budgets ranging from 0 to 2 are used to evaluate the models' robustness against the approximate multipliers.

## Key Results
- Approximate multipliers improved robust accuracy by up to 10% against adversarial attacks
- Maximum accuracy drop of 7% when no attack is present due to approximations
- Results were consistent across three DNN architectures (LeNet-5, ResNet-50, VGG-19) and two datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Uniform replacement of accurate multipliers with approximate multipliers in DNN layers improves robustness against adversarial attacks while slightly reducing baseline accuracy
- Mechanism: Approximate multipliers introduce noise-like perturbations in internal computations that act as regularization, making networks less sensitive to small input perturbations used in adversarial attacks
- Core assumption: DNNs are inherently resilient to certain types of computational noise, which can be leveraged to improve robustness against adversarial attacks
- Evidence anchors: Results show up to 7% accuracy drop due to approximations when no attack is present while improving robust accuracy up to 10% when attacks applied

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The AdaPT framework enables fast exploration of DNN robustness against adversarial attacks by using approximate multipliers in a multi-threaded and vectorized environment
- Mechanism: AdaPT uses a Look-up Table (LUT) generator to precompute approximate multiplication results, avoiding slow floating-point operations, and replaces accurate multiplications with approximate ones across all layers
- Core assumption: The AdaPT framework accurately emulates DNN behavior with approximate multipliers for reliable robustness evaluation
- Evidence anchors: AdaPT supports any bit width and can be used for various DNN models

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using different adversarial attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD) with varying perturbation budgets allows comprehensive evaluation of DNN robustness
- Mechanism: Different attacks with different perturbation budgets assess robustness under various attack scenarios, providing complete understanding of approximate multiplier effectiveness
- Core assumption: The chosen adversarial attacks are representative of real-world scenarios and provide comprehensive evaluation
- Evidence anchors: Three white-box attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD) are considered for evaluation of adversarial robustness

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained DNN models -> AdaPT framework (with approximate multipliers) -> Adversarial attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD) -> Robustness evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Pre-train DNN models 2. Quantize parameters to 8-bit integers 3. Replace accurate multipliers with approximate ones using AdaPT 4. Evaluate accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. robustness (approximate multipliers improve robustness but may reduce baseline accuracy), Hardware efficiency vs. accuracy (approximate multipliers improve efficiency but may introduce noise), Evaluation time vs. comprehensiveness (AdaPT allows fast evaluation but may not capture all behaviors)
- Failure signatures: Significant accuracy degradation without attacks, failure to improve robustness against attacks, inability to accurately emulate DNN behavior using AdaPT
- First 3 experiments: 1. Evaluate accuracy of LeNet-5, ResNet-50, and VGG-19 with and without approximate multipliers on MNIST and CIFAR-10 2. Evaluate robustness of same models against FGSM, BIM, and PGD attacks with varying perturbation budgets 3. Compare results to determine impact of approximate multipliers on DNN robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions approximate multipliers aim to save computational resources but lacks quantitative analysis
- Why unresolved: Study focuses on accuracy and robustness without delving into energy efficiency and hardware implementation aspects
- What evidence would resolve it: Performing detailed hardware implementation and energy efficiency analysis to quantify trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and resource savings

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does choice of perturbation budget (ε) affect trade-off between robustness improvement and accuracy loss in DNN models using approximate multipliers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper explores different perturbation budgets but doesn't provide comprehensive analysis of relationship between ε and trade-off
- Why unresolved: Study presents results for various perturbation budgets but doesn't investigate optimal ε that balances robustness improvement and accuracy loss
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting systematic study to determine optimal perturbation budget that maximizes robustness improvement while minimizing accuracy loss

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three DNN architectures and two datasets, which may not generalize to all models
- AdaPT framework's emulation may not capture all hardware-level effects of approximate multipliers
- Focus on white-box attacks only, potentially missing important black-box attack scenarios
