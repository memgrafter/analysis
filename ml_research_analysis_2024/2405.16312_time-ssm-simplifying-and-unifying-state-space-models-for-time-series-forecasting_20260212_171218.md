## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for applying State Space Models (SSMs) to time series forecasting, introducing the concept of Dynamic Spectral Operators. The authors develop Time-SSM, a foundation model with only one-seventh the parameters of Mamba, using a novel Hippo-LegP basis based on piecewise Legendre polynomials. Experimental results demonstrate that Time-SSM outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on multiple real-world time series datasets. The study reveals several key insights, including the effectiveness of S4D-real initialization for TSF tasks, the robustness of diagonal SSMs in noisy time series data, and the importance of the unitary matrix in complex-plane SSMs for temporal modeling.

## Method Summary
Time-SSM is a foundation model for time series forecasting that builds on State Space Models with several key innovations. The model uses S4D-real initialization, which provides optimal performance by balancing model complexity and noise robustness. It employs complex-plane SSMs with a unitary matrix V that serves as an inductive bias for temporal modeling. The model also utilizes a novel Hippo-LegP basis based on piecewise Legendre polynomials for stronger representational capacity. Time-SSM features a two-layer architecture with state space dimension of 64, hidden dimension of 256, and patch length/stride of 16. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with learning rates ranging from 0.0001 to 0.001, and evaluated using MSE and MAE metrics across multiple prediction horizons.

## Key Results
- Time-SSM achieves an average MSE of 0.426 on the ETTh1 dataset, outperforming Mamba4TS, Koopa, and RWKV-TS
- S4D-real initialization provides superior performance and robustness compared to full-rank initialization methods
- Complex-plane SSMs with unitary matrix V demonstrate better temporal modeling capabilities than purely real-domain approaches
- Hippo-LegP basis shows stronger representational capacity than uniform bases, particularly for non-stationary time series data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diagonal initialization (S4D-real) provides optimal performance for time series forecasting by balancing model complexity and noise robustness
- Mechanism: Diagonal SSMs approximate complex dynamics with a simpler structure that is less sensitive to noise in real-world time series data
- Core assumption: Time series data contains significant noise that degrades performance of full-rank SSMs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "S4D-real initialization is particularly effective for TSF tasks"
  - [section]: "Surprisingly, Table 3 reveal that rough dynamic approximations, such as S4D-real, actually yield better performance"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in related papers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The unitary matrix V in complex-plane SSMs serves as an inductive bias for temporal modeling
- Mechanism: V enables ABC to possess coordinated dynamics by conjugating diagonalization from real to complex plane
- Core assumption: Complex-domain representation provides stronger expressive power for temporal dynamics
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the unitary matrix V serves as an important inductive bias for temporal modeling"
  - [section]: "Directly initializing the imaginary part ℑ(LinearBC (u)) = 0 leads to significant performance degradation"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on different aspects of SSMs

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Piecewise Legendre polynomial basis (Hippo-LegP) provides stronger representational capacity for time series
- Mechanism: Multi-scale approximation through piecewise segmentation captures non-stationary dynamics better than uniform bases
- Core assumption: Real-world time series exhibit non-uniform dynamic characteristics along the time axis
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we introduce a novel variant of SSM basis called Hippo-LegP based on piecewise Legendre polynomials"
  - [section]: "LegP exhibits stronger representational capacity but is susceptible to noise in TSF tasks"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in related papers

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input patch embedding → SSM layers with time-varying parameters → Variable kernel module → Output linear projection
- Critical path: Input → Patch embedding → SSM layers → Variable kernel → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Real vs. complex plane SSMs: Performance vs. computational complexity
  - Time-varying vs. time-invariant parameters: Expressiveness vs. robustness
  - Full-rank vs. diagonal matrices: Accuracy vs. noise sensitivity
- Failure signatures:
  - Gradient explosion: Indicates need for diagonalization or S4D-real initialization
  - Performance degradation with longer sequences: May require piecewise scaling or multi-scale approaches
  - Overfitting on small datasets: Suggests reducing model complexity or using regularization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare S4D-real initialization vs. full-rank initialization on a small time series dataset
  2. Test real-plane vs. complex-plane SSMs with identical architectures
  3. Evaluate Hippo-LegP vs. Hippo-LegT on datasets with varying levels of noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the mathematical justification for the superior performance of S4D-real initialization in TSF tasks compared to other initialization methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that S4D-real initialization is particularly effective for TSF tasks and remains the simplest and most effective choice, but lacks rigorous mathematical proof.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides empirical evidence of S4D-real's effectiveness, it acknowledges the absence of a rigorous mathematical proof explaining why this initialization method outperforms others in TSF tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal mathematical proof demonstrating why S4D-real initialization leads to better performance in TSF tasks compared to other initialization methods, potentially through theoretical analysis of the convergence properties or stability of the SSM system under this initialization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Hippo-LegP framework be extended to work with Hippo-LegS, which employs an exponential decay approximation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that Hippo-LegP is built upon a finite measure approximation and shows superior performance compared to Hippo-LegT, but does not explore its applicability to Hippo-LegS.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Hippo-LegP but does not investigate whether this framework can be adapted to work with exponential decay approximations like those used in Hippo-LegS.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of a modified Hippo-LegP framework applied to Hippo-LegS against the original Hippo-LegS and other SSM variants in various TSF tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the dynamic spectral operators adapt to different types of non-stationarity in real-world time series data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the concept of Dynamic Spectral Operators and mentions their ability to adapt to temporal dynamics, but does not provide a detailed analysis of their behavior in the presence of various non-stationary patterns.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes the Dynamic Spectral Operator theory and demonstrates its effectiveness, it does not thoroughly investigate how these operators specifically handle different types of non-stationarity commonly found in real-world time series data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study analyzing the performance of Time-SSM with Dynamic Spectral Operators on time series datasets exhibiting various types of non-stationarity (e.g., trend changes, seasonality shifts, abrupt changes) and comparing its adaptability to other state-of-the-art TSF models.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework relies heavily on continuous-time assumptions that may not fully translate to practical implementations
- Performance gains from S4D-real initialization and complex-plane V matrices lack rigorous theoretical justification
- Piecewise Legendre basis shows promise but its noise sensitivity raises questions about scalability to real-world applications

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims:**
- Time-SSM achieves superior performance metrics on benchmark datasets compared to Mamba4TS and other baselines
- S4D-real initialization consistently provides robust performance across different time series datasets
- Complex-plane SSMs with unitary matrix V offer advantages for temporal modeling over purely real-domain approaches

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The Dynamic Spectral Operator framework provides a unifying perspective for various SSM formulations
- Piecewise Legendre polynomials offer better representational capacity than uniform bases for non-stationary time series
- The variable kernel module effectively captures cross-variable relationships in multivariate time series

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The theoretical guarantees of orthogonal basis projections extend seamlessly to discrete-time implementations
- The specific choice of patch length (16) and stride is optimal for all time series datasets
- The two-layer architecture is sufficient for capturing long-range dependencies in all scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary noise levels in synthetic time series data to quantify the robustness of S4D-real initialization versus full-rank SSMs, directly testing the claimed mechanism for noise robustness.

2. **Complex Plane Computational Overhead**: Benchmark the computational and memory costs of complex-plane SSMs with unitary matrix V against real-plane alternatives across different sequence lengths, validating the claimed trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency.

3. **Generalization Across Domains**: Test Time-SSM on time series datasets from domains not included in the original evaluation (e.g., medical time series, sensor networks, financial markets) to assess the universality of the claimed advantages and identify potential failure modes in specialized applications.
