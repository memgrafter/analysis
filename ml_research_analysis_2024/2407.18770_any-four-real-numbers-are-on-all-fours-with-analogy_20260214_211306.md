# Any four real numbers are on all fours with analogy

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18770
- Reference count: 40
- For any four positive real numbers arranged in increasing order, there exists a unique power p such that the generalized mean of the extremes equals the generalized mean of the means

## Executive Summary
This paper formalizes analogy between numbers using generalized means parameterized by a power p. It establishes that for any four positive real numbers in increasing order, there exists a unique p that defines an analogy. The framework unifies classical arithmetic and geometric analogies as special cases and extends to complex numbers. The authors demonstrate that any analogy can be reduced to an arithmetic analogy through power transformations, and prove that analogical equations are always solvable over complex numbers.

## Method Summary
The method defines analogy in power p using generalized means: for four positive real numbers a < b < c < d, there exists a unique p such that mp(a,d) = mp(b,c), where mp(x,y) = [(xp + yp)/2]^(1/p). The existence and uniqueness of p is proven using the intermediate value theorem on the continuous function δ(p) = mp(a,d) - mp(b,c). The framework shows that any analogy in power p can be reduced to an arithmetic analogy by raising all terms to power p, and that analogical equations of the form A:B::p C:x are always solvable over complex numbers.

## Key Results
- Any four increasing positive real numbers form an analogy in a unique suitable power p
- Any analogy in power p can be reduced to an equivalent arithmetic analogy
- Any analogical equation A:B::p C:x is solvable over complex numbers
- Classical arithmetic and geometric analogies are special cases of this unified framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: For any four positive real numbers arranged in increasing order, there exists a unique power parameter p that defines an analogy.
- Mechanism: The function δ(p) = lim(r→p) [(ar + dr)/2]^(1/r) - lim(r→p) [(br + cr)/2]^(1/r) is continuous and strictly increasing, with negative limit as p→-∞ and positive limit as p→+∞. By the intermediate value theorem, δ(p) must cross zero exactly once.
- Core assumption: The four numbers are all different and ordered as a < b < c < d.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "any four increasing positive real numbers is an analogy in a unique suitable power"
  - [section 3.6]: "Given four terms a, b, c and d, positive and ordered in ascending order, there exist a unique p for which there is an analogy between these terms"
- Break condition: If any two numbers are equal, the uniqueness of p is lost. If the numbers are not ordered with extremes framing the means, no such p exists.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Any analogy in power p can be reduced to an equivalent arithmetic analogy.
- Mechanism: By raising all terms to the power p, an analogy in power p transforms into an arithmetic analogy. This works because mp(a,d) = mp(b,c) implies ap + dp = bp + cp, which is the arithmetic analogy definition.
- Core assumption: p ≠ 0 (for the power transformation method).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "Any analogy in power p, with p different from -∞ or +∞, can be transposed into an arithmetic analogy"
  - [section 3.3]: "a : b ::p c : d ⇔ ap : bp ::1 cp : dp"
- Break condition: The transformation fails for p = 0, where the geometric mean applies instead.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Any analogical equation of the form A : B ::p C : x is solvable over complex numbers.
- Mechanism: For any given p and complex numbers A, B, C (all non-zero), there exists a unique complex solution x that satisfies the analogy equation. This extends the solvability from real numbers to the complex plane.
- Core assumption: The terms are complex numbers excluding zero.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "any analogical equation has a solution for increasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers"
  - [section 4.1]: "∀p ∈ R, ∀(a, b, c) ∈ C \ {0}, ∃x ∈ C \ {0} : a : b ::p c : x"
- Break condition: If any term equals zero, the analogy becomes undefined due to division by zero or zero raised to negative powers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generalized means and their properties
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on understanding how generalized means behave across different power parameters, including edge cases at 0 and ±∞
  - Quick check question: What is the limit of mp(a,d) as p→0, and how does this relate to the geometric mean?

- Concept: Intermediate Value Theorem application
  - Why needed here: The existence proof for unique p relies on showing that a continuous function changes sign between -∞ and +∞, guaranteeing at least one root
  - Quick check question: Why does the strict ordering a < b < c < d ensure that δ(-∞) < 0 and δ(+∞) > 0?

- Concept: Equivalence relations and their properties
  - Why needed here: Understanding reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of the ::p relation is crucial for establishing the mathematical foundation
  - Quick check question: Which of the three properties (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity) does not generally hold for :: in the classical sense but does hold for ::p?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Four real or complex numbers (a, b, c, d)
  - Core engine: Generalized mean calculator with power parameter p
  - Solver module: Binary search or numerical method to find p where mp(a,d) = mp(b,c)
  - Reducer: Power transformation to convert any analogy to arithmetic form
  - Validator: Checks for edge cases (equality, ordering, zero values)

- Critical path:
  1. Receive four numbers as input
  2. Check ordering and handle reordering if necessary
  3. Compute generalized means across a range of p values
  4. Find intersection point using numerical methods
  5. Validate uniqueness of solution
  6. Apply reduction to canonical form if needed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. performance: Higher precision in finding p increases computation time
  - Real vs. complex number support: Complex support adds computational complexity but enables broader applications
  - General p vs. specific cases: Handling p = 0, ±∞ separately simplifies some calculations but requires special-case code

- Failure signatures:
  - No solution found: Indicates input numbers don't satisfy the framing condition (extremes must bracket means)
  - Multiple solutions found: Suggests input numbers have equality relationships that violate uniqueness
  - Division by zero errors: Occurs when zero values are present in denominators
  - Overflow/underflow: Happens with extreme values during power calculations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the solver with simple arithmetic analogy (a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4) and verify p=1 is found
  2. Test with geometric analogy (a=1, b=2, c=4, d=8) and verify p=0 is found
  3. Test edge case with equality (a=1, b=1, c=2, d=2) and verify that any p works

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can analogy in power p be extended to cases where terms have mixed signs (some positive, some negative)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses analogy with negative numbers in Section 5.1 but identifies this as an open problem, noting that while some cases can be handled, cases with only one negative number or mixed signs between means and extremes remain unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that analogy can be extended to all negative numbers through transformation rules, but cases where means are negative while extremes are positive (or vice versa) are not addressed, and the mathematical framework for handling these cases is not established.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing whether analogy in power p exists for all mixed-sign configurations, or identification of specific constraints under which it fails, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can non-real (complex) powers be used to capture all possible reorderings of analogy terms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 discusses the possibility of using complex numbers for powers or terms to handle reordering, noting that for three possible orderings (a:b::c:d, a:c::d:b, a:d::b:c), complex powers might be necessary to enforce analogy across all configurations.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a system of equations suggesting complex powers might be needed but does not solve for these powers or determine whether real numbers would suffice, leaving the existence and form of such complex powers as an open mathematical problem.
- What evidence would resolve it: Explicit calculation of the complex powers q and r that would satisfy the analogy equations for the two non-standard orderings, or proof that real numbers cannot satisfy these equations, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the semantic meaning of the power parameter p in the analogy a:b::p c:d?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion (Section 6) raises this question, noting that p "summarizes the information implicit in a, b, c and d" but the semantic interpretation of this parameter remains unexplored.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes that p exists and is unique for ordered positive terms, and that it can be calculated numerically, it does not provide any interpretation of what p represents in terms of the relationship between the four numbers beyond being a mathematical parameter that makes the generalized means equal.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework connecting the value of p to geometric, algebraic, or statistical properties of the four numbers, or empirical studies showing how p relates to meaningful properties in applications like machine learning embeddings, would provide semantic meaning to this parameter.

## Limitations
- Theoretical assumptions: The framework assumes all four numbers are positive and ordered, which may limit practical applicability
- Computational complexity: Finding the unique power p requires numerical methods, introducing approximation errors and computational overhead
- Edge case handling: Special cases at p = 0, p = -∞, and p = +∞ require separate treatment, adding complexity to implementation

## Confidence
- High confidence: Existence and uniqueness proof for positive real numbers with strict ordering
- Medium confidence: Extension to complex numbers and practical implementation details
- Medium confidence: Reduction to arithmetic analogy and handling of special cases

## Next Checks
1. **Numerical stability test**: Implement the generalized mean solver and test with various input combinations, including edge cases where terms are close in value or span multiple orders of magnitude. Measure convergence accuracy and computational time.

2. **Complex number verification**: Extend the implementation to complex numbers and verify that for any non-zero complex inputs, a unique solution p exists. Test with both purely real and genuinely complex values.

3. **Analogical equation solver**: Implement the solver for equations of the form A:B::p C:x and validate that it correctly finds solutions across different values of p, including the special cases.
