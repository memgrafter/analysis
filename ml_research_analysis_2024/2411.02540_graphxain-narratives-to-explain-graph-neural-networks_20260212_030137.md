# GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.02540
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02540
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: GraphXAIN generates natural language narratives to explain GNN predictions, improving interpretability and user comprehension.

## Executive Summary
GraphXAIN introduces a novel method for explaining Graph Neural Network (GNN) predictions by translating technical outputs into coherent, story-like narratives using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach takes explanatory subgraphs and feature importance scores from GNNExplainer and generates human-readable explanations that contextualize the model's decision-making process. Evaluated on NBA players and IMDB movies datasets, GraphXAIN demonstrates significant improvements in explainability dimensions including understandability, satisfaction, convincingness, and communicability. The method is model- and explainer-agnostic, making it broadly applicable across various graph-structured data scenarios.

## Method Summary
GraphXAIN operates as a post-hoc explanation framework that bridges the gap between complex GNN reasoning and human comprehension. The method requires three inputs: the original graph data, a trained GNN model's prediction for a target node, and the explainer's output (subgraph + feature importance scores). An LLM is prompted with this information to generate a narrative explanation that contextualizes the technical outputs in a cause-and-effect manner. The framework is designed to be agnostic to both the underlying GNN architecture and the explainer method used, requiring only that the explainer provides feature importances and a relevant subgraph. The LLM prompt is carefully constructed to guide the generation of coherent narratives that connect features and nodes through relationships rather than presenting static feature values.

## Key Results
- GraphXAIN improves four explainability dimensions: understandability, satisfaction, convincingness, and communicability in user studies
- When combined with technical explanations, GraphXAIN further improves trustworthiness, insightfulness, confidence, and usability
- 95% of machine learning researchers and practitioners found GraphXAIN to be a valuable addition to GNN explanation methods
- The method demonstrates effectiveness on both classification (NBA players) and regression (IMDB movies) tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based narrative generation improves user comprehension of GNN decisions by translating technical graph explanations into human-readable stories.
- Mechanism: GraphXAIN takes the subgraph and feature importance scores produced by GNNExplainer and feeds them into an LLM prompt. The LLM is guided to produce a coherent narrative that contextualizes these features in a cause-and-effect manner, rather than listing them statically.
- Core assumption: Users can better understand GNN decisions when they are framed as stories that connect features and nodes through relationships, not just isolated facts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GraphXAIN is a model- and explainer-agnostic method that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate explanatory subgraphs and feature importance scores into coherent, story-like explanations of GNN decision-making processes."
  - [section] "Unlike other GNN XAI descriptive outputs, which typically present static feature values, the outputs generated by our method provide a coherent XAI Narrative."
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to maintain coherence or if the subgraph lacks meaningful connections, the narrative will lose interpretability and fail to improve comprehension.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GraphXAIN is model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic, allowing integration with any GNN and graph explainer without retraining.
- Mechanism: The method only requires the input graph, target node features, the GNN prediction, and the explainer's output (subgraph + feature importances). It does not depend on model internals or specific explainer algorithms.
- Core assumption: The explanation task can be separated from the prediction model and handled post-hoc with sufficient input information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GraphXAIN is a model- and explainer-agnostic method..."
  - [section] "Importantly, our framework is agnostic to the graph data type, graph model, performed task (classification and regression), and graph explainer..."
- Break condition: If the explainer does not provide feature importance or subgraph outputs, the LLM prompt cannot be constructed, and the method fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: User trust and usability improve when narrative explanations are combined with technical explanations.
- Mechanism: The survey results show that while GraphXAIN alone improves several dimensions (understandability, satisfaction, convincingness, communicability), the combination of technical subgraph + feature importances with GraphXAIN improves all eight measured dimensions significantly.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from both the detail of technical outputs and the accessibility of narrative context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "When combined with another graph explainer method, GraphXAIN further improves trustworthiness, insightfulness, confidence, and usability."
  - [section] "Table 2 presents the survey results along with the statistical significance from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests..."
- Break condition: If the technical and narrative explanations conflict or if the narrative oversimplifies to the point of misrepresentation, trust may not improve.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their explainability challenges
  - Why needed here: Understanding why GNNs are hard to interpret is central to why GraphXAIN is necessary. The paper builds on this gap.
  - Quick check question: Why are standard GNN explanations like subgraphs and feature importance insufficient for non-experts?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) as explanation generators
  - Why needed here: GraphXAIN relies on LLMs to generate narratives; understanding LLM capabilities and limitations is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What risks arise from using LLMs to generate explanations for model predictions?

- Concept: User study design and Likert scale interpretation
  - Why needed here: The paper's evaluation depends on interpreting user feedback across multiple dimensions.
  - Quick check question: How does a 5-point Likert scale help quantify subjective dimensions like "trustworthiness" or "convincingness"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GNN model -> Graph explainer -> Data preprocessor -> LLM prompt constructor -> LLM inference engine -> Output formatter
- Critical path:
  1. Train/Load GNN model
  2. Run graph explainer to get subgraph + feature importances
  3. Construct LLM prompt with node features, subgraph, and prediction
  4. Send prompt to LLM
  5. Receive and present narrative explanation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt length vs. narrative coherence: longer prompts may provide more context but risk exceeding LLM limits or diluting focus.
  - Number of features/nodes included: more detail improves accuracy but can reduce narrative clarity.
  - Use of LLMs vs. rule-based generation: LLMs provide flexibility but introduce variability and potential hallucinations.
- Failure signatures:
  - LLM generates factually incorrect or irrelevant narratives.
  - Subgraph is too sparse or disconnected, leading to poor narrative quality.
  - User study shows no improvement over baseline, indicating the narrative does not aid comprehension.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate GraphXAIN explanations for a small set of nodes in the NBA dataset and manually verify coherence.
  2. Run a user study comparing GraphXAIN alone vs. GNNExplainer alone vs. combined on a subset of examples.
  3. Test the method with a different graph explainer (e.g., CF-GNNExplainer) to verify agnosticism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would GraphXAIN perform on larger, more complex graph datasets with thousands of nodes and edges, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and explanation quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates GraphXAIN on relatively small datasets (NBA with 400 nodes, IMDB with 1,000 nodes). The scalability of the method to larger graphs is not explored.
- Why unresolved: The authors only tested GraphXAIN on small to medium-sized graphs, leaving uncertainty about its performance on larger-scale graphs common in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing GraphXAIN on larger graph datasets (e.g., social networks with millions of nodes) measuring both computational time and explanation quality metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is GraphXAIN to the choice of LLM model and prompt engineering, and what is the optimal configuration for generating high-quality narrative explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses GPT-4o with a specific prompt schema but acknowledges that LLMs may generate hallucinations when interpreting unstructured graph data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct systematic experiments to evaluate how different LLM models or prompt variations affect the quality of generated narratives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using different LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) and prompt variations, with human evaluations of the resulting narrative quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do GraphXAIN's narrative explanations compare to purely numerical or visual explanations in terms of actual user comprehension and decision-making performance in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The user study shows that GraphXAIN improves subjective measures like understandability and satisfaction, but does not test whether these improvements translate to better decision-making.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on user perceptions rather than objective measures of how explanations impact users' ability to make correct decisions based on the model's predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study where users must make decisions based on GNN predictions with different explanation types, measuring decision accuracy and time.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness depends entirely on the quality of the explainer's subgraph and feature importance outputs
- User study sample size is relatively small (n=20) and lacks diversity in domain expertise
- Performance on larger, more complex graphs remains untested
- Risk of LLM hallucinations generating plausible but incorrect explanations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mechanism of translating technical graph outputs into narrative form is technically sound and well-demonstrated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic claims are valid in principle but may face practical integration challenges with different explainer types.
- **Medium Confidence**: The user study results are promising but limited by sample size and scope; replication with larger, more diverse participants is needed.

## Next Checks
1. **Hallucination Audit**: Systematically test GraphXAIN outputs for factual accuracy by comparing generated narratives against ground truth feature relationships in synthetic graph datasets.
2. **Scalability Test**: Apply GraphXAIN to graphs with 10x more nodes and edges to evaluate performance degradation, narrative coherence, and computational overhead.
3. **Cross-Explainer Validation**: Replace GNNExplainer with a different explainer (e.g., PGExplainer or GraphLIME) and assess whether GraphXAIN maintains consistent narrative quality and interpretability gains.
