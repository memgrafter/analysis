# LETS-C: Leveraging Text Embedding for Time Series Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06533
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 76.17% accuracy and 40% AvgWins on 10 benchmark datasets while using only 14.5% of trainable parameters

## Executive Summary
LETS-C introduces a novel approach to time series classification by leveraging text embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing model complexity. The method transforms each dimension of time series data into digit-spaced text strings, generates embeddings using a text embedding model, and fuses these with the original series via element-wise addition. A lightweight CNN-MLP classification head then predicts class labels, demonstrating that high-quality embeddings can reduce the need for complex architectures. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets show LETS-C outperforms 27 baselines including OneFitsAll, using only 14.5% of trainable parameters while achieving 76.17% accuracy.

## Method Summary
LETS-C transforms multivariate time series classification by converting each dimension into text using digit-spaced tokenization (e.g., "6 1 7 , 6 7 3 , 6 9 8 , ... , 8 7 6 , 8 9 0"). These text strings are passed through a text embedding model (specifically text-embedding-3-large) to generate high-dimensional embeddings for each dimension. The embeddings are then fused with the normalized time series using element-wise addition, creating a multimodal representation that combines the semantic richness of embeddings with the raw temporal information. This fused representation is fed into a simple CNN-MLP classification head consisting of 1-3 convolutional layers followed by 1-2 linear layers, which outputs class probabilities. The entire approach is trained end-to-end using the RAdam optimizer, demonstrating that lightweight architectures can achieve state-of-the-art performance when paired with high-quality pre-trained embeddings.

## Key Results
- Achieves 76.17% classification accuracy across 10 benchmark datasets
- Outperforms 27 baselines including OneFitsAll with 40% AvgWins
- Uses only 14.5% of trainable parameters compared to traditional approaches
- Embeddings of time series from the same class show higher similarity than those from different classes, validating the approach's effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Text embeddings preserve class structure better than raw time series for classification.
- Mechanism: Text embedding models encode time series digits into high-dimensional semantic space where intra-class embeddings are more similar than inter-class embeddings, improving discriminability.
- Core assumption: Digit-spacing tokenization preserves numerical semantics without corrupting patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Analysis reveals embeddings of time series from the same class are more similar than those from different classes"
  - [section]: "We computed the average cosine similarity for time series pairs within the same class and across different classes...intra-class similarity consistently exceeds inter-class similarity"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct support found in corpus signals; embeddings discussed but not in classification context.
- Break condition: If tokenization disrupts digit integrity, embedding similarity patterns collapse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fusing embeddings with raw time series via element-wise addition captures complementary information.
- Mechanism: Embeddings encode global temporal patterns while raw series retains local details; addition merges both without parameter overhead.
- Core assumption: Addition is a sufficiently expressive fusion method for multimodal signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "fusing them with the original series using element-wise addition"
  - [section]: "we fuse the embedding with the preprocessed time series using element-wise addition...this approach is well-established...particularly in ResNet"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus mentions embeddings but no fusion comparison evidence.
- Break condition: If fusion requires more complex interactions than addition provides.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lightweight CNN-MLP head suffices because embeddings already encode discriminative features.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained embeddings act as strong feature extractors, reducing need for deep architectures.
- Core assumption: High-quality embeddings reduce downstream model complexity requirements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "uses only 14.5% of the trainable parameters...with a simple classification head composed of CNNs and MLP"
  - [section]: "we pair the fused time series representation with a simple classification head...The choice of a simple classification head is intentional"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus lacks direct comparison of embedding quality vs. model depth.
- Break condition: If downstream task complexity exceeds embedding capacity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tokenization strategies for numerical sequences
  - Why needed here: Numerical tokenization affects embedding quality; poor tokenization corrupts digit semantics
  - Quick check question: Does spacing each digit separately preserve the numerical pattern better than standard BPE?

- Concept: Multimodal fusion techniques
  - Why needed here: Choosing the right fusion method impacts model performance and parameter efficiency
  - Quick check question: Why might element-wise addition outperform concatenation or cross-attention for this use case?

- Concept: Cosine similarity for embedding space analysis
  - Why needed here: Validating embedding quality requires measuring intra-class vs. inter-class similarity
  - Quick check question: What does it mean if intra-class cosine similarity is consistently higher than inter-class?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text preprocessing → Digit-spaced tokenization → Text embedding model → Element-wise addition with raw series → CNN-MLP classification head → Output probabilities
- Critical path: Tokenization quality → Embedding generation → Fusion method → Classification head architecture
- Design tradeoffs: Simpler fusion (addition) vs. richer fusion (cross-attention); fewer parameters vs. potential accuracy loss
- Failure signatures: Low accuracy despite high embedding quality → check tokenization; poor similarity scores → check embedding model; overfitting with complex head → simplify architecture
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test classification accuracy using only raw time series (no embeddings) to establish baseline
  2. Test classification using only embeddings (no raw series) to measure embedding contribution
  3. Compare addition vs. concatenation vs. fusion network for multimodal integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different tokenization strategies for numerical time series data affect the quality of text embeddings and subsequent classification performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that tokenization of numerical strings significantly affects embeddings, and explores digit-space tokenization, but does not systematically compare multiple tokenization strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses one tokenization method (digit-space tokenization) and does not evaluate other potential strategies like preserving decimal points or using different digit groupings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of classification accuracy across multiple tokenization strategies (e.g., preserving decimals, different digit groupings, using special tokens for time steps) on the same benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of truncation length on classification performance when using text-embedding-3-large, and how does this trade-off vary across datasets with different time series lengths?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that text-embedding-3-large supports a maximum token length of 8191 and discusses truncation, but does not provide detailed analysis of truncation length effects on performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions truncation and maximum token length without exploring how different truncation lengths affect accuracy across datasets with varying time series lengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical analysis showing classification accuracy and AvgWins across different truncation lengths (e.g., 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024) for each dataset, identifying optimal truncation points.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of LETS-C compare on newly constructed or strictly held-out datasets that were not used in training the text embedding models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges it did not evaluate on a newly constructed or strictly held-out dataset to check for potential data leakage into the OpenAI embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation only uses publicly available datasets from the UEA Archive, which may have been partially seen during the training of the text embedding models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing LETS-C on a completely new time series dataset that was not available during the training of the text embedding models, comparing accuracy to baselines on both old and new datasets.

## Limitations
- The specific CNN-MLP architecture details are underspecified beyond "1-3 convolutional and 1-2 linear layers"
- Evaluation covers only 10 datasets, limiting generalizability assessment across diverse time series characteristics
- No systematic comparison of alternative tokenization strategies to validate digit-spaced tokenization superiority

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (Evidence strongly supports):
- Text embeddings can improve time series classification accuracy
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets
- The lightweight architecture significantly reduces parameter count while maintaining performance

**Medium Confidence** (Evidence supports but with caveats):
- Digit-spaced tokenization is optimal for this approach
- Element-wise addition is the best fusion method for multimodal integration
- Embeddings capture discriminative features sufficient for simple classification heads

**Low Confidence** (Evidence weak or missing):
- The method generalizes to all time series domains without adaptation
- Text embedding models are universally superior to specialized time series encoders
- The specific architectural choices are optimal beyond what's presented

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Systematically remove the text embedding component and compare classification performance to quantify the exact contribution of the embedding fusion versus the CNN-MLP architecture alone.

2. **Tokenization Comparison**: Test alternative tokenization strategies (standard BPE, whole-number tokens, sliding window approaches) to empirically validate that digit-spaced tokenization provides superior embedding quality for time series data.

3. **Fusion Method Analysis**: Compare element-wise addition against concatenation, cross-attention, and gating mechanisms to determine if the simple fusion approach is truly optimal or merely sufficient for the current architecture.
