# Using Prompts to Guide Large Language Models in Imitating a Real Person's Language Style

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Tree-of-thoughts prompting significantly improves LLM language style imitation performance

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of prompts to guide large language models in imitating real person's language styles without extensive training. Three LLMs (GPT-4, Llama 3, and Gemini 1.5) were compared under identical zero-shot prompts, with Llama 3 further tested using three prompting methods (zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and tree-of-thoughts). The research introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework combining human evaluation, LLM evaluation, and automated classification to assess imitation quality.

The key finding demonstrates that tree-of-thoughts prompting significantly outperforms other approaches, with Llama 3 achieving the highest imitation performance when using this method. The study successfully creates a conversational AI that interacts with users in the language style of a real person without requiring model retraining, suggesting that prompt engineering alone can be sufficient for creating personalized conversational agents.

## Method Summary
The study uses three public interview datasets from celebrities (Elon Musk, Tom Holland), pre-processed with anonymized names and split into training/test sets. Three LLMs are compared using zero-shot prompts containing task instruction, context description, example dialogue, and output format. For the primary LLM (Llama 3), three prompting methods are evaluated: zero-shot, chain-of-thought (adding planning element), and tree-of-thoughts (generating multiple candidate plans and conversations with model-based evaluation). A sliding window technique (4400 words window, 2200 word stride) handles long training texts. Three evaluation methods are used: human evaluation (scoring 1-20), LLM evaluation (Claude 3.5 scoring 1-10), and automated evaluation using a BERT-based binary classifier predicting target role.

## Key Results
- Llama 3 achieved the highest imitation performance with zero-shot prompts: 13.30 (human), 7.10 (LLM), and 51% accuracy (automated)
- Tree-of-thoughts prompting significantly outperformed other approaches for Llama 3: 12.80 (human), 6.10 (LLM), and 30% accuracy (automated)
- Tree-of-thoughts framework successfully created a conversational AI that interacts with users in a real person's language style without model retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-shot prompts guide LLMs to imitate language styles by providing explicit task instructions and reference text.
- Mechanism: The prompt contains four elements: task instruction, context description, example dialogue, and output format. These elements prime the LLM to generate text matching the target's linguistic patterns without model retraining.
- Core assumption: LLMs can perform style imitation using only natural language prompts and a small amount of reference text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "well-designed prompts can significantly improve the performance of LLMs on these tasks"
  - [section]: "A zero-shot prompt was designed, which guides these LLMs in imitating the language style of specified individuals based on their texts"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific prompt structure
- Break condition: If the reference text is insufficient or the prompt elements are poorly specified, the model cannot capture the target style effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting improves language style imitation by enabling multi-step reasoning and self-evaluation.
- Mechanism: ToT generates multiple candidate plans and conversations, then uses model-based evaluation to select the best outputs that match the target style. This iterative refinement process outperforms linear prompting approaches.
- Core assumption: The model can accurately evaluate its own outputs for style similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting method to Llama 3, a conversational AI with the language style of a real person was created"
  - [section]: "Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) is a framework that guides a language model in exploring multiple reasoning paths during problem-solving"
  - [corpus]: Moderate - related papers show ToT effectiveness for reasoning tasks
- Break condition: If the model's self-evaluation capability is insufficient, the ToT framework may select suboptimal outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sliding window technique with text segmentation enables effective training on long documents within token limits.
- Mechanism: The training text is divided into overlapping segments (4400 words with 2200 word stride), allowing the model to process the entire dataset across multiple API calls while maintaining contextual continuity.
- Core assumption: Overlapping segments preserve sufficient context for style learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "I employed the sliding window technique to divide the training set into multiple text segments. The window size was set to 4400 words, with a stride of 2200 words"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific implementation
- Break condition: If the stride is too large, style patterns may be lost between segments.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The study relies entirely on prompt design rather than model training, making prompt structure critical
  - Quick check question: What are the four essential elements of the zero-shot prompt used in Task 1?

- Concept: Tree-of-Thoughts framework mechanics
  - Why needed here: ToT is the key method that significantly improves imitation performance
  - Quick check question: How does the ToT framework select the best conversation output?

- Concept: BERT-based classification for style evaluation
  - Why needed here: Automated evaluation requires a binary classifier to determine if generated text matches the target style
  - Quick check question: What accuracy did the BERT classifier achieve on the validation set for Tony's style?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> LLM API integration -> Prompt management -> Evaluation pipeline -> ToT framework implementation
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Prompt execution → Output generation → Evaluation → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting: Zero-shot reduces data requirements but may be less precise
  - ToT complexity vs. performance: ToT improves results but requires more API calls and processing
  - Human vs. automated evaluation: Human evaluation is more accurate but resource-intensive
- Failure signatures:
  - Low human evaluation scores across all models: Indicates fundamental prompt design issues
  - BERT classifier accuracy below 90%: Suggests insufficient training data or poor feature extraction
  - ToT voting produces inconsistent results: May indicate flawed evaluation criteria
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test zero-shot prompt with GPT-4 on Dataset 1, evaluate human scores
  2. Implement CoT prompt with Llama 3 on Dataset 3, compare to zero-shot results
  3. Run ToT framework with sliding window on full Dataset 3, measure automated evaluation success rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different prompting methods compare when applied to LLMs for language style imitation across diverse domains (e.g., literature, politics, entertainment)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study compares zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and tree-of-thoughts prompting methods using datasets from interviews with celebrities, but suggests future research should evaluate more models and prompts across various domains.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on a limited set of datasets and only three prompting methods, leaving uncertainty about performance in other contexts or with more complex prompts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using diverse datasets (e.g., literature, news articles, social media) and a broader range of prompting techniques, evaluated using consistent metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the underlying mechanisms that make tree-of-thoughts prompting more effective for language style imitation compared to other methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found that tree-of-thoughts prompting significantly outperformed other methods for Llama 3, but did not investigate why this method is more effective.
- Why unresolved: The study demonstrated superior performance but did not explore the cognitive or computational reasons behind this advantage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the reasoning processes and decision-making pathways used by different prompting methods, potentially through model interpretability techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How scalable and generalizable is the approach of using prompts for language style imitation without extensive training across different LLM architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study successfully used prompts to create a conversational AI with Llama 3, but only tested three LLM models and did not assess scalability or generalizability.
- Why unresolved: The study's limited scope prevents conclusions about how well this approach works with other models or in different applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of the prompting approach across a wide range of LLM architectures, tasks, and real-world applications, measuring consistency and effectiveness.

## Limitations
- The study relies on interview transcripts from only three public figures, limiting the diversity of language styles tested
- The automated evaluation using a BERT-based classifier achieved only 51% accuracy, indicating potential issues with the evaluation methodology
- The prompts used are not fully specified in the paper, making exact replication challenging

## Confidence
- Tree-of-thoughts effectiveness: High
- Zero-shot prompt performance: Medium
- BERT classifier reliability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the zero-shot prompt with additional public figures across different domains (authors, politicians, athletes) to assess generalizability
2. Implement cross-validation of the BERT classifier by testing it on held-out validation data from the same celebrities to verify its accuracy
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual prompt elements (context description, example dialogue, output format) to quantify their individual contributions to imitation performance
