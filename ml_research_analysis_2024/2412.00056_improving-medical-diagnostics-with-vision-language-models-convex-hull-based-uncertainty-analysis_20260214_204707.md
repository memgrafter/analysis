# Improving Medical Diagnostics with Vision-Language Models: Convex Hull-Based Uncertainty Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00056
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Convex hull-based method quantifies VLM uncertainty in medical imaging, showing 3115-fold increase in mean uncertainty from temperature 0.001 to 1.00

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel convex hull-based approach to quantify uncertainty in vision-language models (VLMs) for medical image analysis. The method analyzes the spatial spread of VLM-generated radiology reports by computing convex hull areas of response embeddings clustered using DBSCAN. Applied to chest X-ray images with the LLM-CXR model at varying temperature settings, the study demonstrates that uncertainty increases significantly with temperature, highlighting the importance of uncertainty quantification for reliable VLM deployment in healthcare applications.

## Method Summary
The method generates multiple radiology reports per chest X-ray image at different temperature settings using the LLM-CXR model, then embeds these reports using a pre-trained BERT model. The high-dimensional embeddings are reduced to 2D using PCA, clustered with DBSCAN, and convex hull areas are computed for each cluster. The total uncertainty is calculated as the sum of convex hull areas across all clusters. The study uses 30 responses per image at temperatures 0.001, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00, then analyzes the relationship between temperature and uncertainty through statistical measures.

## Key Results
- Mean uncertainty increased 3115-fold from temperature 0.001 to 1.00
- Uncertainty rises monotonically with temperature across all tested ranges
- Convex hull methodology effectively captures response diversity in embedding space
- Statistical analysis shows significant differences in uncertainty metrics across temperature settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The convex hull area grows with response diversity because spatial spread in embedding space reflects semantic variation.
- Mechanism: As temperature increases, model outputs become more varied, causing embeddings to spread further apart in the vector space. The convex hull, being the minimal convex boundary enclosing all points, naturally increases in area as the points become more dispersed.
- Core assumption: Euclidean distance in embedding space correlates with semantic dissimilarity of generated responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method quantifies uncertainty by analyzing the spatial spread of VLM-generated radiology reports using convex hull areas"
  - [section] "As the diversity of the responses increases, the distances between embedding points in E(R(p)) will also increase. The convex hull is the minimum convex set containing all these points, and its area is proportional to the spatial distribution of the points."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for convex hull methodology in VLM uncertainty quantification

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DBSCAN clustering isolates distinct response groups before hull computation, preventing noise from inflating uncertainty metrics.
- Mechanism: DBSCAN identifies dense regions of similar embeddings (clusters) and excludes sparse/noisy points (noise). By computing convex hulls only on valid clusters, the method focuses on meaningful response patterns rather than outliers.
- Core assumption: DBSCAN's parameters (ε=0.25, min_samples=3) appropriately distinguish between genuine response variation and noise in the embedding space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "DBSCAN algorithm is utilized to cluster the 2-D embeddings in order to detect distinct groups within the response space"
  - [section] "For each cluster c ∈ L without noise points ( c = −1), the convex hull is calculated along with the corresponding area"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence about DBSCAN parameter selection for VLM response clustering

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temperature scaling directly controls the stochasticity of VLM outputs, creating a measurable relationship between temperature and uncertainty.
- Mechanism: Higher temperature values (T > 1) flatten the probability distribution over vocabulary tokens, increasing sampling randomness. This stochasticity manifests as greater variation in generated reports, which the convex hull method captures as increased area.
- Core assumption: The temperature parameter in LLM-CXR has a monotonic relationship with output diversity across all medical report generation tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using the LLM-CXR model on chest X-ray images at different temperature settings (0.001-1.00), the study shows that uncertainty increases with temperature"
  - [section] "The temperature parameter t affects the stochasticity of the VLM's outputs. As t increases, the model produces more diverse and uncertain responses"
  - [section] "∂A(p, t)/∂t > 0 This shows that the uncertainty A(p, t) increases with the temperature"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related work on VLMs in medicine but no specific evidence about temperature-uncertainty relationships

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: PCA dimensionality reduction from high-dimensional embeddings to 2D for visualization and clustering
  - Why needed here: High-dimensional embeddings (e.g., BERT embeddings) are computationally expensive to cluster and visualize; 2D projection makes convex hull computation tractable while preserving major variance
  - Quick check question: If the first two principal components capture 95% of variance, does this justify the 2D projection for uncertainty measurement?

- Concept: DBSCAN clustering algorithm and its sensitivity to density parameters
  - Why needed here: DBSCAN identifies natural groupings in response embeddings without requiring pre-specified cluster numbers, which is important when response patterns are unknown
  - Quick check question: How would changing ε from 0.25 to 0.5 affect the number and size of clusters identified in the embedding space?

- Concept: Convex hull computation and its relationship to spatial dispersion metrics
  - Why needed here: The convex hull area provides a geometric measure of response spread that correlates with uncertainty; it's more robust than simple distance metrics because it considers the full shape of the response distribution
  - Quick check question: Would using the convex hull volume (in higher dimensions) provide more accurate uncertainty quantification than the 2D area?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VLM (LLM-CXR) -> Temperature Controller -> Response Generator -> BERT Encoder -> PCA Projector -> DBSCAN Clustering -> Convex Hull Calculator -> Uncertainty Metric
- Critical path: Temperature setting -> Response generation -> Embedding -> Dimensionality reduction -> Clustering -> Hull computation -> Area calculation
- Design tradeoffs: 2D PCA projection sacrifices some information for computational efficiency; DBSCAN parameters must balance sensitivity to noise vs. capturing true variation; convex hull is computationally efficient but may oversimplify complex response distributions
- Failure signatures: Temperature-uncertainty relationship breaks down (flat hull area curve); clustering fails to identify meaningful groups (all points labeled as noise); PCA components capture insufficient variance (low cumulative explained variance)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate temperature-uncertainty relationship by plotting convex hull area vs. temperature across multiple X-ray images
  2. Test DBSCAN sensitivity by varying ε and min_samples parameters and measuring impact on uncertainty metrics
  3. Compare convex hull area to alternative uncertainty measures (standard deviation of embeddings, silhouette score) to validate effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the convex hull-based uncertainty quantification method perform on other medical imaging modalities beyond chest X-rays?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper applies the method to chest X-ray images using the LLM-CXR model, but does not explore its applicability to other medical imaging modalities like CT scans, MRI, or ultrasound.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to a single medical imaging modality and model, preventing generalization of the method's effectiveness across different types of medical images and corresponding models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the convex hull-based method on various medical imaging modalities with different VLM models and comparing the results would demonstrate its broader applicability and effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal temperature setting for balancing response diversity and uncertainty in VLMs for medical applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that uncertainty increases with temperature settings from 0.001 to 1.00, but does not identify an optimal temperature that balances diversity and reliability.
- Why unresolved: The study demonstrates the relationship between temperature and uncertainty but does not explore the trade-off between response diversity and reliability for practical medical use.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate model performance (accuracy, reliability) at different temperature settings while measuring uncertainty would help identify the optimal temperature for medical applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can explainable AI (XAI) methods be integrated with the convex hull-based uncertainty quantification to improve interpretability of VLM responses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions in the discussion that integrating XAI methods could provide explainability and transparency with regard to VLMs' responses, but does not explore specific implementations.
- Why unresolved: While the potential benefit of XAI integration is acknowledged, the paper does not investigate how specific XAI techniques could be combined with the convex hull approach to enhance interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing specific XAI methods (like attention visualization, feature importance) integrated with the convex hull uncertainty quantification would demonstrate how interpretability can be improved.

## Limitations

- The study relies on specific DBSCAN parameters (ε=0.25, min_samples=3) without sensitivity analysis or validation across different VLM architectures
- The convex hull methodology lacks corpus validation and depends on the assumption that embedding space distance correlates with semantic variation
- The approach is limited to chest X-ray images and the LLM-CXR model, restricting generalizability to other medical imaging modalities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The positive correlation between temperature and uncertainty (A(p,t) increases with t) is well-supported by the experimental design and statistical results showing a 3115-fold increase in mean uncertainty from temperature 0.001 to 1.00.
- **Medium Confidence**: The convex hull-based methodology for quantifying uncertainty is theoretically sound, but lacks corpus validation and depends heavily on proper embedding space interpretation.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific DBSCAN parameter choices and their generalizability across different VLM architectures and medical imaging tasks.

## Next Checks

1. Perform sensitivity analysis on DBSCAN parameters (ε and min_samples) to determine their impact on uncertainty metrics and validate that the chosen values (ε=0.25, min_samples=3) are optimal for this application.
2. Compare convex hull area uncertainty quantification against alternative measures (e.g., embedding standard deviation, entropy-based metrics) to validate that the geometric approach captures meaningful uncertainty beyond what simpler metrics would reveal.
3. Test the temperature-uncertainty relationship across multiple VLM architectures and medical imaging modalities to determine if the observed correlation generalizes beyond the LLM-CXR model on chest X-rays.
