# Synthetic Tabular Data Generation for Imbalanced Classification: The Surprising Effectiveness of an Overlap Class

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15657
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15657
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces ORD method that converts binary class labels to ternary by adding an overlap class, improving synthetic data quality and classifier performance on imbalanced datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality synthetic minority examples for imbalanced classification in tabular data. The authors propose a novel technique called ORD that converts binary class labels to ternary by introducing an overlap class for instances where minority and majority distributions overlap. By training conditional generative models on this ternary-labeled data and excluding overlap instances during classifier training, ORD significantly improves both the quality of synthetic minority examples and overall classifier accuracy compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
ORD works by first identifying instances in the majority class that are near the decision boundary with the minority class, labeling these as an "overlap class." A conditional generative model is then trained on the ternary-labeled dataset to generate synthetic examples. During classifier training, only synthetic data from the minority class and clear majority class (excluding overlap instances) is used, which simplifies the decision boundary and improves classification accuracy. The method has been tested with various generative models including TabSyn, CTabSyn, and ForestFlow, demonstrating consistent improvements across multiple real-world datasets.

## Key Results
- ORD improves synthetic minority example quality by explicitly modeling the overlap region between classes
- Excluding overlap instances during classifier training declutters the decision boundary and enhances accuracy
- Extensive experiments show ORD outperforms existing methods across four real datasets, five classifiers, and five generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Converting binary class labels to ternary labels by adding an overlap class improves the quality of synthetic minority examples generated by deep generative models. The ternary labeling scheme provides more granular supervision during training, enabling the generative model to better capture the boundary region between classes. This results in higher quality synthetic data for both majority and minority classes, especially for recent diffusion-based models like TabSyn and ForestFlow.

### Mechanism 2
Training the classifier on synthetic data that excludes the overlap class improves classification accuracy by simplifying the decision boundary. The overlap class contains instances that are ambiguous and difficult to classify. By excluding these instances from training, the classifier learns a cleaner decision boundary between clear majority and minority examples, reducing confusion and improving accuracy on both classes.

### Mechanism 3
The combination of improved synthetic data generation and selective under-sampling of overlap instances leads to better classifier performance than either technique alone. The ternary labeling improves the generative model's output quality, while the exclusion of overlap instances during classifier training simplifies the learning task. Together, these complementary effects produce higher overall accuracy than either modification alone.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Conditional generative modeling**
  - Why needed here: The method requires modifying existing generative models to support class-conditional generation with ternary labels, which is essential for the overlap detection approach.
  - Quick check question: How does conditioning on class labels during generation affect the quality and diversity of synthetic examples compared to unconditional generation?

- **Concept: Imbalanced classification metrics**
  - Why needed here: Evaluating the method requires understanding metrics beyond overall accuracy, such as macro-averaged accuracy, minority/majority class accuracy, F1 scores, and AUC-ROC, which are standard for imbalanced datasets.
  - Quick check question: Why is macro-averaged accuracy preferred over overall accuracy when evaluating classifiers on imbalanced datasets?

- **Concept: Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation**
  - Why needed here: The overlap detection relies on using k-fold cross-validation with random forest classifiers to identify instances where committee members disagree, indicating boundary regions.
  - Quick check question: How does ensemble disagreement serve as a proxy for instance uncertainty in high-dimensional data where traditional distance-based methods fail?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Overlap detection (k-fold RF) -> Ternary-labeled generator training -> Synthetic data sampling -> Classifier training (excluding D01)
- **Critical path:** The most critical sequence is: preprocess data → detect overlap → train ternary-labeled generator → sample synthetic data → train classifier. Each step depends on the previous one, and failure in overlap detection will propagate through the entire pipeline.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Using k=2 for cross-validation balances computational efficiency with adequate overlap detection, but higher k values might improve detection accuracy at the cost of training time. The threshold τ controls the size of the overlap set and must be tuned per dataset and generator.
- **Failure signatures:** Poor overlap detection manifests as either too few D01 points (missing important boundary information) or too many (incorrectly labeling clear instances as ambiguous). In classifier training, failure shows up as decreased accuracy when synthetic data is used compared to real data.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run overlap detection on a small subset of the dataset to verify the D01 set size and quality of identified boundary instances.
  2. Train the conditional generator on ternary-labeled data and evaluate synthetic data quality using an oracle classifier on a 2D toy dataset where true labels are known.
  3. Train the final classifier using only synthetic data (excluding D01) and compare accuracy to baseline methods to establish the effectiveness of the approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does the effectiveness of ORD vary with different imbalance ratios beyond the 1.5-2% tested?
- **Open Question 2:** Can ORD be extended to multi-class classification problems beyond binary classification?
- **Open Question 3:** How does ORD's performance compare when applied to continuous target variables with skewed distributions?

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness depends on accurate overlap detection, which may fail when class boundaries are complex or when feature distributions have significant overlap
- Computational overhead of k-fold cross-validation for overlap detection scales poorly with dataset size
- The assumption that overlap instances are always detrimental to learning may not hold for all imbalanced datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core claim that converting binary labels to ternary labels improves generative model quality has strong experimental support with multiple datasets and classifiers.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that excluding overlap instances improves classifier accuracy is well-supported but relies on the assumption that overlap points are always detrimental to learning.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that the two mechanisms are complementary and produce multiplicative effects lacks rigorous ablation studies to separate their individual contributions.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on a controlled synthetic dataset where the true overlap region is known to quantify the individual contributions of ternary labeling versus overlap exclusion.
2. Test the method on a multi-class imbalanced dataset to evaluate whether the ternary labeling scheme generalizes beyond binary classification.
3. Measure the computational overhead of overlap detection across datasets of varying sizes to establish practical scalability limits.
