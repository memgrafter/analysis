# Generative AI in Vision: A Survey on Models, Metrics and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.16369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16369
- Authors: Gaurav Raut; Apoorv Singh
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey comparing diffusion models with GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows for vision tasks

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of generative AI diffusion models in vision, examining their theoretical foundations, applications, and evaluation metrics. The authors compare diffusion models with other generative approaches like GANs and VAEs, highlighting their superior performance in tasks such as text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and inpainting. The paper details key mechanisms including denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and score-based generative modeling, while also addressing current research gaps and future directions in the field.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on generative diffusion models by examining their theoretical foundations, implementation mechanisms, and performance characteristics. It compares different generative model architectures including GANs, VAEs, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, with particular emphasis on how diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation through iterative denoising processes. The paper evaluates these models using standard metrics like FID and IS, and discusses applications across multiple vision domains while identifying key research directions and limitations.

## Key Results
- Diffusion models outperform legacy models in text-to-image synthesis through iterative denoising guided by learned score functions
- Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve computational efficiency by applying diffusion in compressed latent space rather than pixel space
- Evaluation metrics FID and IS provide quantitative measures of generative model quality and diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Diffusion models outperform legacy models in text-to-image synthesis due to their iterative denoising process guided by learned score functions. The forward diffusion process adds Gaussian noise over many time steps, while the reverse process learns to denoise step-by-step, guided by the score function ∇x log q(x). This allows for high-quality image generation with strong control via conditioning (e.g., text prompts).

### Mechanism 2
Latent diffusion models (LDMs) improve efficiency by applying the diffusion process in a compressed latent space rather than pixel space. The input image is first encoded into a lower-dimensional latent representation. The diffusion process is applied in this latent space, reducing the number of denoising steps and computational cost. A decoder then reconstructs the image from the latent.

### Mechanism 3
Evaluation metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) provide quantitative measures of generative model quality and diversity. FID measures the similarity between the feature distributions of generated and real images using a pre-trained network. IS measures both the clarity and diversity of generated images through class prediction entropy analysis.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probability density functions and their estimation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how generative models learn to represent the underlying distribution of training data is fundamental to grasping differences between approaches like GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between explicitly and implicitly learning a probability density function?

- Concept: Variational inference and the evidence lower bound (ELBO)
  - Why needed here: The ELBO is used to train VAEs and forms the basis for some diffusion model training objectives
  - Quick check question: How does the ELBO allow us to optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood when the true likelihood is intractable?

- Concept: Markov chains and stochastic processes
  - Why needed here: Diffusion models are based on Markov chains, where each step depends only on the previous one
  - Quick check question: What property of a Markov chain allows us to define the forward and reverse diffusion processes as sequential steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder -> Forward diffusion (noise injection) -> Reverse diffusion (denoising via learned score function) -> Decoder -> Evaluation metrics (FID/IS)

- Critical path: 1) Encode input (if using LDMs) 2) Apply forward diffusion to generate noisy latents 3) Train network to predict noise at each step (reverse process) 4) Sample by reversing the diffusion process using the trained network 5) Decode latents (if using LDMs) 6) Evaluate using FID/IS

- Design tradeoffs: Pixel space vs. latent space (Higher quality vs. faster training/inference), Number of diffusion steps (Quality vs. computational cost), Noise schedule (Stability vs. efficiency), Conditioning mechanism (Control vs. complexity)

- Failure signatures: Mode collapse (similar outputs), High FID/IS scores (poor quality/diversity), Unstable training (exploding/vanishing gradients), Slow sampling (inefficient reverse process)

- First 3 experiments: 1) Implement a simple diffusion model on a toy dataset (e.g., MNIST) to understand basic mechanics 2) Compare performance of pixel-space diffusion model vs. latent diffusion model on a small image dataset 3) Experiment with different noise schedules and evaluate impact on training stability and sample quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can diffusion models be effectively scaled to handle time-series forecasting applications while maintaining computational efficiency? The paper mentions exploring time-series forecasting applications as a future direction, suggesting this remains an open area of research. While diffusion models have shown promise in image and text-to-image tasks, their application to sequential data like time-series presents unique challenges in modeling temporal dependencies and maintaining real-time performance.

### Open Question 2
What are the most effective ways to incorporate physics-inspired constraints into generative diffusion models to improve speed and quality of content creation? The paper identifies physics-inspired generative models as a future research direction, aiming for unprecedented speed and quality in content creation. While the paper suggests potential benefits, the specific methods for integrating physical laws and constraints into diffusion models remain unexplored, including how to balance physical accuracy with generative capabilities.

### Open Question 3
What are the most effective approaches to address bias and fairness issues in generative diffusion models, particularly for text-to-image generation? The paper highlights ethical considerations as a future research direction, specifically mentioning bias, fairness, and societal impact. Despite growing awareness of bias in AI systems, the specific challenges and solutions for diffusion models in generating diverse and unbiased content remain largely unexplored, particularly in multimodal applications like text-to-image.

## Limitations
- Confidence Level: Medium for comparative performance claims between diffusion models and legacy approaches due to limited quantitative comparisons across different model types and datasets
- Confidence Level: Medium regarding efficiency claims for latent diffusion models as detailed ablation studies on trade-offs between latent space dimensionality and compression quality are not provided
- Confidence Level: Low for claims about evaluation metric reliability as the survey does not extensively address known limitations of FID and IS metrics

## Confidence
- Performance comparison claims: Medium confidence
- Latent diffusion efficiency claims: Medium confidence
- Evaluation metric reliability claims: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement head-to-head comparisons between diffusion models and legacy approaches (GANs, VAEs) on standardized benchmarks using identical evaluation protocols and compute budgets to verify claimed performance advantages

2. Conduct systematic experiments varying latent space dimensionality and compression ratios in LDMs to quantify the relationship between information preservation, computational efficiency, and final image quality across different vision tasks

3. Evaluate the correlation between commonly used metrics (FID, IS) and human perceptual quality judgments across diverse image generation tasks, particularly for generated images that may fall outside the training distribution of the evaluation network
