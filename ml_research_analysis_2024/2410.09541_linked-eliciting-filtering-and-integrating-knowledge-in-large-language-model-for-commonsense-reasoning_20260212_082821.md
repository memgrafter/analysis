# LINKED: Eliciting, Filtering and Integrating Knowledge in Large Language Model for Commonsense Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.09541
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09541
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Key outcome**: LINKED improves LLM commonsense reasoning accuracy by up to 9.0% and EPS by 12.5% over baselines while using fewer tokens than other self-enhancement approaches

## Executive Summary
LINKED addresses the challenge of noisy and invalid knowledge in large language models' commonsense reasoning by introducing a knowledge filtering and integration framework. The method trains a reward model to rank generated knowledge by effectiveness and employs a marginal consistent reasoning module for stable answer selection. Experiments on four commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with the added benefit of reduced token usage compared to other self-enhancement approaches.

## Method Summary
LINKED enhances LLM commonsense reasoning through a two-stage process: knowledge filtering and knowledge integration. First, it trains a reward model to evaluate and rank knowledge generated by LLMs based on effectiveness for the target task. This filtered knowledge is then passed to a marginal consistent reasoning module, which ensures stable answer selection by maintaining consistency across reasoning steps. The approach specifically targets the elimination of noisy and invalid knowledge that can degrade reasoning performance, while also improving efficiency through reduced token usage compared to traditional self-enhancement methods.

## Key Results
- Up to 9.0% accuracy improvement on commonsense reasoning benchmarks
- 12.5% effectiveness-preservation score (EPS) gain over state-of-the-art baselines
- Uses fewer tokens than other self-enhancement approaches while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LINKED works by addressing two key problems in LLM commonsense reasoning: knowledge noise and invalid reasoning paths. The reward model acts as a quality filter, identifying which pieces of generated knowledge are actually useful for solving the task rather than introducing noise. The marginal consistent reasoning module then ensures that the filtered knowledge is used coherently across reasoning steps, preventing contradictory or unstable answer selection. This combination of selective knowledge incorporation and consistency maintenance enables more reliable commonsense reasoning without the overhead of processing large volumes of potentially irrelevant information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge filtering in LLMs**: Why needed - Reduces noise and improves reasoning quality; Quick check - Compare reasoning performance with and without filtering
- **Reward model training for knowledge ranking**: Why needed - Provides automated evaluation of knowledge usefulness; Quick check - Validate reward model predictions against human judgments
- **Marginal consistent reasoning**: Why needed - Ensures stable answer selection across reasoning steps; Quick check - Measure consistency scores across multiple reasoning paths
- **Self-enhancement approaches**: Why needed - Context for efficiency claims; Quick check - Compare token usage across different enhancement methods
- **Effectiveness-preservation score (EPS)**: Why needed - Metric for measuring knowledge integration quality; Quick check - Track EPS changes when varying knowledge filtering thresholds

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Knowledge Generation -> Reward Model (filtering) -> Marginal Consistent Reasoning Module -> Answer Selection
**Critical path**: The most important sequence is Knowledge Generation to Reward Model filtering to Marginal Consistent Reasoning, as this directly determines which knowledge is used and how consistently it's applied
**Design tradeoffs**: Prioritizes knowledge quality over quantity, accepting potentially incomplete knowledge if it's more reliable; trades some reasoning depth for stability and efficiency
**Failure signatures**: Over-filtering (missing useful knowledge), under-filtering (insufficient noise reduction), inconsistent reasoning (unstable answers despite filtering), or excessive token usage
**First experiments**:
1. Baseline performance comparison without any filtering
2. Ablation study: reward model filtering only vs. full LINKED pipeline
3. Token efficiency measurement against standard self-enhancement baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to only four commonsense reasoning benchmarks, limiting generalizability claims
- Computational overhead of training and deploying the reward model is not discussed
- Insufficient isolation of individual contributions from knowledge filtering versus marginal consistent reasoning module

## Confidence
- Claims about accuracy improvements and EPS gains: High confidence
- Claims about efficiency through reduced token usage: Medium confidence (lacks full computational overhead analysis)
- Claims about knowledge filtering effectiveness: Medium confidence (limited evaluation scope)
- Claims about stability improvements from the reasoning module: Medium confidence (insufficient isolation of module contributions)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LINKED across a broader range of reasoning tasks beyond the four benchmarks, including non-commonsense domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of the reward model filtering versus the marginal consistent reasoning module
3. Measure end-to-end computational costs, including reward model training and inference overhead, to validate efficiency claims in practical deployment scenarios
