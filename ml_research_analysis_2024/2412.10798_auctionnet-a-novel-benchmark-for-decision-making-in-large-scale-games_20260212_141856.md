# AuctionNet: A Novel Benchmark for Decision-Making in Large-Scale Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.10798
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10798
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AuctionNet is a benchmark for decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived from a real-world online advertising platform

## Executive Summary
AuctionNet is a comprehensive benchmark designed for decision-making in large-scale ad auctions, derived from a real-world online advertising platform. The benchmark consists of three main components: an ad auction environment, a pre-generated dataset, and performance evaluations of baseline bid decision-making algorithms. The environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through the interaction of several modules, including an ad opportunity generation module that employs deep generative networks to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure. To facilitate research and provide insights into the environment, a substantial dataset containing 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding agents, and over 500 million auction records has been pre-generated.

## Method Summary
AuctionNet is implemented as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) with an environment that includes three key modules: an ad opportunity generation module using Latent Diffusion Models, an auction module supporting various mechanisms including GSP, and a bidding module with diverse auto-bidding agents. The benchmark provides a pre-generated dataset of 10 million ad opportunities and over 500 million auction records, along with implementations of several baseline algorithms including PID Controller, Online LP, IQL, Behavior Cloning, and Decision Transformer. The environment has been used to power the NeurIPS 2024 Auto-Bidding in Large-Scale Auctions competition, providing competition environments for over 1,500 teams.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The ad opportunity generation module creates synthetic data that closely mirrors real-world online advertising data.
- **Mechanism:** Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) are used to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating sensitive data exposure risks.
- **Core assumption:** The LDM can capture the distribution of real-world ad opportunities when trained on a sufficiently large and representative dataset.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through the interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative networks to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure.
  - [section 3.1] We have done several related experiments and the empirical results will also be discussed in Section 4.1.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus.
- **Break condition:** If the generated data significantly deviates from the real-world data distribution, the benchmark's utility for training and evaluation will be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The pre-generated dataset provides a substantial and diverse set of ad opportunities for training and evaluation.
- **Mechanism:** The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding agents, and over 500 million auction records.
- **Core assumption:** A large and diverse dataset will enable researchers to train and evaluate their algorithms effectively.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] To facilitate research and provide insights into the environment, we have also pre-generated a substantial dataset based on the environment. The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding agents, and over 500 million auction records.
  - [section 4.2] The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, including 21 advertising episodes. Each episode contains more than 500,000 ad opportunities, divided into 48 steps.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset is not sufficiently diverse or representative, the algorithms trained on it may not generalize well to real-world scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The auction module supports various auction mechanisms, including the popular Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction.
- **Mechanism:** The auction module internally supports several popular auction rules, including GSP, for the convenience of researchers. Additionally, researchers can design specific auction rules tailored to their purposes using the interface of the auction module.
- **Core assumption:** The ability to customize auction mechanisms will enable researchers to study different auction settings and their impact on bidding strategies.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The auction module is anchored in the classic and popular Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction but also allows customization of auction mechanisms as needed.
  - [section 3.3] The auction module internally supports several popular auction rules, including GSP, for the convenience of researchers. Additionally, researchers can design specific auction rules tailored to their purposes using the interface of the auction module.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus.
- **Break condition:** If the auction module's implementation is not accurate or flexible enough, it may not support the desired auction mechanisms or lead to incorrect results.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses POSG to formulate the auto-bidding problem in ad auctions.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key components of a POSG formulation, and how do they apply to the auto-bidding problem?

- **Concept:** Deep Generative Networks
  - **Why needed here:** The paper employs deep generative networks to generate synthetic ad opportunities that resemble real-world data.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the main types of deep generative networks, and how do they differ in their approach to generating data?

- **Concept:** Reinforcement Learning
  - **Why needed here:** The paper evaluates several baseline algorithms, including reinforcement learning approaches, for bid decision-making in ad auctions.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key components of a reinforcement learning algorithm, and how do they apply to the auto-bidding problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Ad Opportunity Generation Module -> Auction Module -> Bidding Module -> Pre-generated Dataset

- **Critical path:**
  1. Ad opportunities are generated using the ad opportunity generation module.
  2. Auto-bidding agents bid for the ad opportunities based on their decision-making algorithms.
  3. The auction module determines the winners and assigns costs based on the auction mechanism.
  4. Agents receive rewards and update their budgets based on the auction results.
  5. The process repeats for the next time step.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Synthetic vs. Real Data: Using synthetic data allows for greater control and privacy, but may not fully capture the complexities of real-world data.
  - Single-agent vs. Multi-agent: Modeling the problem as a multi-agent game better reflects the competitive nature of ad auctions but increases the complexity of the solution.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor Performance: If the algorithms trained on the benchmark perform poorly on real-world data, it may indicate issues with the synthetic data generation or the benchmark's design.
  - Overfitting: If the algorithms overfit to the specific dataset, it may suggest a lack of diversity or generalizability in the benchmark.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Evaluate the performance of a simple bidding strategy (e.g., fixed bid rate) on the benchmark.
  2. Compare the performance of different reinforcement learning algorithms on the benchmark.
  3. Analyze the impact of varying the auction mechanism (e.g., GSP vs. other rules) on bidding strategies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of generative models like AIGB compare to other baselines like IQL and BC in the AuctionNet environment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that AIGB will be integrated into baseline algorithms in the future, suggesting that its performance has not yet been evaluated.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents performance evaluations for existing baselines such as PID Controller, Online LP, IQL, BC, and Decision Transformer. AIGB is mentioned as a future addition, so its performance is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing AIGB in the AuctionNet environment and comparing its performance metrics (e.g., mean episode reward) with those of the existing baselines would provide the necessary evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do the generated ad opportunity features capture the nuanced relationships between user identity information and consumption behavior in real-world data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the similarity between generated and real-world data but notes biases in specific details, such as the Taobao VIP level distribution.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that generated data generally resemble real-world data, it acknowledges biases and suggests that the generative model can be improved, indicating that nuanced relationships may not be fully captured.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting detailed statistical analyses comparing the joint distributions of user identity and consumption behavior in generated versus real-world data would reveal the extent of similarity and highlight any discrepancies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the AuctionNet environment handle the dynamic nature of real-world ad auctions, such as changes in user behavior and market conditions over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the environment includes modules for generating ad opportunities and simulating auctions, but does not explicitly discuss how it adapts to dynamic changes.
- Why unresolved: The paper describes the static components of the environment but does not address how it simulates or adapts to evolving conditions that affect ad auctions in reality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing the environment with time-varying parameters or external shocks would demonstrate its ability to handle dynamic changes and assess its realism.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of synthetic data generation quality, with only vague mention of "several related experiments" to be discussed in Section 4.1
- Insufficient detail on the customization capabilities of the auction module and their practical implementation
- Lack of discussion on how well the pre-generated dataset captures the full complexity and diversity of real-world ad auction scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The architectural framework and implementation details of the three-module system
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about dataset size and diversity, given lack of detailed analysis
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the quality of synthetic data generation and its ability to bridge the gap with real-world data

## Next Checks

1. Request the detailed empirical results comparing synthetic vs. real data distributions that were mentioned but not included in the paper
2. Test the auction module's customization interface by implementing and validating at least two non-standard auction mechanisms
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the pre-generated dataset size to determine the minimum dataset size needed for reliable algorithm evaluation
