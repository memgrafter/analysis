- Primary result: MONET achieves competitive performance with total parameter-matched dense LLMs using 262,144 experts per layer

## Executive Summary
MONET introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to improve mechanistic interpretability of large language models by addressing polysemanticity. The key innovation is a product key composition method that enables scaling expert counts to 262,144 per layer while keeping parameter growth proportional to the square root of expert count. Experimental results demonstrate that MONET achieves competitive performance with total parameter-matched dense LLMs across multiple benchmarks while enabling transparent observations of expert routing patterns and individual expert behaviors.

## Method Summary
MONET is a Mixture-of-Experts architecture that incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end MoE pretraining. It uses product key composition to decompose each expert into bottom and top layer components, then dynamically composes experts using product key retrieval across these components. The architecture scales expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. MONET employs horizontal and vertical expert decomposition with auxiliary losses for load balancing and uses Batch Normalization for adaptive routing quantile estimation.

## Key Results
- MONET achieves competitive performance with total parameter-matched dense LLMs across multiple benchmarks
- Expert specialization enables mutual exclusivity of knowledge across domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation
- Product key composition enables efficient scaling with parameter growth proportional to square root of expert count

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Parameter Scaling
Product key composition enables scaling expert count while keeping parameter growth proportional to square root of expert count. Instead of storing individual expert parameters, MONET decomposes each expert into bottom and top layer components, then dynamically composes experts using product key retrieval across these components.

### Mechanism 2: Expert Specialization
Expert specialization leads to monosemanticity where individual experts capture mutually exclusive knowledge domains. By dramatically increasing expert count (262K per layer), each expert handles a narrow semantic domain, avoiding polysemanticity where neurons respond to multiple unrelated concepts.

### Mechanism 3: End-to-End Optimization
End-to-end sparse dictionary learning within MoE pretraining avoids performance degradation from post-hoc reconstruction. MONET integrates sparse dictionary learning directly into MoE pretraining rather than applying it post-hoc as with SAEs, avoiding out-of-distribution issues.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sparse dictionary learning
  - Why needed here: MONET uses sparse dictionary learning to disentangle features and enable monosemantic experts, contrasting with SAEs that apply this post-hoc
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how MONET and SAEs apply sparse dictionary learning?

- Concept: Product key retrieval
  - Why needed here: MONET uses product key retrieval for efficient expert routing, scaling from O(Nd) to O(√N d) complexity
  - Quick check question: How does product key retrieval reduce the computational complexity of expert selection?

- Concept: Polysemanticity vs monosemanticity
  - Why needed here: MONET aims to eliminate polysemanticity (neurons responding to multiple concepts) by creating monosemantic experts specialized in single domains
  - Quick check question: Why is polysemanticity problematic for mechanistic interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Product key embeddings (w1, w2) for routing → Expert decomposition into bottom (U) and top (V) layers → Dense routing extension → Auxiliary losses (uniformity and ambiguity) → Batch normalization for routing quantile estimation → MoE layer output

- Critical path: Token → routing score calculation → expert composition → MoE layer output → next transformer block

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher expert count improves specialization but increases routing complexity
  - Horizontal vs vertical decomposition offers different parameter distribution tradeoffs
  - Dense routing improves efficiency but requires careful implementation
  - Auxiliary losses help specialization but need proper weighting

- Failure signatures:
  - Uniform routing scores across all experts (no specialization)
  - Performance degradation on open-ended tasks (expert decomposition issues)
  - Memory bottlenecks despite square-root scaling (implementation bugs)
  - Poor load balancing across experts (routing problems)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify routing score distribution with different auxiliary loss weights
  2. Compare horizontal vs vertical decomposition on a small task
  3. Test expert composition by isolating individual expert contributions to output

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the monosemanticity of experts in MONET compare to the monosemanticity achieved by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in terms of feature interpretability and downstream task performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that SAEs have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss, while MONET achieves competitive performance with total parameter-matched dense LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the monosemanticity of MONET's experts and SAEs in terms of feature interpretability or downstream task performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison of the interpretability and performance of MONET's experts versus SAE features on a common set of downstream tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of experts per layer in MONET for achieving the best balance between performance and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses 262,144 experts per layer in MONET, but does not explore the effect of varying the number of experts on performance and interpretability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the impact of different numbers of experts on MONET's performance and interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the number of experts per layer in MONET and evaluating the resulting performance and interpretability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the knowledge unlearning capability of MONET compare to other methods, such as fine-tuning or direct weight editing, in terms of precision and generalizability?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates MONET's ability to perform knowledge unlearning across domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare MONET's knowledge unlearning capability to other methods, such as fine-tuning or direct weight editing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of MONET's knowledge unlearning capability to other methods in terms of precision and generalizability on a common set of knowledge unlearning tasks.

## Limitations
- Limited quantitative validation of monosemanticity claims through rigorous feature analysis
- Lack of comprehensive ablation studies isolating expert decomposition impact
- Evaluation framework doesn't account for routing computational overhead

## Confidence
- High confidence: Claims about parameter efficiency scaling (square-root relationship between expert count and parameters)
- Medium confidence: Claims about expert specialization and mutual exclusivity supported by routing analysis
- Low confidence: Claims about transparent observations of individual expert behaviors and precise knowledge manipulation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct quantitative monosemanticity analysis measuring semantic overlap between experts using CKA or mutual information estimation
2. Perform controlled decomposition ablation comparing horizontal vs vertical decomposition across multiple task types
3. Measure actual inference latency and memory usage under realistic conditions comparing against dense baselines while accounting for routing overhead
