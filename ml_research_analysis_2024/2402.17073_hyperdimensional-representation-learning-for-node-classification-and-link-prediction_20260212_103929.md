# Hyperdimensional Representation Learning for Node Classification and Link Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17073
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: HDGL achieves competitive accuracy to GNNs while requiring only a single data pass and significantly reducing computational cost

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Hyperdimensional Graph Learner (HDGL), a novel method for node classification and link prediction in graphs that maps node features into a very high-dimensional space using injectivity properties of Graph Neural Networks and employs HD operators like bundling and binding to aggregate local neighborhood information. Unlike traditional GNNs that require computationally expensive iterative optimization and hyperparameter tuning, HDGL achieves competitive accuracy on node classification tasks while significantly reducing computational cost and provides reasonable performance on link prediction comparable to DeepWalk and related methods. The method is particularly well-suited for class-incremental learning settings since it requires only a single pass through the data without retraining. Experiments on benchmark datasets (CORA, CiteSeer, PubMed, BlogCatalog, Coauthor CS, Coauthor Physics, DBLP) demonstrate that HDGL achieves accuracy within 1-2% of state-of-the-art GNNs while running substantially faster.

## Method Summary
HDGL maps node features to high-dimensional binary space using random hyperplane tessellation, then aggregates neighborhood information through bundling and binding operations with rotation to create node representations. For node classification, label hyper-vectors are created by bundling node representations of each class, and predictions are made by finding the nearest neighbor. For link prediction, positive and negative edge hyper-vectors are created by binding connected and non-connected node pairs respectively, and new links are predicted by comparing distances in this hyperdimensional space. The method requires only a single pass through the data without iterative optimization or hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Results
- HDGL achieves node classification accuracy within 1-2% of state-of-the-art GNNs on benchmark datasets
- Runtime is substantially faster than traditional GNNs due to single-pass computation
- Link prediction performance matches DeepWalk and related methods on average
- Method well-suited for class-incremental learning without retraining requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HDGL achieves competitive accuracy to GNNs by using hyperdimensional computing to preserve node features and topology information.
- Mechanism: Node features are mapped into high-dimensional binary space using random hyperplane tessellation. Binding operations couple each node with its neighborhood information while rotation prevents representational collapse.
- Core assumption: Nodes with similar multi-sets of features over their k-hop neighborhoods are likely to have similar local topologies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] HDGL maps node features into a very high-dimensional space using the injectivity property of node representations in GNNs
  - [section] We assume that nodes that have identical multi-sets of features over their k-hop neighborhoods are likely to also have identical local topologies
  - [corpus] Weak - only 1/8 corpus papers mention injectivity or representational power
- Break condition: If the assumption fails (similar features but different topologies), the binding operation may incorrectly merge dissimilar nodes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: HDGL requires only a single pass through data, making it computationally efficient and well-suited for class-incremental learning.
- Mechanism: HD representations are computed once and stored. Label hyper-vectors are created by bundling node representations of each class. No iterative optimization or hyperparameter tuning is needed.
- Core assumption: Once node representations are computed, they remain valid for all future class-incremental updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] HDGL requires only a single pass through the data set
  - [section] HDGL eliminates the need for retraining, resulting in substantial savings in both runtime and computation costs
  - [section] We also show that HDGL is well-suited for data/class-incremental learning
- Break condition: If node representations become outdated due to graph evolution, the single-pass approach may degrade performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: HDGL performs competitively on link prediction by encoding edge information using binding operations between node representations.
- Mechanism: Positive and negative edge hyper-vectors are created by binding node pairs that are connected and not connected respectively. New link predictions are made by comparing distances in this hyperdimensional space.
- Core assumption: The semantic relationships governing existing edges also apply to new potential edges.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] HDGL matches the performance of DeepWalk and related methods on link prediction
  - [section] we leverage on the assumption that the underlying semantics governing existing links...will also apply to new edges
  - [corpus] Weak - only 1/8 corpus papers mention link prediction performance
- Break condition: If edge semantics change over time or differ between existing and potential edges, this assumption may fail.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Feature mapper -> Neighborhood aggregator -> Classifier/Link predictor
- Critical path:
  - Map features → Aggregate neighborhoods → Create label hyper-vectors → Classify nodes
  - For link prediction: Create node representations → Create edge hyper-vectors → Compute distances → Predict links
- Design tradeoffs:
  - HD dimensionality vs. computational cost: Higher dimensions improve representational power but increase computation
  - Neighbor sampling size vs. accuracy: More neighbors improve representation but increase computation
  - Rotation usage vs. injectivity: Rotation prevents representational collapse but adds complexity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor classification accuracy: May indicate insufficient HD dimensionality or incorrect neighborhood aggregation
  - High variance in results: May indicate insufficient sampling of neighbors or unstable random projections
  - Slow runtime: May indicate too high HD dimensionality or inefficient implementation of HD operations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify feature mapping by checking that similar features produce similar HD vectors
  2. Test neighborhood aggregation with synthetic graph where topology is known
  3. Compare classification accuracy with varying HD dimensions on a small dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- The injectivity assumption (similar features imply similar topology) may not hold in real-world graphs where different topologies can produce similar feature patterns
- Link prediction evaluation is relatively sparse with only comparison to DeepWalk and no evaluation against more recent GNN-based methods
- Performance scaling with graph size and density is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence

- **Node Classification Performance Claims**: Medium confidence - While the paper shows HDGL achieves within 1-2% of GNNs, the assumption of topological injectivity is not thoroughly validated
- **Computational Efficiency Claims**: High confidence - The single-pass nature and elimination of iterative optimization is clearly demonstrated
- **Link Prediction Claims**: Low confidence - Limited experimental validation and sparse comparison to modern methods

## Next Checks

1. **Topological Injectivity Test**: Create synthetic graphs where nodes have identical feature distributions but different local topologies, then verify HDGL produces different representations
2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Systematically evaluate performance across different HD dimensions and neighborhood sizes to understand the tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost
3. **Link Prediction Benchmark**: Compare HDGL against recent GNN-based link prediction methods (e.g., SEAL, CompGCN) on the same datasets to validate the claimed performance parity with DeepWalk
