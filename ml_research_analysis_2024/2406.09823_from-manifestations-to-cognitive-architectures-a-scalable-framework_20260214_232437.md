# From Manifestations to Cognitive Architectures: a Scalable Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09823
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09823
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Novel computational framework that builds cognitive architectures from simple primitives by interpreting reality as persistent latent information manifesting through SDRs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel computational framework for cognitive architectures that departs from traditional optimization-based AI methods. The framework models the world as an information source where latent information persists and manifests differently under varying conditions. Starting from a simple primitive called the Footprint that processes Spatial Distributed Representations (SDRs), the framework builds abstractions hierarchically into Cells, Clusters, and Metaclusters, ultimately forming a Synthetic Cognition capable of representing elements of classical cognitive architectures like Long Term Memory and Working Memory.

The key innovation is the framework's ability to construct complex cognitive structures from a basic primitive in a seamless, scalable manner. The Self-Projecting Persistence Principle (SPPP) serves as the theoretical foundation, stating that latent information persists in time and continually reveals itself through manifestations. The framework demonstrates how this approach can address Fodor and Pylyshyn's Systematicity Challenge, though specific quantitative metrics are not provided. Success is evidenced by the framework's ability to build a complete Synthetic Cognition from basic primitives.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs cognitive architectures through a hierarchical approach starting with a basic primitive called the Footprint, which processes Spatial Distributed Representations (SDRs) to create abstractions from concrete manifestations. These Footprints are organized into Cells that group similar representations with shared thresholds, which then form Clusters as hierarchies of Cells. Multiple Clusters are connected into Metaclusters to handle different manifestation types and build associations, ultimately forming Synthetic Cognition. The framework relies on the Self-Projecting Persistence Principle, which states that latent information persists in time and continually reveals itself through manifestations. The construction follows a critical path from Footprint to Cell to Cluster to Metacluster to complete Synthetic Cognition, with each level building more abstract representations from the level below.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully builds elements of classical cognitive architectures (LTM, WM) from simple SDR-processing primitives
- Hierarchical construction approach demonstrates seamless scalability from basic abstractions to complex cognitive structures
- Framework shows potential to address Fodor and Pylyshyn's Systematicity Challenge through its SDR-based hierarchical organization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework builds cognitive architecture elements (LTM, WM) from a simple primitive (Footprint) through hierarchical composition
- Mechanism: The Footprint processes Spatial Distributed Representations (SDRs) to create abstractions from concrete manifestations. These Footprints are organized hierarchically into Cells, Clusters, and Metaclusters, which together form Synthetic Cognition capable of representing elements of classical cognitive architectures
- Core assumption: SDRs are universal data structures that can represent any input type, and hierarchical organization of Footprints can capture the systematicity of cognitive functions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "starting from a simple primitive that only processes Spatial Distributed Representations"
  - [section] "we need our embodiment to transform the signals it collects from the world into SDRs"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on different approaches to AGI but doesn't directly support SDR-based hierarchical construction
- Break condition: If SDRs cannot adequately represent certain input types, or if the hierarchical composition fails to capture necessary cognitive relationships

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Self-Projecting Persistence Principle (SPPP) enables the framework to model reality as latent information that manifests differently under varying conditions
- Mechanism: SPPP states that latent information persists in time and continually reveals itself through manifestations. The framework translates this into representations (Footprints) that persist in memory and self-project by outputting themselves when processing new inputs
- Core assumption: Reality can be modeled as persistent latent information that manifests through sensor data, and this persistence can be captured computationally
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The Self-Projecting Persistence Principle (SPPP) states that any latent information present in the world persists in time and is always manifesting itself"
  - [abstract] "propose a novel way to interpret reality as an information source"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus - this appears to be a novel theoretical contribution
- Break condition: If real-world information does not exhibit the persistence assumed by SPPP, or if manifestations cannot be adequately captured by the framework

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The hierarchical structure of abstractions (perception → sensorimotor → episodic → reasoning) enables scalable cognitive architecture construction
- Mechanism: The framework builds four levels of abstractions, starting with perception abstractions that can be built by any cognitive agent with sensors. Higher levels (sensorimotor, episodic, reasoning) build upon lower ones and depend on agent capabilities
- Core assumption: Cognitive abstractions naturally organize in a hierarchy from concrete to abstract, and this hierarchy can be computationally modeled
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we propose, as a working definition, to group it into four main groups, namely the perception abstractions, the sensorimotor abstractions, the episodic abstractions and the reasoning abstractions"
  - [abstract] "achieves such level of verticality in a seamless scalable hierarchical way"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus mentions hierarchical approaches but doesn't specifically validate this four-level abstraction hierarchy
- Break condition: If cognitive abstractions do not naturally organize in this hierarchy, or if the framework cannot adequately represent higher-level abstractions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)
  - Why needed here: SDRs provide a universal data structure that can represent any input type, enabling the Footprint primitive to be truly input-agnostic
  - Quick check question: What property of SDRs makes them suitable for universal representation across different input modalities?

- Concept: Hierarchical abstraction
  - Why needed here: The framework's ability to build complex cognitive architectures depends on organizing simple Footprints into increasingly abstract structures (Cells → Clusters → Metaclusters)
  - Quick check question: How does the hierarchical organization enable the framework to capture both concrete manifestations and abstract concepts?

- Concept: Pattern matching and recognition
  - Why needed here: Cells function as pattern matching functions that recognize which Footprint best matches a new input, enabling the framework to identify and categorize incoming data
  - Quick check question: What mechanism allows a Cell to determine which Footprint best represents a new input manifestation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Footprint → Cell → Cluster → Metacluster → Synthetic Cognition

- Critical path: Footprint → Cell → Cluster → Metacluster → Synthetic Cognition
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. expressiveness: Using simple averaging for Footprint combination may limit representational power
  - Threshold selection: Fixed threshold across all Footprints in a Cell vs. adaptive thresholds
  - Parallel processing: Full parallel processing of all Cells vs. optimized selective processing

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor abstraction quality: If Footprint averaging produces representations that don't capture essential features
  - Inefficient pattern matching: If Cells cannot efficiently determine which Footprint matches new inputs
  - Hierarchical collapse: If higher-level abstractions fail to build meaningful representations from lower-level ones

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Footprint primitive with simple averaging and test on synthetic SDR data to verify basic abstraction capability
  2. Build a single Cell with multiple Footprints and test pattern matching on MNIST-like data to verify recognition capability
  3. Construct a Cluster hierarchy and test on hierarchical data (e.g., object parts → objects → categories) to verify hierarchical abstraction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific encoding methods are required to transform different types of sensory inputs (e.g., images, sound) into Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) within the framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for encoders to transform signals from the world into SDRs but does not specify the encoding methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the necessity of encoders for converting sensory inputs into SDRs but does not provide details on the encoding techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed descriptions or studies of the encoding methods used to convert various sensory inputs into SDRs within the framework.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the framework ensure consistency between Cells in a Cluster, and what specific mechanisms are employed to maintain this consistency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the need for a consistency mechanism to ensure only the right Cells are updated but does not detail the specific mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses the importance of consistency between Cells but lacks a detailed explanation of how this consistency is achieved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation details or experimental results demonstrating the consistency mechanisms used within the Clusters.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the exact inputs and functionalities of the Procedural Metacluster, and how does it interact with the Motoperceptive and Declarative Metaclusters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the Procedural Metacluster is not fully defined and lacks details on its inputs and interactions with other Metaclusters.
- Why unresolved: The Procedural Metacluster is mentioned as a crucial component for reasoning but is not fully elaborated upon in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive definitions and experimental validations of the Procedural Metacluster's inputs, functionalities, and interactions with other Metaclusters.

## Limitations

- The framework's validation relies primarily on conceptual demonstrations using MNIST rather than comprehensive empirical testing across diverse domains
- Specific encoding methods for transforming different sensory inputs into SDRs are not defined, leaving implementation details unclear
- The Procedural Metacluster component is mentioned but not fully defined, limiting the framework's completeness for reasoning tasks

## Confidence

- Hierarchical SDR-based construction: Medium - conceptual validation provided but lacks extensive empirical demonstration
- Self-Projecting Persistence Principle: Low - novel theoretical contribution without direct empirical support in corpus
- Framework's ability to address Systematicity Challenge: Medium - theoretical claims supported but not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Implement the framework on multiple diverse datasets (vision, language, sensorimotor) to verify SDR-based abstraction works universally, not just for MNIST-style data.

2. **Systematicity challenge validation**: Design experiments specifically targeting Fodor and Pylyshyn's Systematicity Challenge to empirically verify the framework's claimed ability to handle systematic cognitive relationships.

3. **Scalability stress test**: Build increasingly deep hierarchical structures and measure abstraction quality degradation, processing efficiency, and memory requirements to establish practical limits of the approach.
