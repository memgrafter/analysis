# Document-level Causal Relation Extraction with Knowledge-guided Binary Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04752
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04752
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MECI dataset for document-level event-event causal relation extraction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses document-level event-event causal relation extraction (ECRE) by proposing Knowledge-guided Binary Question Answering (KnowQA). The method tackles two key challenges: lack of document-level modeling and causal hallucinations. By constructing document-level event structures and formulating ECRE as a binary question answering task with single-turn and multi-turn strategies, KnowQA demonstrates superior performance over baseline models. Experimental results on MECI and MA VEN-ERE datasets show the approach achieves state-of-the-art results on MECI and exhibits high generalizability with low inconsistency, particularly when fine-tuning large language models on ECRE-specific data.

## Method Summary
The KnowQA method constructs document-level event structures by extending event structures beyond sentence-level AMR graphs, incorporating event arguments and their single-hop relationships across entire documents. It formulates ECRE as a binary question answering task with single-turn strategies for causal identification and multi-turn strategies for both identification and classification. The approach leverages pre-trained models for event detection, argument extraction, and relation extraction to build rich event structures. These structures are then used to generate structured questions for large language models, which are evaluated under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings to extract and classify causal relationships between events.

## Key Results
- KnowQA outperforms baseline models on both MECI and MA VEN-ERE datasets
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MECI dataset
- Demonstrates high generalizability and low inconsistency, especially when using complete event structures after fine-tuning large language models
- Shows significant performance improvements under fine-tuning settings compared to zero-shot approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge-guided event structure construction addresses the lack of document-level modeling in ECRE
- Mechanism: The method extends event structures beyond sentence-level AMR graphs by incorporating event arguments and their single-hop relationships across entire documents. This creates richer contextual representations that capture implicit causal relationships spanning multiple sentences.
- Core assumption: Event arguments and their relationships contain sufficient information to represent document-level semantics needed for causal relation extraction
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we leverage cross-task knowledge to construct document-level event structures to enrich event information"
  - [section 3.2] "we extend the definition proposed by Automatic Content Extraction (ACE), consisting of event mentions and event arguments (Frisoni et al., 2021), with the single-hop relationships of arguments"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus only shows related papers on event structures but no direct evidence of this specific mechanism's effectiveness
- Break condition: If event argument extraction models perform poorly or if the single-hop relationships fail to capture relevant semantic connections, the document-level modeling benefit disappears

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Binary QA formulation with single-turn and multi-turn strategies addresses causal hallucinations
- Mechanism: Single-turn QA identifies causal existence while multi-turn QA classifies specific relation types, providing structured supervision that reduces LLM tendency to hallucinate causal relationships. The multi-turn approach iteratively asks about specific relation types, preventing the model from making broad causal assumptions.
- Core assumption: LLMs can be guided by structured question-answering to make more accurate causal judgments than direct text classification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we formulate ECRE as a binary question answering (QA) task with single-turn (for identification) and multi-turn (for identification and classification) strategies"
  - [section 3.3] "multi-turn QA is for identifying and classifying the relationships, adding specific relation types in the questions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus mentions related QA-based approaches but no direct evidence of hallucination mitigation
- Break condition: If LLMs still generate positive responses to all questions in multi-turn setting, the hallucination mitigation fails regardless of question structure

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning on ECRE-specific data significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings
- Mechanism: Training on labeled causal relation examples allows the model to learn task-specific patterns and reduces inconsistency between different question formulations. Fine-tuning adapts the LLM's reasoning to the specific causal relation schema.
- Core assumption: Task-specific fine-tuning provides more effective supervision than in-context learning alone for complex causal reasoning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of event structures on document-level ECRE and the effectiveness of KnowQA by achieving state-of-the-art on the MECI dataset"
  - [section 4.4] "after fine-tuning Flan-T5Large, it outperformed all baselines and achieved state-of-the-art"
  - [section 4.6] "Under the fine-tuning setting, Flan-T5Large had a minimal inconsistency"
- Break condition: If fine-tuned model performance does not exceed zero-shot performance on held-out data, the fine-tuning approach fails to capture task-specific patterns

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event Causality Identification (ECI) vs Causal Relation Classification (CRC)
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly separates these as two subtasks - ECI identifies existence of causal relationships while CRC classifies them into specific types (Cause/Effect/Precondition)
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between identifying that two events are causally related versus classifying what type of causal relationship exists between them?

- Concept: Document-level vs sentence-level event modeling
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts its document-level approach with sentence-level AMR graphs, showing how cross-sentence causal relationships require broader context
  - Quick check question: Why might causal relationships between events span multiple sentences rather than being confined to single sentences?

- Concept: Cross-task knowledge transfer in IE
  - Why needed here: The method leverages models trained for event detection, argument extraction, and relation extraction to build event structures for causal relation extraction
  - Quick check question: How can knowledge from related IE tasks (like entity extraction) help improve performance on a target task like causal relation extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document -> Event detection -> Argument extraction -> Relation extraction -> Event structure assembly -> QA formulation -> LLM inference -> Final prediction

- Critical path: Document → Event detection → Argument extraction → Relation extraction → Event structure assembly → QA formulation → LLM inference → Final prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained IE models vs end-to-end fine-tuning: Pre-trained models provide richer event structures but may introduce errors from the pipeline
  - Single-turn vs multi-turn QA: Single-turn is faster but less precise for classification; multi-turn provides better supervision but requires more inference calls
  - Zero-shot vs fine-tuning: Zero-shot is more generalizable but less accurate; fine-tuning achieves better performance but requires labeled data

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision despite high recall suggests causal hallucination issues
  - Poor inter-sentence performance indicates event structures aren't capturing cross-sentence context
  - High inconsistency between reversed question directions suggests LLM schema understanding problems

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test event structure construction pipeline independently on a held-out document to verify it produces coherent event-argument relationships
  2. Compare single-turn vs multi-turn QA performance on a small validation set to identify which formulation works better for identification vs classification
  3. Measure inconsistency rates across different causal expressions to find the most reliable formulation before full-scale experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Hallucination Analysis**: How can we directly measure hallucination rates rather than inferring them from comparative performance?
- **Error Propagation**: What is the impact of errors in the event structure construction pipeline on final causal relation extraction performance?
- **Cross-Lingual Generalization**: How well does KnowQA perform on non-English datasets beyond the English-centric evaluation presented?

## Limitations

- The evaluation primarily focuses on English datasets, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Error propagation from the pipeline components (event detection, argument extraction) is not thoroughly analyzed
- Direct measurement of hallucination mitigation is lacking - evidence is primarily comparative rather than direct measurement of hallucination rates

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The superiority of KnowQA over baseline models on MECI dataset (Section 4.4 results)
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of document-level event structures for causal relation extraction (based on relative performance gains)
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that multi-turn QA specifically mitigates causal hallucinations (lack of direct hallucination measurement)

## Next Checks

1. **Hallucination Analysis**: Measure direct hallucination rates by comparing KnowQA predictions against human annotations specifically designed to identify false causal inferences, not just overall accuracy.

2. **Error Propagation Study**: Analyze how errors in the event structure construction pipeline (event detection → argument extraction → relation extraction) affect final causal relation extraction performance.

3. **Cross-Lingual Evaluation**: Test KnowQA on non-English datasets to verify the claimed generalizability beyond the English-centric evaluation presented.
