# Chain of Stance: Stance Detection with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04649
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04649
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: CoS achieves 76.43 F1 in zero-shot and 79.84 F1 in few-shot settings on SemEval 2016, outperforming 7 baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Chain of Stance (CoS), a novel approach for stance detection using large language models (LLMs). The method decomposes the complex task of stance detection into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, leveraging LLMs' language understanding and encyclopedic knowledge. CoS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the SemEval 2016 dataset, achieving F1 scores of 76.43 in zero-shot and 79.84 in few-shot settings. The approach also provides improved interpretability by explicitly modeling the reasoning process behind stance judgments.

## Method Summary
Chain of Stance (CoS) is a prompting method that guides large language models through a 6-step sequential reasoning process for stance detection. The method breaks down stance detection into: contextual understanding, main idea interpretation, emotional attitude analysis, stance comparison, logical reasoning, and final decision. By decomposing the task into these intermediate steps, CoS leverages LLMs' language understanding capabilities and encyclopedic knowledge to act as expert stance detectors. The approach uses detailed prompts to guide LLMs through each step, building upon previous reasoning to arrive at a final stance judgment.

## Key Results
- CoS achieves state-of-the-art F1 score of 76.43 in zero-shot learning on SemEval 2016 dataset
- In few-shot learning setting, CoS outperforms baselines with F1 score of 79.84
- CoS shows consistent improvement across all 5 target categories in the SemEval 2016 dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CoS improves stance detection by decomposing the task into intermediate stance-related assertions
- Mechanism: The method breaks down stance detection into a sequence of steps that build upon each other, allowing LLMs to handle smaller, more focused reasoning tasks
- Core assumption: Stance detection can be effectively decomposed into smaller, sequential reasoning steps that LLMs can handle more reliably than the complete task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it positions LLMs as expert stance detectors by decomposing the stance detection process into a series of intermediate, stance-related assertions that culminate in the final judgment"
  - [section] "CoS involves the following steps: Step 1... Step 2... Step 3... Step 4... Step 5... Step 6..."
- Break condition: If LLMs fail to maintain consistency across the sequential steps or if intermediate assertions don't meaningfully contribute to the final judgment

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CoS leverages LLMs' encyclopedic knowledge to improve stance detection accuracy
- Mechanism: By prompting LLMs to perform detailed analysis at each step, the method taps into the model's broad knowledge base about context, emotions, and logical relationships
- Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient encyclopedic knowledge about social contexts, emotions, and logical reasoning to make accurate intermediate judgments
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Given the remarkable language understanding capabilities and encyclopedic prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs)"
  - [section] "This approach leads to significant improvements in classification performance"
- Break condition: If the LLMs lack relevant knowledge for specific contexts or if the encyclopedic knowledge is outdated or inaccurate

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CoS improves interpretability of stance detection results
- Mechanism: By explicitly modeling the reasoning process through intermediate steps, the method provides transparency into how the final stance judgment is reached
- Core assumption: The intermediate steps in the reasoning process can be meaningfully extracted and explained
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach leads to significant improvements in classification performance"
  - [section] "Such analysis enables a deeper understanding of the author's intentions and viewpoints, providing a foundation for further analysis and discussion"
- Break condition: If the intermediate steps are too complex or numerous to be practically interpretable, or if they don't actually explain the reasoning behind the final judgment

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stance detection as a natural language processing task
  - Why needed here: Understanding what stance detection is and its importance in NLP provides context for why CoS is valuable
  - Quick check question: What are the typical categories used in stance detection tasks?

- Concept: Large language models and their capabilities
  - Why needed here: CoS relies on leveraging LLMs' language understanding and encyclopedic knowledge, so understanding these capabilities is crucial
  - Quick check question: What are the key capabilities of LLMs that make them suitable for stance detection?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: CoS is a prompting method that guides LLMs through a specific reasoning process, requiring understanding of how prompts shape LLM behavior
  - Quick check question: How does prompt engineering differ from traditional fine-tuning approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CoS consists of a prompting template that guides LLMs through 6 sequential steps: contextual information extraction -> main idea interpretation -> emotional attitude analysis -> stance comparison -> logical reasoning -> final decision
- Critical path: The most important steps are the initial contextual understanding (Step 1) and the final decision (Step 6), as errors in these will propagate through the entire process
- Design tradeoffs: The sequential nature of CoS adds computational overhead but improves accuracy and interpretability; the detailed prompting may exceed context window limits for some models
- Failure signatures: Common failures include contextual misinterpretation, sentiment analysis errors, insufficient logical reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge limitations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CoS with a simple LLM (e.g., LLaMA2-7B) on a small subset of the SemEval 2016 dataset to verify the basic workflow
  2. Compare CoS performance against a baseline prompt-only approach to measure the impact of the sequential decomposition
  3. Analyze error types by manually reviewing CoS outputs to identify common failure modes and potential improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Chain of Stance (CoS) method perform on stance detection tasks in languages other than English?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on English datasets and models, but does not explicitly test CoS on multilingual stance detection tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or analysis on multilingual datasets, leaving the generalizability of CoS to other languages unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on multilingual stance detection datasets and comparing the performance of CoS across different languages would provide evidence for its generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the length of the prompts on the computational efficiency of the Chain of Stance (CoS) method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the length of the prompts leads to a decrease in the model’s computational efficiency, but does not provide a detailed analysis or comparison.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide quantitative data or experiments to measure the impact of prompt length on computational efficiency, making it difficult to assess the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying prompt lengths and measuring the computational efficiency (e.g., inference time, memory usage) would provide insights into the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Chain of Stance (CoS) method handle complex or ambiguous cases in stance detection, such as sarcasm or irony?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that sentiment analysis errors can occur, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how CoS handles complex cases like sarcasm or irony.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples or experiments to demonstrate how CoS handles complex cases, leaving the robustness of the method in such scenarios unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on datasets containing sarcastic or ironic statements and analyzing the performance of CoS in detecting the correct stance would provide evidence for its robustness in handling complex cases.

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide exact prompt templates for each of the 6 CoS steps, making faithful reproduction challenging
- Experiments are limited to the SemEval 2016 dataset with tweets, raising questions about generalizability to other domains and longer text formats
- The sequential nature of CoS requiring multiple LLM calls may lead to significant computational overhead not discussed in detail

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core concept of decomposing stance detection into sequential reasoning steps is well-explained and logically sound
- Medium Confidence: The reported experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance, though exact prompt templates and few-shot setup details are not fully specified
- Low Confidence: The practical applicability of CoS in real-world scenarios, particularly regarding computational efficiency and generalizability beyond the tested dataset

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study by systematically varying the prompt templates for each CoS step to understand which elements are most critical for performance
2. Evaluate CoS on a different stance detection dataset from a different domain to assess generalizability and identify potential limitations
3. Measure the inference time and cost of CoS compared to baseline methods to analyze the trade-off between improved accuracy and increased computational overhead
