# SA-Attack: Speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack on trajectory prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.12612
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12612
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: SA-Attack significantly increases prediction error and success rate compared to normal predictions while generating more realistic adversarial trajectories

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving to adversarial attacks. The authors propose SA-Attack, a novel method that generates stealthy adversarial trajectories capable of deceiving prediction models while maintaining physical feasibility and smoothness. The approach first searches for model-sensitive trajectory shapes through unconstrained optimization, then reconstructs feasible trajectories using vehicle-following methods and continuous curvature modeling. Experiments on nuScenes and Apolloscape datasets demonstrate that SA-Attack achieves significantly higher prediction error (ADE/FDE) and success rates (MR/ORR) compared to baseline methods, while producing trajectories with smaller speed variations and more realistic acceleration profiles.

## Method Summary
SA-Attack employs a two-stage approach to generate stealthy adversarial trajectories. First, it uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) optimization to find trajectory perturbations that maximize prediction error without physical constraints. These model-sensitive trajectory shapes serve as references for the second stage, where a vehicle-following approach reconstructs physically feasible trajectories using continuous curvature modeling. The method incorporates future trajectory information to ensure smooth transitions between adversarial and real trajectories. Key components include a reference trajectory generator, feasible trajectory reconstructor, continuous curvature model, and pure-pursuit controller, working together to balance attack effectiveness with stealthiness.

## Key Results
- SA-Attack increases ADE and FDE prediction errors significantly compared to normal predictions
- The method achieves higher success rates (MR/ORR) than baseline search methods
- Generated adversarial trajectories show smaller speed variation ranges and more realistic acceleration profiles than previous approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: SA-Attack improves adversarial trajectory generation by first exploring unconstrained sensitive trajectory shapes and then reconstructing feasible trajectories using a vehicle-following approach.
- **Mechanism**: The method first uses PGD optimization to find trajectory perturbations that maximize prediction error without physical constraints. These model-sensitive trajectory shapes are then used as references for reconstructing physically feasible trajectories via a pure-pursuit method that incorporates continuous curvature modeling.
- **Core assumption**: Trajectory prediction models have sensitive regions in their input space where small perturbations can cause large prediction errors, and these regions can be found without physical constraints.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories."
  - [section]: "First, we search without constraints to obtain trajectory shapes that are sensitive to the trajectory prediction model. Subsequently, we reconstruct the feasible trajectories using vehicle-following method."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains related adversarial attack papers but none specifically describe this two-stage approach of unconstrained search followed by feasible reconstruction.
- **Break condition**: If the unconstrained search fails to find trajectories that significantly impact prediction accuracy, or if the reconstruction phase cannot maintain the model-sensitive characteristics while ensuring physical feasibility.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Continuous curvature modeling ensures smoothness and physical feasibility of adversarial trajectories while maintaining stealthiness.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of using dynamic models, the method employs clothoid arcs with continuous curvature to generate trajectories. This approach ensures smooth transitions between trajectory points and maintains physical constraints like maximum steering angles.
- **Core assumption**: Smooth trajectories with continuous curvature are less likely to be detected as anomalous by autonomous vehicle systems and are more physically realizable.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks."
  - [section]: "As a result of the properties mentioned above, our trajectory's curvature is continuously changing, which guarantees the smoothness and physical feasibility of the generated trajectories."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains papers on adversarial attacks but none specifically discuss continuous curvature modeling for trajectory generation.
- **Break condition**: If the continuous curvature model cannot accurately represent real vehicle motion or if the smoothness constraints prevent generation of sufficiently disruptive trajectories.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Incorporating future trajectory information ensures smooth junctions between adversarial and real trajectories, maintaining attack stealthiness.
- **Mechanism**: The method uses the first state of the future trajectory as the final state for the adversarial trajectory generation, ensuring natural transitions and maintaining the original trajectory intent.
- **Core assumption**: Trajectory prediction models and autonomous systems are sensitive to discontinuities or intent changes at trajectory junctions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Finally, to ensure smooth transitions between the adversarial trajectories and future trajectories, we incorporate information about forthcoming trajectories."
  - [section]: "In the whole process of trajectory generation, we constrain the maximum curvature rate to simulate the maximum steering angle constraints in real applications... we incorporate the real state of the future trajectory in the reference trajectory, when it enters the perceptual range, our generated adversarial trajectory can be naturally biased towards the future real state, which ensures the smoothness of the junction between the adversarial trajectory and the future trajectory."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains related adversarial attack papers but none specifically discuss incorporating future trajectory information for junction smoothness.
- **Break condition**: If incorporating future trajectory information limits the ability to generate disruptive adversarial trajectories or if the junction smoothness requirement prevents effective attacks.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Reference Trajectory Generator → Feasible Trajectory Reconstructor → Continuous Curvature Model → Pure-Pursuit Controller
- **Critical path**: Reference Trajectory Generator → Feasible Trajectory Reconstructor → Continuous Curvature Model → Pure-Pursuit Controller
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Unconstrained vs. constrained search: Initial unconstrained search allows finding sensitive regions but requires later reconstruction for feasibility
  - Smoothness vs. disruption: Continuous curvature ensures stealthiness but may limit maximum attack effectiveness
  - Future information incorporation: Improves junction smoothness but may reduce attack impact
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor attack performance: May indicate the unconstrained search isn't finding sensitive regions or reconstruction is smoothing out disruptive features
  - Infeasible trajectories: Could indicate continuous curvature model parameters are misconfigured or vehicle-following constraints are too restrictive
  - Anomalous detection: May suggest junction smoothness is insufficient or trajectories violate physical constraints
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare attack success rate with and without unconstrained initial search to validate the two-stage approach
  2. Test trajectory smoothness metrics (curvature variation, acceleration profiles) to verify continuous curvature model implementation
  3. Evaluate junction smoothness by measuring discontinuities between adversarial and future trajectories with different future information incorporation strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to only two prediction models (Trajectron++ and Grip++), which may not generalize to other architectures
- The method's reliance on history trajectory data raises questions about effectiveness when adversarial trajectories must deviate significantly from historical patterns
- Computational overhead of the two-stage search-and-reconstruction process is not quantified, leaving uncertainty about real-time attack feasibility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that SA-Attack increases prediction error metrics (ADE/FDE) and success rates (MR/ORR) is well-supported by the experimental results showing consistent improvements over baseline methods.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that SA-Attack generates more realistic and feasible trajectories is supported by smaller speed variation ranges, but lacks direct comparison to real-world trajectory distributions.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim about achieving better attack performance for models with higher prediction accuracy is based on limited model diversity and needs broader validation across different model architectures.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-model Generalization**: Test SA-Attack against additional trajectory prediction models (e.g., Social-LSTM, Vanilla LSTM) to verify performance consistency across different architectures.
2. **Real-world Feasibility**: Compare the speed and acceleration profiles of generated adversarial trajectories against real-world driving data to quantify how closely they match actual vehicle behavior patterns.
3. **Detection System Robustness**: Evaluate whether the generated trajectories can bypass detection systems that use multiple criteria beyond prediction error, such as anomaly detection based on vehicle kinematics and traffic rule compliance.
