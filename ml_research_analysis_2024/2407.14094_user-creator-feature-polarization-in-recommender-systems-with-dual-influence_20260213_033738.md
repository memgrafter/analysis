# User-Creator Feature Polarization in Recommender Systems with Dual Influence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.14094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14094
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Recommender systems with dual influence on users and creators inevitably converge to polarization, but top-k truncation can prevent this

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel dynamics model called "user-creator feature dynamics" to study long-term diversity in recommender systems that influence both users and content creators. The authors prove that any recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to converge to polarization, causing diversity loss. They then investigate approaches to mitigate polarization, finding that common diversity-boosting methods are ineffective under dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-k truncation can prevent polarization and improve system diversity. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate these theoretical predictions, showing that more diverse recommendation policies lead to faster polarization in the long run, while efficiency-oriented designs can improve diversity.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a user-creator feature dynamics model where user preferences and creator content styles are represented as vectors on a unit sphere. At each time step, recommendation probabilities are computed via softmax over inner products, then users update their preferences toward recommended creators while creators update their styles toward the average preferences of their audience. The model includes parameters for recommendation sensitivity (β), creator update rate (ηc), and user update rate (ηu). Experiments run for T=1000 steps on synthetic data (d=10, n=50 creators, m=100 users) and MovieLens 20M dataset, measuring creator diversity, recommendation diversity, recommendation relevance, and tendency to polarization.

## Key Results
- Recommender systems with dual influence are mathematically guaranteed to converge to polarization
- Common diversity-promoting approaches backfire under dual influence and accelerate polarization
- Top-k truncation prevents polarization by limiting recommendation probability to top k creators per user
- More diverse recommendation policies lead to faster polarization in the long run
- Efficiency-oriented designs like top-k truncation can improve long-term diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Dual influence between users and creators causes the system to converge to polarization.
- **Mechanism**: User preferences and creator styles evolve simultaneously via feature updates. Each user's preference vector moves toward creators they engage with, while creators shift toward the average preferences of their audience. Over time, all vectors cluster into at most two opposing groups.
- **Core assumption**: Recommendation probabilities are positive for all user-creator pairs, ensuring continuous interaction and convergence.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize"
  - [section 3] "If every creator can be recommended to every user with some non-zero probability, then the dynamics must eventually polarize."
  - [corpus] Weak support: only 5/8 corpus neighbors discuss polarization dynamics.
- **Break condition**: If some user-creator pairs are never recommended (zero probability), the convergence to polarization is prevented.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Top-k truncation prevents polarization and improves diversity.
- **Mechanism**: By limiting recommendations to only the k most relevant creators per user, many creator-user pairs have zero recommendation probability. This breaks the condition that every creator can reach every user, preventing the system from converging to polarization.
- **Core assumption**: Small k reduces the intersection of recommended users across creators, allowing more diverse stable states.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "relevancy-optimizing methods like top-k truncation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system."
  - [section 4] "With top-k truncation, there exist states that form ⌊n/k⌋ clusters and are absorbing."
  - [corpus] No direct support for k-truncation effects.
- **Break condition**: If k is too large (approaching n), the truncation effect vanishes and polarization resumes.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Diversity-boosting approaches backfire under dual influence.
- **Mechanism**: Diversity objectives that explore user interests in the short term cause creators to move toward similar user preferences, accelerating polarization. The myopic diversity gain is outweighed by long-term loss of creation diversity.
- **Core assumption**: Creator updates are based on the sets of users recommended to them; more uniform recommendations lead to more overlapping user sets and faster convergence to consensus.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence"
  - [section 4] "myopically optimizing recommendation diversity might hurt the long-term creation diversity"
  - [corpus] Weak support: only one neighbor discusses diversity's effect on polarization.
- **Break condition**: If creator updates are decoupled from user recommendations, diversity-boosting may retain benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Absorbing Markov chain
  - **Why needed here**: The proof of inevitable polarization relies on showing that certain states are absorbing and that the chain will eventually enter one of them.
  - **Quick check question**: If a state is absorbing and reachable from almost all states, what happens to the chain in the long run?

- **Concept**: Cosine similarity and inner product on unit sphere
  - **Why needed here**: User preferences and creator styles are represented as vectors on the unit sphere; relevance is computed via inner product, and updates are projections back onto the sphere.
  - **Quick check question**: Given two unit vectors, how does their inner product relate to the angle between them?

- **Concept**: Convex cone and normalization
  - **Why needed here**: Creator updates are based on weighted averages of user vectors; normalization projects back to the sphere. The convex cone property ensures inner products remain positive when starting positive.
  - **Quick check question**: If all vectors in a convex cone have positive inner product with a fixed vector, does their normalized average also have positive inner product?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User feature vectors -> Recommendation probability function -> Creator update rule <- User update rule <- Creator feature vectors

- **Critical path**:
  1. Initialize user and creator embeddings on unit sphere
  2. At each step: compute softmax probabilities → sample recommendations → update features → project back to sphere
  3. Measure diversity metrics after each step

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Recommendation sensitivity β: higher β → more relevance, lower diversity; lower β → more diversity short-term, faster polarization long-term
  - Update rates ηu, ηc: higher rates → faster polarization; lower rates → slower dynamics
  - Top-k truncation k: small k → more clusters, higher creation diversity; large k → faster polarization

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Creator diversity drops to near zero while recommendation relevance stays high → polarization
  - User diversity remains high but creation diversity collapses → filter bubble
  - Both measures high initially then both drop → runaway polarization

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Vary β from 0 to ∞; observe creator diversity and tendency to polarization over time
  2. Vary top-k truncation k; compare diversity metrics and final cluster count
  3. Add small uniform traffic; confirm it causes polarization under dual influence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: What is the exact rate of convergence of the user-creator feature dynamics to polarization under the conditions of Theorem 3.3?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper states that Theorem 3.3 does not characterize the rate of convergence, leaving it as an open question.
- **Why unresolved**: The proof of Theorem 3.3 relies on an absorbing Markov chain argument, which does not provide information about the rate of convergence.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A detailed analysis of the dynamics, possibly involving techniques from Markov chain theory or other mathematical tools, could provide insights into the rate of convergence.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How do the results of this paper generalize to impact functions g that do not satisfy the sign function assumption?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper states that all results can be generalized to other g functions satisfying similar conditions as f, but the details are left as future work.
- **Why unresolved**: The proof of Theorem 3.3 relies on the sign function assumption for g, and generalizing the results to other g functions requires further investigation.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A rigorous proof that extends the results to a broader class of g functions, possibly involving different techniques or assumptions, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the long-term effects of cold start on the polarization of recommender systems with dual influence?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions cold start in the context of newly published items and discusses its potential impact on the conditions of Theorem 3.3, but does not provide a detailed analysis.
- **Why unresolved**: The interaction between cold start and the dual influence dynamics is complex and requires further investigation.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comprehensive study of the effects of cold start on the long-term diversity and polarization of recommender systems, possibly involving simulations or empirical data, would provide insights into this question.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes idealized conditions that may not fully capture real-world recommendation systems
- Empirical validation relies primarily on synthetic data with limited real-world support from MovieLens dataset
- Paper doesn't explore impact of different recommendation algorithms beyond softmax-based approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Mathematical proof of guaranteed polarization under dual influence (Mechanism 1) and theoretical analysis of top-k truncation preventing polarization (Mechanism 2)
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical results showing polarization in synthetic and MovieLens data, and claim that diversity-promoting methods backfire (Mechanism 3)
- **Medium Confidence**: Conclusion that relevancy-optimizing methods can improve long-term diversity, based primarily on synthetic experiments

## Next Checks

1. Test the dual influence model with alternative recommendation algorithms (e.g., two-tower models, matrix factorization) to verify robustness of polarization claims
2. Conduct longer-term experiments (T > 1000) to observe the full convergence trajectory and validate the absorbing state predictions
3. Evaluate the model with additional real-world datasets from different domains (e-commerce, news, music) to assess generalizability beyond MovieLens
