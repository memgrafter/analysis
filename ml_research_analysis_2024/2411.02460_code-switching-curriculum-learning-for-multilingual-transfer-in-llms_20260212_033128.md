# Code-Switching Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Transfer in LLMs

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02460

- Primary result: Code-Switching Curriculum Learning (CSCL) improves cross-lingual transfer, achieving 4.3% and 9.5% gains on Korean benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Code-Switching Curriculum Learning (CSCL), a novel training method that improves cross-lingual transfer in large language models by mimicking human language acquisition patterns. CSCL progressively trains models through three stages: token-level code-switching, sentence-level code-switching, and finally monolingual corpora. The approach addresses the limitations of traditional monolingual pre-training by enabling models to better leverage knowledge across languages while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experiments with Qwen 2 demonstrate significant performance improvements on Korean benchmarks and show promise for low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
CSCL implements a curriculum-based training strategy that mirrors how humans learn languages through progressive code-switching. The method consists of three sequential stages: first, token-level code-switching introduces bilingual tokens in parallel sentences; second, sentence-level code-switching mixes full sentences from different languages; third, monolingual corpora training consolidates language-specific knowledge. This progressive approach allows the model to first understand bilingual relationships at the token level, then grasp sentence-level patterns, and finally master individual languages. The curriculum design aims to create stronger cross-lingual connections while preventing the model from forgetting previously learned language patterns.

## Key Results
- Qwen 2 trained with CSCL achieved 4.3% improvement on K-MMLU benchmark compared to traditional monolingual pre-training
- CLIcK benchmark showed 9.5% performance gain with CSCL training
- CSCL successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting in English while improving Korean language transfer
- The method enhanced cross-lingual consistency and generation quality without introducing unintended code-switching behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CSCL works by leveraging the cognitive principle that progressive language mixing enhances learning efficiency. By starting with token-level code-switching, the model builds fundamental bilingual associations before advancing to more complex sentence-level patterns. This staged approach prevents the model from being overwhelmed by full language mixing too early, while still establishing the cross-lingual connections needed for effective transfer. The final monolingual stage consolidates these connections into stable language representations, creating a model that can fluidly navigate between languages while maintaining strong monolingual performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Code-switching**: The alternation between two languages within a single conversation or text. Needed to establish the theoretical foundation for how humans naturally blend languages during acquisition. Quick check: Verify the paper defines and contextualizes code-switching before introducing CSCL.

**Curriculum learning**: Training models with gradually increasing complexity. Required to understand the staged approach of CSCL. Quick check: Confirm the paper explains why progressive training benefits language model performance.

**Catastrophic forgetting**: When models lose previously learned knowledge when acquiring new skills. Critical for understanding why traditional bilingual training fails. Quick check: Ensure the paper quantifies forgetting before and after CSCL implementation.

**Cross-lingual transfer**: The ability to apply knowledge from one language to another. Central to evaluating CSCL's effectiveness. Quick check: Verify benchmark selection specifically measures transfer capabilities.

**Token-level vs sentence-level processing**: Different granularities of language representation. Needed to understand the two code-switching stages. Quick check: Confirm the paper distinguishes between these levels and their respective training objectives.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Pre-training data -> Token-level CSCL stage -> Sentence-level CSCL stage -> Monolingual consolidation -> Fine-tuned multilingual model

**Critical path**: The progression through curriculum stages is essential - skipping stages or reordering them would defeat the pedagogical design and likely degrade performance.

**Design tradeoffs**: The staged approach sacrifices some training efficiency for better knowledge transfer, but the empirical gains suggest this tradeoff is worthwhile for multilingual applications.

**Failure signatures**: If CSCL fails, expect either (1) no improvement over baseline training, (2) degraded performance on source language, or (3) unintended code-switching in generation outputs.

**First experiments**: (1) Verify baseline monolingual training performance on target language, (2) Test token-level CSCL stage alone, (3) Compare sentence-level CSCL against random code-switching.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is limited primarily to Korean-to-English transfer and one additional low-resource language (Tamil), raising questions about generalizability to other language pairs
- Absence of ablation studies makes it unclear whether all three curriculum stages are necessary for the observed improvements
- No investigation of computational overhead or training efficiency impacts compared to standard monolingual pre-training

## Confidence

**CSCL improves multilingual transfer performance**: High confidence - Supported by consistent improvements across multiple Korean benchmarks and one additional language (Tamil).

**CSCL mitigates catastrophic forgetting**: Medium confidence - While improvements are shown, the evaluation metrics for measuring forgetting are not explicitly detailed, and comparisons to other forgetting mitigation techniques are absent.

**CSCL reduces spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment**: Low confidence - This claim is largely theoretical, with minimal empirical validation beyond the assertion that CSCL helps models learn safety concepts across languages.

## Next Checks

1. Test CSCL across diverse language pairs (e.g., high-resource to low-resource, typologically distant languages) to establish broader generalizability beyond Korean and Tamil.

2. Conduct ablation studies removing each curriculum stage to quantify their individual contributions and determine if a simplified version could achieve similar results.

3. Measure training efficiency metrics (FLOPs, wall-clock time, memory usage) to compare CSCL's practical resource requirements against standard monolingual pre-training.
