# Navigation with VLM framework: Towards Going to Any Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02787
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Training-free VLM framework achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance using open-set language goals

## Executive Summary
NavVLM introduces a training-free framework that leverages open-source vision-language models (VLMs) to enable autonomous navigation toward open-set language goals in unknown indoor environments. The method employs VLMs as a cognitive core to interpret environmental observations and provide directional guidance, eliminating the need for object-centric approaches or detailed human instructions. NavVLM integrates perception, path planning, and a backup navigation strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object-specific navigation tasks with high Success Weighted by Path Length (SPL) scores across Matterport 3D, Habitat Matterport 3D, and Gibson datasets. The framework demonstrates robust generalization, handling both object-centric and abstract language goals, validated through simulation and real-world robot experiments. Notably, NavVLM achieves effective navigation using smaller VLMs, minimizing computational demands while maintaining high success rates.

## Method Summary
NavVLM is a training-free framework that uses vision-language models as its cognitive core for autonomous indoor navigation. The system takes RGB-D observations and pose data as input, processes them through a VLM to generate directional guidance, and converts this guidance into short-term target areas via voxelization. A Fast Marching Method-based path planner navigates the robot toward these targets while avoiding obstacles. When VLM guidance is unavailable, the framework falls back to nearest frontier exploration. The system operates in unknown environments without requiring detailed prior maps or object detection, supporting both object-centric and abstract language goals.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art SPL scores in object-specific navigation across Matterport 3D, Habitat Matterport 3D, and Gibson datasets
- Successfully handles open-set language goals including abstract concepts like "the middle of the hall" and "somewhere I can eat dinner"
- Demonstrates effective navigation using smaller VLMs (minicpm-v2.6) with minimal computational demands while maintaining high success rates
- Shows robust generalization with VLM guidance dominating 90% of navigation decisions in real-world robot experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VLMs serve as a cognitive core that can interpret environmental observations and provide directional guidance without requiring object-centric approaches.
- Mechanism: The framework leverages VLMs to perceive RGB-D observations and generate text-based directional guidance (e.g., "left", "right", "go straight"), which is then projected into the environment as short-term target areas for path planning.
- Core assumption: VLMs possess sufficient common-sense reasoning to understand abstract language goals and infer navigation-relevant information from observations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NavVLM leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information and constantly provides exploration guidance achieving intelligent navigation with only a neat target rather than a detailed instruction with environment prior."
  - [section III.A] "We utilize VLM to perceive these information with two different prompts... Then together with current observation and top-down map with history trajectory, we ask VLM to provide directional information..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on map parsing and object-oriented navigation but don't directly support VLM common-sense reasoning for abstract navigation goals.
- Break condition: VLMs fail to understand abstract language goals or cannot provide meaningful directional guidance from observations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in object-specific navigation tasks while maintaining low computational cost by using smaller VLMs.
- Mechanism: By using smaller open-source VLMs (e.g., MiniCPM-v2.6) instead of larger models, the framework maintains high performance while being deployable on mobile devices.
- Core assumption: Smaller VLMs retain sufficient reasoning capabilities for effective navigation while being computationally efficient.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NavVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) scores... Notably, NavVLM achieves effective navigation using smaller VLMs, minimizing computational demands while maintaining high success rates."
  - [section IV.B] "We selected minicpm-v2.6 as the cognitive VLM of the agent, with comparison on larger InterVL2-5 series."
  - [section V.C] "Using larger models yields only marginal improvements. The incremental gains do not justify the largely increased computational demands compared to employing smaller VLMs."
- Break condition: Smaller VLMs cannot maintain performance when scaling to more complex environments or more abstract language goals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework handles both object-centric and abstract language goals through VLM's common-sense reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: Unlike object-centric approaches that rely on detection and object-specific templates, NavVLM uses VLMs to reason about goals like "the middle of the hall" or "somewhere I can eat dinner" by understanding context and spatial relationships.
- Core assumption: VLMs can reason about spatial relationships and abstract concepts beyond simple object detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NavVLM is not an object-centric framework and thus has the capability of open goal navigation... Our framework advances previous navigation systems towards open goal languages in various unknown indoor scenes."
  - [section I] "Language goals not anchored onto objects like 'center in the hall', 'a corner in kitchen' are not applicable for these object-centric works."
  - [section III.D] "If the VLM does not provide valid information or explicitly commands 'explore more', the navigation process temporarily reverts to the back-up navigation strategy."
- Break condition: VLMs cannot reason about abstract spatial concepts or fail when goals require understanding beyond visual observation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
  - Why needed here: VLMs serve as the cognitive core that interprets observations and provides navigation guidance, replacing traditional object detection and rule-based systems.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes VLMs from traditional computer vision models in navigation tasks?

- Concept: Path Planning with Voxelization
  - Why needed here: The framework converts VLM text guidance into concrete actions through voxelization of observations and path planning on top-down maps.
  - Quick check question: How does the voxelization process translate RGB-D observations into navigable space for the robot?

- Concept: Open Goal Navigation vs. Object-Oriented Navigation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the distinction helps explain why traditional object-centric approaches fail for abstract goals like "the middle of the hall."
  - Quick check question: What types of language goals can be expressed in open goal navigation that object-oriented navigation cannot handle?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  VLM Core → Text Summarizer → Voxelizer → Path Planner → Robot Action → Termination Module

- Critical path: Observation → VLM Perception → Text Guidance → Voxelization → Path Planning → Robot Action → Termination Check

- Design tradeoffs:
  - VLM size vs. computational cost: Smaller VLMs are sufficient but larger models provide marginal improvements
  - VLM guidance vs. backup navigation: VLM dominates 90% of navigation decisions
  - Abstraction level: Higher-level guidance provides flexibility but requires robust VLM reasoning

- Failure signatures:
  - VLM provides invalid guidance or commands "explore more"
  - Voxelization/projection errors create inaccurate target areas
  - Path planner fails to find valid routes around obstacles
  - Termination module incorrectly identifies goal completion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test VLM perception with simple object goals in controlled environments to verify basic directional guidance works
  2. Evaluate voxelization accuracy by comparing projected guidance areas against ground truth locations
  3. Test backup navigation fallback by disabling VLM guidance and measuring performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the methodology and results, several implicit open questions emerge:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can NavVLM be adapted to handle navigation tasks in dynamic environments where obstacles or targets may move over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on static environments and does not address dynamic changes in the environment or targets during navigation.
- Why unresolved: The framework assumes a fixed environment and static goals, which limits its applicability in real-world scenarios where dynamic changes are common.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing successful navigation in dynamic environments, such as simulations or real-world tests with moving obstacles or targets, would demonstrate the framework's adaptability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can NavVLM be extended to support multi-agent navigation scenarios where multiple robots must coordinate to achieve a common goal?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not discuss multi-agent systems or coordination between multiple robots.
- Why unresolved: The current framework is designed for single-agent navigation and does not account for interactions or coordination between multiple agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of NavVLM's performance in multi-agent navigation tasks, such as simulations or real-world experiments with multiple robots, would show its potential for extension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of NavVLM scale with increasingly complex and ambiguous language goals that require deeper reasoning or contextual understanding?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions NavVLM's ability to handle open-set language goals but does not explore the limits of its reasoning capabilities for highly complex or ambiguous tasks.
- Why unresolved: The framework's effectiveness for simple to moderately complex goals is demonstrated, but its limits for more intricate reasoning tasks are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results testing NavVLM's performance on increasingly complex and ambiguous language goals, such as tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or contextual understanding, would clarify its scalability.

## Limitations

- VLM prompt engineering details are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- The text summarization component's implementation remains unclear - uncertain whether external LLM or VLM handles this task
- Limited quantitative validation of truly abstract goal navigation beyond object-centric tasks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that VLMs can serve as a cognitive core for navigation guidance is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets showing consistent SPL and SR improvements
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about using smaller VLMs while maintaining performance is supported but could benefit from more rigorous ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: The framework's ability to handle abstract language goals is demonstrated but evaluation focuses primarily on object-centric tasks

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments testing VLM performance on truly abstract language goals (e.g., "the brightest spot," "a quiet corner") to validate open goal navigation capabilities beyond object-centric tasks
2. Perform detailed ablation studies comparing different VLM sizes and prompt engineering approaches to quantify trade-offs between computational cost and navigation performance
3. Implement real-world testing in diverse indoor environments with varying lighting conditions, obstacles, and spatial configurations to assess robustness beyond simulation environments
