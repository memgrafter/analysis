# Vision-Language Models under Cultural and Inclusive Considerations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06177
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06177
- Authors: Antonia Karamolegkou; Phillip Rust; Yong Cao; Ruixiang Cui; Anders Søgaard; Daniel Hershcovich
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Vision-language models show varied performance on culturally diverse image captioning tasks, with closed-access models generally outperforming open-access ones, highlighting the need for culturally aware VLMs and more reliable evaluation metrics.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) for culturally diverse image captioning, particularly for assisting visually impaired users. The authors create a survey to gather caption preferences from visually impaired individuals, focusing on the inclusion of cultural information. They then filter the VizWiz dataset to identify implicit cultural concepts, creating a benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across different prompt settings. The results show that while closed-access models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro perform well on both original and culturally annotated captions, open-access models show varied performance. Human evaluation indicates a preference for closed-access model captions, which are often more accurate and detailed.

## Method Summary
The study involves creating a survey to gather caption preferences from visually impaired individuals, filtering the VizWiz dataset to identify implicit cultural concepts, and evaluating VLMs on this filtered dataset using both automatic metrics (BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE) and human evaluation. The researchers compare open-access models (BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, Idefics2, LLaVA-1.6) with closed-access models (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro) across default and culture-specific prompts. The analysis includes error analysis and case studies to understand model performance and challenges in culturally diverse contexts.

## Key Results
- Survey results show visually impaired users value cultural information in image captions, rating helpfulness and importance highly (4.1 and 3.9 out of 5, respectively).
- Closed-access models (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro) outperform open-access models on culturally annotated captions, achieving better performance on newly annotated captions that include cultural information.
- Human evaluation reveals a preference for closed-access model captions, which are often more accurate and detailed, while automatic metrics may not fully capture cultural relevance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cultural information in image captions is both helpful and important for visually impaired users.
- Mechanism: The survey results show that participants rated the helpfulness and importance of cultural information highly (average ratings of 4.1 and 3.9 out of 5, respectively), indicating that cultural details in captions enhance the user experience.
- Core assumption: Visually impaired users value cultural context in image descriptions as much as sighted users would.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Survey results from people with visual impairments rating importance and helpfulness of cultural information in image captions."
  - [section] "Overall, the participants were positive regarding the helpfulness and importance of cultural information in the captions with average ratings of 4.1 and 3.9, respectively."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the corpus doesn't directly support this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the survey sample is not representative of the broader visually impaired population, the mechanism may not generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Filtering VizWiz dataset for implicit cultural concepts creates a challenging benchmark for evaluating VLMs in culturally diverse settings.
- Mechanism: By identifying images with cultural relevance through annotator consensus, the filtered dataset ensures that VLMs are tested on culturally specific content, which is crucial for assessing their performance in real-world scenarios.
- Core assumption: The VizWiz dataset contains sufficient implicit cultural concepts that can be identified and used for evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then filtered VizWiz, an existing dataset with images taken by people who are blind, identifying implicit cultural concepts."
  - [section] "To filter the data we hired a total of 165 annotators... We collected a total of 324 images and 648 captions spanning 60 different identified cultures."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the corpus doesn't provide details on the effectiveness of this filtering approach.
- Break condition: If the annotators fail to identify relevant cultural concepts, the benchmark may not accurately reflect cultural diversity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Closed-access models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro perform better on culturally annotated captions than open-access models.
- Mechanism: The closed-access models have been tuned to generate more descriptive and culturally aware captions, aligning better with human preferences and the newly annotated cultural captions.
- Core assumption: The closed-access models have undergone training or fine-tuning that includes cultural awareness, which is not present in open-access models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While our results for state-of-the-art models are promising, we identify challenges such as hallucination and misalignment of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgment."
  - [section] "Strikingly, Gemini and GPT-4o achieve much better performance on our newly annotated captions that include cultural information than on the original captions... while we observe the opposite for the open-access models."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the corpus doesn't provide details on the training processes of the models.
- Break condition: If the closed-access models are not actually more culturally aware, their superior performance may be due to other factors such as scale or architecture.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VLMs work is crucial for evaluating their performance in culturally diverse image captioning tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are the main components of a VLM and how do they interact to process visual and textual information?

- Concept: Image Captioning
  - Why needed here: Image captioning is the primary task being evaluated, and understanding its nuances is essential for assessing the cultural relevance of the captions.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in generating accurate and culturally aware image captions?

- Concept: Cultural Awareness in AI
  - Why needed here: Cultural awareness is the central theme of the study, and understanding how to measure and improve it in AI models is critical.
  - Quick check question: How can we define and quantify cultural awareness in the context of image captioning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Collection -> Model Evaluation -> Analysis
- Critical path: 1. Create survey to gather caption preferences from visually impaired individuals. 2. Filter VizWiz dataset to identify images with cultural relevance. 3. Evaluate VLMs on the filtered dataset using both automatic and human evaluation methods. 4. Analyze results to identify challenges and areas for improvement.
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the need for culturally diverse data with the availability of such data in existing datasets. Choosing between automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation, considering their respective strengths and weaknesses.
- Failure signatures: Low performance on culturally annotated captions may indicate a lack of cultural awareness in the models. Misalignment between automatic metrics and human judgment suggests that the metrics may not fully capture cultural relevance.
- First 3 experiments: 1. Conduct the survey to determine caption preferences and cultural importance. 2. Filter the VizWiz dataset to identify images with cultural relevance. 3. Evaluate VLMs on the filtered dataset using both automatic and human evaluation methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on culturally diverse image captioning tasks compare when evaluated using automatic metrics versus human judgment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the misalignment of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgment, highlighting that closed-access models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro perform better on newly annotated cultural captions in automatic metrics, but human evaluation shows a preference for cultural prompting despite lower automatic scores.
- Why unresolved: The paper indicates that automatic metrics might not fully capture model performance in culturally diverse contexts, suggesting a need for further investigation into the discrepancies between automatic and human evaluations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the results of automatic metrics and human evaluations across a wider range of culturally diverse datasets and models would provide clarity on the alignment between these evaluation methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific cultural concepts and contexts that vision-language models struggle to accurately identify and describe?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro struggle with identifying foreign currencies, historical figures, and paintings, suggesting that there are cultural concepts that models find challenging.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides examples of specific cultural concepts that models struggle with, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of all potential cultural challenges across different models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of model performance across a broad spectrum of cultural concepts, including less common or nuanced cultural elements, would help identify specific areas where models need improvement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can vision-language models be effectively fine-tuned or prompted to improve their performance on culturally diverse image captioning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that few-shot prompting or fine-tuning the models could improve performance, as seen with InstructBLIP and BLIP-2, which tend to produce shorter and less informative captions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore specific strategies for fine-tuning or prompting models to enhance their cultural awareness and accuracy in image captioning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental studies testing various fine-tuning techniques and prompting strategies on culturally diverse datasets would provide insights into the most effective methods for improving model performance.

## Limitations

- The survey sample size (15 participants) may not be representative of the broader visually impaired population, limiting generalizability.
- The evaluation primarily uses a single dataset (VizWiz), which may not capture the full diversity of cultural contexts.
- The study focuses on English-language captions, potentially missing important cultural nuances in other languages.

## Confidence

- High confidence in the methodology for cultural concept identification and dataset filtering
- Medium confidence in the comparative performance analysis between open and closed-access models
- Medium confidence in the human evaluation results and their interpretation
- Low confidence in the automatic evaluation metrics' ability to capture cultural relevance

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse sample of visually impaired participants to validate survey findings and ensure broader representation.
2. Extend the evaluation to include multilingual VLMs and captions in different languages to assess cross-cultural performance and identify potential language-specific biases.
3. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking user satisfaction and task completion rates when using VLMs with culturally aware versus standard captions in real-world scenarios.
