# Visualizing Temporal Topic Embeddings with a Compass

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Compass-aligned temporal embeddings enable unified word/document/topic spaces with interactive Sankey visualization of topic evolution

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of understanding how topics evolve over time in large text corpora by creating a unified embedding space that combines words, documents, and topics from time-varying text data. The authors propose TTEC (Temporal Topic Embeddings with a Compass), which extends compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling. The method creates global and local embedding spaces that enable direct comparison of word and document representations across time slices, with the TimeLink visualization system illustrating keyword movement between topics over time.

## Method Summary
TTEC creates a compass model (Doc2Vec trained on entire corpus) to establish a global embedding space, then trains time slice models with frozen compass weights to ensure alignment. Local document vectors are projected into the global UMAP space and clustered with HDBSCAN to obtain local topics sharing the same space as global topics. TimeLink visualizes keyword flow between local topics using a Sankey diagram, where nodes represent clusters and colors indicate global topic membership. The method is evaluated on three datasets (MLPC, UN, and Nuclear Corpus) and compared to state-of-the-art dynamic topic modeling approaches.

## Key Results
- TTEC demonstrates competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across varying dataset sizes
- TimeLink effectively visualizes evolution of topics and movement of keywords between topics over time
- Method successfully handles large-scale corpora with millions of documents
- Sankey diagram reveals insights rooted in real-world events through keyword flow visualization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Compass alignment enables direct comparison of word and document embeddings across time slices.
- Mechanism: A single compass model (Doc2Vec trained on entire corpus) creates a frozen hidden layer. Each time slice trains its own Doc2vec model with the compass's hidden weights frozen, forcing time slice embeddings to align to the compass's global embedding space.
- Core assumption: Frozen hidden layer constrains time slice models to produce similar embeddings for same words/documents across time.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology; [section] frozen hidden embedding creates alignment; [corpus] 5.6M articles provide stable compass.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local time slice embeddings can be mapped into global topic space to track topic evolution.
- Mechanism: After training local Doc2Vec models with compass alignment, local document vectors are projected into global UMAP space (built from compass document vectors) and clustered with HDBSCAN.
- Core assumption: Local and global vectors occupy same embedding space, so proximity in UMAP correctly reflects topical similarity.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] local embedding spaces for each slice; [section] local and global vectors occupy same embedding space; [corpus] 28.7B words provide dense representations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sankey diagram effectively visualizes keyword flow between topics over time.
- Mechanism: Keywords clustered into local topics per time slice, clusters matched across time by Euclidean distance in UMAP space, Sankey shows keywords as links flowing between cluster nodes.
- Core assumption: Same keywords appear in each time slice, and their movement between clusters captures topical shifts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] Sankey diagram to visualize flow of keywords; [section] flow emphasizes movement rather than separation; [corpus] 92 time slices handled.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Doc2Vec (PV-DM and PV-DBOW models)
  - Why needed here: TTEC extends compass alignment from Word2Vec to Doc2Vec, enabling aligned document embeddings alongside word embeddings.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between PV-DM and PV-DBOW Doc2Vec models, and when might you choose one over the other?

- Concept: UMAP and HDBSCAN for topic discovery
  - Why needed here: UMAP creates low-dimensional topic space from document vectors, HDBSCAN discovers topic clusters in that space, used for both global and local topics.
  - Quick check question: How does HDBSCAN differ from DBSCAN, and why is it preferred for topic modeling?

- Concept: Sankey diagram construction and interpretation
  - Why needed here: TimeLink uses Sankey diagram to show keyword movement between topic clusters over time.
  - Quick check question: In TimeLink context, what do nodes, links, and colors represent in Sankey diagram?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Compass -> Time Slices -> Global Topic Space -> Local Topics -> Visualization
- Critical path: 1) Train compass Doc2Vec on full corpus; 2) For each time slice: train Doc2Vec with compass weights frozen, project to UMAP, cluster with HDBSCAN; 3) Build global topic descriptions using global word vectors; 4) Generate TimeLink Sankey diagram
- Design tradeoffs: Compass alignment vs. separate embeddings (alignment allows comparison but may be biased); UMAP projection stability (recomputing per slice shows local structure better but prevents comparison); Sankey diagram complexity (more keywords/time slices improve detail but reduce readability)
- Failure signatures: Poor topic coherence (adjust compass training or UMAP/HDBSCAN parameters); Unstable cluster matching (UMAP projection inconsistent); Sankey performance issues (too many keywords/time slices)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train compass on small subset, visualize global topic space with UMAP, verify interpretable topics; 2) Train time slice models on 2-3 consecutive months, project to UMAP, check cluster stability; 3) Generate TimeLink with filtered keyword set (20-30 terms), verify Sankey correctly shows flow

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does TTEC perform compared to other dynamic topic modeling methods in terms of temporal topic coherence and diversity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] TTEC demonstrates competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across temporal datasets of varying size.
- Why unresolved: Paper mentions competitive performance but lacks detailed comparison with other dynamic topic modeling methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive quantitative analysis comparing TTEC's performance with other methods in terms of temporal topic coherence and diversity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can scalability of TimeLink be improved for large datasets with many time slices?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] TimeLink becomes longer and more difficult to view with many time slices, system performance dwindles with lag when scrolling.
- Why unresolved: Paper suggests filtering keywords or increasing time slice granularity but doesn't analyze how these solutions would improve scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of TimeLink performance with different scalability solutions on large datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can visual design of TimeLink be further improved to provide more user control and facilitate deeper understanding of temporal changes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Additional user control could allow more thorough analysis, such as incorporating user input to improve representation where sparse data or significant noise exists.
- Why unresolved: Paper suggests incorporating user input or adding scatterplots but doesn't analyze how these improvements would enhance visual design.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of impact of different visual design improvements on TimeLink usability and effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Performance on smaller datasets may degrade as compass alignment quality depends on substantial corpus size
- Computational scalability limited by Sankey visualization implementation, capped at ~50 time slices
- Hyperparameter sensitivity not explored, particularly for UMAP and HDBSCAN parameters
- Keyword flow interpretation assumes stability across time slices without quantifying movement frequency

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Compass alignment enables unified embedding space - technically sound mechanism with well-established theoretical justification in Word2Vec literature.

**Medium Confidence**: TTEC provides competitive topic relevancy and diversity - quantitative metrics provided but comparison methods differ in assumptions and hyperparameter tuning not controlled.

**Low Confidence**: TimeLink effectively reveals real-world events - qualitative examples provided but lacks systematic validation against ground truth events.

## Next Checks
1. **Compass Stability Analysis**: Systematically vary compass training corpus size (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%) and measure how topic coherence and cross-time slice alignment quality degrade with smaller training sets.

2. **Hyperparameter Ablation Study**: Vary UMAP n_neighbors (5, 15, 30) and HDBSCAN minimum cluster size (5, 15, 30) across multiple time slices to identify which parameters most impact topic stability and visualization clarity.

3. **Ground Truth Event Correlation**: Select 3-5 known temporal events and quantify how well TTEC's topic evolution captures these events using human annotation of topic-document relevance at event timepoints.
