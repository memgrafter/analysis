# Bridging the Gap: Protocol Towards Fair and Consistent Affect Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.06841
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06841
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposes a protocol for fair and consistent affect analysis by annotating six databases for demographic attributes and redefining partitioning to address biases.

## Executive Summary
This work tackles the critical challenge of fairness in automatic affect analysis by addressing biases across demographic attributes such as age, gender, and race. The authors introduce a novel protocol that involves annotating six affective databases with demographic information and proposing a new partitioning scheme to ensure fairness in model evaluation. Through extensive experiments, the study demonstrates that models trained on these new partitions exhibit superior fairness and performance compared to those trained on traditional partitions. The results highlight the inadequacy of prior assessments and underscore the importance of considering demographic attributes in affect analysis research.

## Method Summary
The study focuses on automatic affect analysis tasks, including expression recognition, action unit detection, and valence-arousal estimation, with an emphasis on fairness evaluation across demographic attributes. The authors annotate six affective databases (AffectNet, RAF-DB, DISFA, EmotioNet, GFT, RAF-AU) for demographic attributes such as age, gender, and race. A new protocol is proposed for partitioning these databases into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring demographic balance and subject independence. Baseline and state-of-the-art models (ResNet variants, ViT, Swin, ConvNeXt) are trained and evaluated on both original and new partitions using metrics like F1 score, CCC, Statistical Parity, and Demographic Parity Difference.

## Key Results
- Models trained on new partitions showed improved fairness metrics, including Statistical Parity and Demographic Parity Difference, compared to those trained on original partitions.
- The study revealed the inadequacy of prior assessments, demonstrating that traditional partitions often lead to biased model performance.
- The proposed protocol led to better overall recognition rates, challenging the conventional notion of a trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed protocol works by addressing the inherent biases in traditional dataset partitioning methods. By annotating datasets with demographic attributes and ensuring balanced representation in training, validation, and test sets, the protocol mitigates the risk of models learning and perpetuating biases. This approach leads to more equitable model performance across different demographic groups, as evidenced by improved fairness metrics and overall recognition rates.

## Foundational Learning
- **Demographic-aware evaluation**: Why needed? To address biases in affect analysis models across different demographic groups. Quick check: Ensure models are evaluated on balanced demographic distributions.
- **Fairness metrics**: Why needed? To quantify and compare the fairness of models across demographic attributes. Quick check: Use Statistical Parity and Demographic Parity Difference to assess fairness.
- **Dataset partitioning protocol**: Why needed? To create training, validation, and test sets that are representative and unbiased across demographics. Quick check: Verify that partitions maintain demographic balance and subject independence.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Fairness Evaluation -> Performance Assessment
- **Critical path**: Data annotation and partitioning -> Model training on new partitions -> Fairness and performance evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing demographic representation in partitions vs. maintaining sufficient data for each subgroup; prioritizing fairness vs. overall accuracy.
- **Failure signatures**: Imbalanced demographic distributions leading to biased model performance; inadequate preprocessing causing poor generalization.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Replicate the demographic partitioning protocol on AffectNet and RAF-DB.
  2. Train and evaluate a baseline model (e.g., ResNet) on both original and new partitions.
  3. Compare fairness metrics (SP, DPD) and performance (F1, CCC) across partitions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does prioritizing fairness in affect analysis models lead to improved overall performance across all demographic groups, or is there a trade-off between fairness and accuracy?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper discusses the relationship between fairness and overall recognition performance, noting that models prioritizing fairness also demonstrated superior overall recognition rates, challenging the conventional notion of a trade-off.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper suggests a positive correlation between fairness and overall performance, it does not definitively prove causation or rule out scenarios where prioritizing fairness might negatively impact accuracy in certain contexts.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comprehensive study comparing the performance of affect analysis models across diverse demographic groups, with varying levels of emphasis on fairness, could provide clearer insights into the relationship between fairness and accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can affect analysis models be designed to effectively handle the inherent challenges of achieving fairness for attributes like age and race, which are more difficult to balance in datasets?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper highlights the challenges of achieving fairness for attributes like age and race, noting that these attributes often have imbalanced distributions in datasets, making it difficult for models to generalize effectively.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper identifies the problem but does not provide a definitive solution for addressing the challenges of fairness for attributes like age and race, which require more sophisticated techniques and approaches.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Research exploring novel techniques for balancing datasets and improving model generalization for challenging attributes like age and race, along with empirical evaluations of their effectiveness, could provide valuable insights.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the long-term implications of incorporating fairness considerations into affect analysis research, and how can these considerations be integrated into the broader development of AI systems?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering demographic attributes and fairness in affect analysis research, suggesting that this approach provides a foundation for developing more equitable methodologies.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper advocates for fairness in affect analysis, it does not delve into the broader implications of this approach for the development of AI systems in general, nor does it explore how fairness considerations can be integrated into the design and deployment of AI systems across different domains.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comprehensive analysis of the impact of fairness considerations on the development and deployment of AI systems across various domains, along with case studies and best practices, could provide valuable insights into the long-term implications of this approach.

## Limitations
- The specific implementation details for the partitioning protocol and demographic annotation process remain unclear, affecting reproducibility.
- The study does not report intersectional fairness metrics or error rate disparities, limiting the comprehensiveness of the fairness analysis.
- The experiments focus on a fixed set of models and databases, which may not generalize to all affect analysis scenarios or emerging architectures.

## Confidence
- **High**: The necessity of demographic-aware evaluation and the inadequacy of previous benchmarks are well-supported by experimental evidence.
- **Medium**: The improvements in fairness metrics and model performance on new partitions are demonstrated, but the lack of implementation details and comprehensive fairness analysis introduces uncertainty.
- **Low**: The generalizability of the proposed protocol and the long-term impact on affect analysis research are not fully established due to limited scope and unreported intersectional fairness measures.

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate the demographic partitioning protocol** on at least two databases (e.g., AffectNet and RAF-DB) to verify the feasibility and fairness of the new partitions.
2. **Evaluate intersectional fairness** by measuring disparities in error rates and calibration across demographic subgroups (e.g., age-gender-race combinations).
3. **Test model robustness** by training and evaluating additional architectures (e.g., EfficientNet, MobileNet) and comparing their fairness and performance on both original and new partitions.
