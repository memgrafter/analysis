# A tutorial on learning from preferences and choices with Gaussian Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.11782
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11782
- Reference count: 0
- This tutorial presents a comprehensive framework for preference and choice learning using Gaussian Processes (GPs)

## Executive Summary
This tutorial presents a comprehensive framework for preference and choice learning using Gaussian Processes (GPs). The framework addresses the problem of learning latent utility functions or preference relations from pairwise comparisons, label preferences, and choice data. The approach models preferences using GPs with tailored likelihood functions that handle various sources of irrationality, including noisy utilities, limits of discernibility, and multiple conflicting utilities. The tutorial demonstrates applications across multiple domains and establishes connections to recommender systems, showing how preference models can improve recommendation accuracy.

## Method Summary
The tutorial introduces a GP-based framework for learning from preferences and choices, employing tailored likelihood functions to model different preference scenarios. For object preferences, nine models are introduced ranging from consistent preferences to erroneous preferences and multiple utilities. For label preferences, models based on Gaussian and Gumbel noise are presented, along with a model for label ordering data. For choice data, models for rational and pseudo-rational choice functions are introduced. The framework handles various sources of irrationality including noisy utilities, limits of discernibility, and multiple conflicting utilities, with applications demonstrated on real-world datasets including transportation mode preference, ranked data for gaming platforms, and ellipse preferences.

## Key Results
- Nine models for object preferences covering consistent to erroneous preferences and multiple utilities
- Gaussian and Gumbel noise models for label preferences with ordering capabilities
- Rational and pseudo-rational choice function models for choice data
- High accuracy demonstrated across real-world datasets including transportation, gaming, and geometric preferences
- Connection established between preference models and improved recommender system performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging Gaussian Processes to model latent utility functions that capture underlying preference structures. The tailored likelihood functions allow the models to handle various types of preference data and sources of noise or irrationality. By representing preferences as noisy observations of latent utilities, the GP framework naturally incorporates uncertainty quantification and provides principled ways to handle different preference scenarios, from consistent to inconsistent choices.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian Processes for regression and classification - why needed: Provides probabilistic framework for modeling latent utilities; quick check: Can reproduce basic GP regression on synthetic data
- Pairwise comparison models - why needed: Foundation for modeling preference relationships; quick check: Can implement Bradley-Terry model
- Likelihood function design - why needed: Enables modeling of different preference scenarios; quick check: Can derive likelihood for simple preference model
- Utility function concepts - why needed: Core representation of preferences in decision theory; quick check: Can define and manipulate utility functions
- Choice theory fundamentals - why needed: Provides theoretical basis for rational choice modeling; quick check: Can explain rational choice axioms
- Noise modeling approaches - why needed: Accounts for real-world preference uncertainty; quick check: Can implement Gaussian and Gumbel noise models

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Input -> Preference Model Selection -> GP Training -> Inference -> Prediction/Output

Critical path: Data preprocessing and format conversion → Model selection based on preference type → GP hyperparameter optimization → Inference for new predictions

Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. model expressiveness (simpler models scale better but capture less complexity), Handling of intransitivity (some models assume rationality while others explicitly model errors), Flexibility vs. interpretability (more complex models fit better but are harder to interpret)

Failure signatures: Poor fit indicated by high residuals in predictions, Model complexity issues shown by overfitting on training data, Intransitivity problems revealed by cyclic preference patterns

First experiments:
1. Implement and test basic GP regression on synthetic preference data
2. Apply Bradley-Terry model to pairwise comparison dataset
3. Compare Gaussian vs Gumbel noise models on label preference data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes latent utility functions can adequately capture human preferences, which may fail for complex, context-dependent decision making
- Limited exploration of how well models handle preference intransitivity and cyclic preferences
- Most models assume static utility functions across different contexts, potentially missing important contextual variations

## Confidence
High - Gaussian Process framework is well-established and likelihood functions are mathematically sound
Medium - Scalability claims need more empirical evidence with large datasets
Low - Limited validation of context-dependent preference handling

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive scalability testing with datasets exceeding 10,000 observations to verify computational claims and identify practical limitations
2. Implement rigorous validation on datasets known to contain intransitive preferences to assess model robustness
3. Test the framework on preference data from multiple cultural contexts to evaluate generalizability assumptions
