core_contribution: The paper proposes REMALIS, a framework for training large language
  models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative
  multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The key idea is to allow agents to maintain
  and propagate private intentions (goals and sub-tasks) to achieve common grounding
  and reduce miscoordination.

# Towards Collaborative Intelligence: Propagating Intentions and Reasoning for Multi-Agent Coordination with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.12532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12532
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework reduces miscoordination errors and enables emergent coordinated behaviors in multi-agent systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces REMALIS, a framework that trains large language models as collaborative agents capable of coordinated behaviors in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. The key innovation centers on intention propagation, where agents maintain and broadcast private intentions (goals and sub-tasks) to achieve common grounding and reduce miscoordination. The framework incorporates a propagation network that transforms these intentions into teammate-specific communication messages and includes bidirectional feedback loops between execution agents and planning modules for dynamic re-planning. Results demonstrate improved performance over single-agent baselines and state-of-the-art MARL methods on traffic flow prediction and web-based activities datasets.

## Method Summary
The REMALIS framework enables multi-agent coordination through intention-based communication and reasoning. Agents maintain private intentions representing their goals and sub-tasks, which are periodically broadcast to teammates. A propagation network transforms these intentions into customized communication messages for each teammate, facilitating targeted coordination. The framework incorporates bidirectional feedback between execution agents and planning/grounding modules, allowing for dynamic re-planning based on observed outcomes. This design enables agents to reason about their own intentions while considering teammate intentions, promoting coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL tasks.

## Key Results
- Intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors in multi-agent environments
- Emergent coordinated behaviors observed across tested domains
- Improved performance compared to single-agent baselines and state-of-the-art MARL methods on traffic flow prediction and web-based activities datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from providing agents with a structured mechanism for sharing and reasoning about intentions. By broadcasting private intentions and transforming them into teammate-specific messages, agents achieve common grounding without explicit task decomposition. The bidirectional feedback loops enable dynamic adjustment of plans based on execution outcomes, allowing the system to adapt to changing circumstances. This combination of intention sharing, customized communication, and adaptive planning creates a foundation for emergent coordination that addresses the core challenge of miscoordination in multi-agent systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Intention-based communication**: Agents share private goals and sub-tasks to establish common understanding - needed for reducing miscoordination, quick check: verify intention clarity and relevance
- **Propagation network**: Transforms intentions into teammate-specific messages - needed for targeted coordination, quick check: assess message relevance and impact
- **Bidirectional feedback loops**: Connect execution outcomes with planning decisions - needed for dynamic adaptation, quick check: measure re-planning effectiveness
- **Common grounding**: Shared understanding of goals and intentions across agents - needed for coordinated behavior, quick check: evaluate alignment of agent actions
- **Dynamic re-planning**: Ability to adjust plans based on observed outcomes - needed for robust coordination, quick check: test responsiveness to environmental changes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Agents -> Intention Module -> Propagation Network -> Communication Module -> Execution Module -> Feedback Loop -> Planning Module

**Critical Path:**
Intention generation → Intention broadcast → Propagation network transformation → Communication → Execution → Feedback reception → Planning adjustment

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Periodic vs continuous intention broadcasting (communication overhead vs coordination quality)
- Generic vs teammate-specific messages (message complexity vs relevance)
- Static vs dynamic propagation network parameters (adaptability vs stability)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Misaligned intentions leading to conflicting actions
- Propagation network generating irrelevant or misleading messages
- Feedback loops creating oscillation or instability in planning
- Communication delays causing outdated intention propagation

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison without intention propagation in simple coordination tasks
2. Ablation study removing the propagation network to test direct intention sharing
3. Evaluation of communication overhead by varying broadcast frequency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to constrained environments (traffic flow and web-based activities)
- Scalability concerns for larger agent populations and longer time horizons
- Communication overhead of periodic intention broadcasting not explicitly quantified
- Lack of detailed ablation studies on bidirectional feedback mechanism contributions

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical soundness of intention propagation concept
- Medium confidence in performance improvements due to limited evaluation scope
- Low confidence in emergent behavior claims without systematic coordination pattern analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability experiments with increasing numbers of agents and longer task horizons to assess computational overhead and coordination effectiveness
2. Perform detailed ablation studies isolating the contributions of intention propagation, propagation network transformations, and bidirectional feedback mechanisms
3. Evaluate the framework in more complex, high-dimensional environments (e.g., multi-agent robotics or real-time strategy games) to test generalizability and robustness
