- Argues that combining LLMs with structured event representations improves reasoning performance across three schema types

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates how structured representations of events can enhance reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The research focuses on three distinct types of structured representations: language-based event-relation schemas, semi-symbolic event-entity schemas, and fully-symbolic world models. Through systematic experimentation across diverse reasoning tasks, the work demonstrates that incorporating these structured representations leads to improved performance in event reasoning. The thesis argues for the semi-symbolic nature of event reasoning, requiring a balance between language modeling and symbolic reasoning approaches.

## Method Summary
The thesis explores three distinct approaches to structured event reasoning with LLMs. First, it develops a language-based event-relation schema that leverages natural language to represent event relationships. Second, it proposes a semi-symbolic event-entity schema that combines symbolic representations with language-based elements. Third, it examines fully-symbolic world models that provide complete formal representations of events. The research evaluates these approaches across multiple downstream tasks, testing various methodologies including end-to-end approaches, structured reasoning pipelines, and neurosymbolic methods. The experiments use both synthetic data and controlled conditions to assess performance improvements from structured representations.

## Key Results
- LLMs with structured event representations show improved performance across multiple reasoning tasks
- The semi-symbolic approach provides a balance between language modeling and symbolic reasoning
- Neurosymbolic methods demonstrate potential but face challenges in generating syntactically correct structured representations, particularly in low-resource domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The thesis demonstrates that structured event representations provide explicit semantic and syntactic constraints that guide LLM reasoning. By encoding domain knowledge into formal structures, these representations help LLMs overcome limitations in handling complex event relationships and temporal reasoning. The semi-symbolic approach particularly benefits from combining the flexibility of language models with the precision of symbolic representations, allowing for more robust handling of real-world event scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Event-relation schemas: Formal representations of how events relate to each other in time and causality. Why needed: Provides temporal and causal structure for reasoning. Quick check: Can model correctly sequence events in a story.
- Semi-symbolic representations: Hybrid approach combining symbolic precision with language flexibility. Why needed: Balances formal constraints with natural language understanding. Quick check: Can handle ambiguous or incomplete event descriptions.
- World models: Complete formal representations of event structures and relationships. Why needed: Enables precise logical reasoning about events. Quick check: Can answer complex counterfactual questions about events.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Event Data -> Structured Representation Generator -> LLM Reasoning Module -> Output Reasoning

### Critical Path
1. Event data ingestion and preprocessing
2. Structured representation generation (schema-dependent)
3. LLM processing with structured context
4. Reasoning output generation and validation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Language-based vs symbolic representations: Flexibility vs precision
- End-to-end vs pipeline approaches: Simplicity vs control
- Resource requirements vs performance gains

### Failure Signatures
- Incorrect structured representation generation
- LLM misinterpretation of structured context
- Inconsistency between generated and expected outputs
- Performance degradation in low-resource domains

### First Experiments
1. Test structured representation generation on simple event sequences
2. Evaluate LLM reasoning with basic event-relation schemas
3. Compare performance across the three schema types on controlled datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the "hierarchical organizer" mentioned in the conclusion be effectively implemented to dynamically select the appropriate methodology (end-to-end, structured, neurosymbolic) for different reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion mentions the need for a "hierarchical organizer" to reduce hard-coding in pipeline design and dynamically choose methodologies.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses various methodologies for event reasoning but does not provide a concrete framework for selecting the most suitable approach for a given task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of a hierarchical organizer system that can analyze task characteristics and automatically select the optimal methodology, demonstrating improved performance and flexibility across a diverse set of event reasoning tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can the semi-symbolic nature of event reasoning be formalized and generalized beyond the specific tasks explored in this thesis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The thesis argues that event reasoning is semi-symbolic in nature, requiring a balance between language modeling and symbol modeling.
- Why unresolved: While the thesis provides evidence for the semi-symbolic nature of event reasoning, it does not establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing and formalizing this property across a broader range of tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic analysis of various reasoning tasks to identify common patterns and characteristics that define their semi-symbolic nature, leading to a generalizable framework for approaching such tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the performance of neurosymbolic methods be further improved, particularly in generating syntactically and semantically correct structured representations in low-resource domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The thesis highlights the challenges of generating low-resource domain-specific languages (e.g., PDDL) and maintaining consistency in iterative generation using LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the potential of neurosymbolic methods but also reveals limitations in generating correct structured representations, especially in complex or low-resource scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of novel techniques to improve the accuracy and consistency of LLM-generated structured representations, such as incorporating external knowledge sources, refining prompt engineering strategies, or exploring alternative model architectures.

## Limitations
- Primarily evaluated on synthetic data and controlled experiments
- Limited testing in real-world scenarios with ambiguous or conflicting event structures
- Does not extensively address computational efficiency and scalability concerns

## Confidence
- Major claims about improved performance: Medium
- Specific claim about structured representations enhancing LLM reasoning: High

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive real-world testing across multiple domains, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or conflicting event structures
2. Evaluate model performance under adversarial conditions and with noisy or incomplete event data
3. Perform long-term studies to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of these approaches when deployed in production environments
