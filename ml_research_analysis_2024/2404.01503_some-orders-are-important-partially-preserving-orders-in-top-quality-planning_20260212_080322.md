# Some Orders Are Important: Partially Preserving Orders in Top-Quality Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.01503
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01503
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Introduces partially ordered top-quality planning, achieving up to 19 additional tasks solved compared to unordered approach

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the partially ordered top-quality planning problem, which interpolates between traditional top-quality planning and unordered top-quality planning by allowing specification of a subset of actions whose order is important. The authors propose two approaches to solve this problem: extending reduced successor functions from partial order reduction and modifying generalized strong stubborn sets definitions. Experimental results on 1,555 tasks from IPC benchmarks show that both approaches significantly improve coverage compared to a baseline method.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses the problem of finding top-quality plans while partially preserving certain action orderings. Three approaches are compared: NoPOR (post-processing top-quality plans), POR+ (extending reduced successor functions from partial order reduction), and PO-GSSS (modifying generalized strong stubborn sets definitions). The methods are evaluated on 1,555 tasks from IPC benchmarks using regular expressions to identify order-important actions per domain. Experiments use a 30-minute timeout and 3.5GB memory limit, measuring coverage and anytime performance.

## Key Results
- Both POR+ and PO-GSSS approaches achieve up to 19 additional tasks solved compared to NoPOR baseline
- Plan generation ranges from 8 to 4 million depending on domain and order importance specification
- Coverage improvements vary by domain, with some domains showing dramatic improvements while others show modest gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by reducing the search space through partial order reduction techniques. By identifying and preserving only the critical action orderings while allowing flexibility elsewhere, the search can explore more plan variations without being constrained by unnecessary orderings. The POR+ and PO-GSSS methods extend classical partial order reduction techniques to handle the top-quality planning objective, allowing the planner to find optimal or near-optimal plans while respecting specified orderings.

## Foundational Learning
- Partial Order Reduction: Technique to reduce state space by recognizing that some action orderings are irrelevant; needed for efficient planning in large spaces
- Strong Stubborn Sets: A pruning technique in planning that restricts search to relevant actions; quick check: verify it maintains completeness for optimal planning
- Top-Quality Planning: Finding optimal or near-optimal plans; quick check: ensure heuristic guides search toward better quality plans
- Generalized Strong Stubborn Sets: Extension of strong stubborn sets for broader applicability; quick check: verify it handles both optimal and satisficing planning
- Plan Quality Metrics: Methods to evaluate and compare plan quality; quick check: ensure consistent quality measurement across approaches
- Heuristic Search: Using heuristics to guide search in planning; quick check: verify heuristic admissibility for optimal planning

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Planner -> Heuristic Evaluation -> Partial Order Reduction -> Plan Generation -> Quality Assessment

### Critical Path
1. Domain parsing and order-important action identification
2. Heuristic initialization (LM-cut)
3. Search with partial order constraints
4. Plan quality evaluation
5. Plan extraction and verification

### Design Tradeoffs
The key tradeoff is between preserving necessary orderings for correctness versus allowing flexibility for quality optimization. The approach must balance computational efficiency with the ability to find high-quality plans. The choice between POR+ and PO-GSSS involves tradeoffs between implementation complexity and performance characteristics.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor coverage indicates incorrect identification of order-important actions
- Memory exhaustion suggests insufficient pruning of the search space
- Suboptimal plan quality may indicate overly aggressive pruning
- Long solution times could indicate insufficient guidance from the heuristic

### 3 First Experiments
1. Verify correct identification of order-important actions using provided regular expressions on sample domains
2. Run NoPOR baseline on a small set of tasks to establish performance baseline
3. Compare POR+ and PO-GSSS on domains with known order constraints to validate implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Regular expressions for identifying order-important actions may not capture all relevant constraints
- Performance varies significantly across domains, with some showing minimal improvement
- Memory limitations may restrict applicability to larger planning problems
- The approaches require careful tuning of parameters for optimal performance

## Confidence
- Coverage claims (up to 19 additional tasks): Medium
- Performance metrics (plan generation counts, solution times): Low
- Experimental methodology: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Verify the regular expressions against domain files to ensure correct identification of order-important actions
2. Run the three approaches on a subset of IPC benchmarks with the specified timeout and memory limits
3. Compare the generated plan counts and solution times against the paper's reported ranges to assess the accuracy of the performance claims
