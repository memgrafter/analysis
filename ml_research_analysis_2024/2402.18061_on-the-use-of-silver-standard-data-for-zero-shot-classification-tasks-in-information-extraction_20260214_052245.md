# On the use of Silver Standard Data for Zero-shot Classification Tasks in Information Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.18061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18061
- Reference count: 0
- Zero-shot relation classification: 5-6% improvement over baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Clean-LaVe, a framework that improves zero-shot classification tasks in information extraction by leveraging silver standard data—pseudo-labeled data generated by off-the-shelf NLP models. Clean-LaVe filters noisy pseudo-labels using an iteratively weighted negative learning algorithm and a class-aware data selector before fine-tuning the model. Experiments demonstrate significant performance gains across multiple datasets and tasks, including relation classification, cross-lingual relation classification, and event argument classification.

## Method Summary
Clean-LaVe is a four-phase framework for zero-shot classification: (1) generate silver standard data using LaVeEntail, (2) filter noisy data using iteratively weighted negative learning (IWNL) and class-aware data selection (CADS), (3) fine-tune the off-the-shelf model using the cleaned data, and (4) perform inference on test data. The IWNL component dynamically adjusts class weights to handle imbalance, while CADS ensures diverse class coverage during filtering. The framework is designed to be general and applicable to scenarios where pre-trained models serve as annotators.

## Key Results
- 5-6% improvement over baseline on TACRED and Wiki80 datasets in zero-shot relation classification
- 3-7% improvement on Smile datasets (Korean and Polish) in zero-shot cross-lingual relation classification
- 8% improvement on ACE05-E+ in zero-shot event argument classification
- Ablation studies show both IWNL and CADS components are essential for performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Silver standard data generated by off-the-shelf models can be leveraged to improve zero-shot classification performance when combined with targeted noise reduction.
- Mechanism: Clean-LaVe uses the original model's predictions as pseudo-labels, then filters out noisy labels via an iteratively weighted negative learning algorithm and class-aware data selector, producing cleaner training data for finetuning.
- Core assumption: Not all pseudo-labels are equally noisy; some carry useful signal that can be extracted with proper weighting and class balance handling.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "A potentially valuable by-product of these methods is the large-scale silver standard data, i.e., pseudo-labeled data by the off-the-shelf models of other NLP tasks."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iteratively weighted negative learning (IWNL) reduces the impact of class imbalance on noisy-label detection.
- Mechanism: IWNL dynamically adjusts class weights during training so minority classes get higher weight, improving detection accuracy for clean samples in underrepresented classes.
- Core assumption: Class imbalance is a key source of underfitting in minority classes, making it harder to distinguish clean from noisy samples there.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "We propose a iteratively weighted NL loss to alleviate this issue, giving more weight on minority classes."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Class-aware data selection improves class coverage during filtering, preventing over-selection from high-confidence majority classes.
- Mechanism: After initial confidence-based filtering, the selector samples additional examples from each class proportionally, ensuring minority classes aren't dropped entirely.
- Core assumption: High confidence alone is insufficient; diversity in selected classes is needed for robust finetuning.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "The class-aware data selector that enables the selection of data from a broader range of classes."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Negative learning / complementary labels
  - Why needed here: The framework uses negative learning to mitigate overfitting to noisy pseudo-labels, which is central to the filtering stage.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why training with complementary labels might reduce the risk of fitting to incorrect pseudo-labels?

- Concept: Imbalanced learning and dynamic weighting
  - Why needed here: The IWNL algorithm requires understanding how to adjust class weights dynamically to counter underfitting in minority classes.
  - Quick check question: How does underfitting in minority classes manifest in terms of loss, and how does increasing weight help?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning and teacher-student models
  - Why needed here: Clean-LaVe effectively treats the off-the-shelf model as a teacher and the finetuned model as a student, filtering and transferring knowledge.
  - Quick check question: In what ways does the silver data filtering step resemble a teacher-student knowledge distillation pipeline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Label verbalization -> Off-the-shelf model inference -> Iteratively weighted negative learning -> Class-aware data selector -> TE model finetuning -> Test inference

- Critical path: 1. Generate silver data via LaVeEntail 2. Filter with IWNL + CADS → Dclean 3. Convert Dclean to premise-hypothesis pairs 4. Finetune TE model 5. Predict on test set

- Design tradeoffs: More aggressive filtering (lower η) → cleaner but smaller Dclean, risk underfitting; Higher η → more data but more noise; Larger m → better class balance but higher risk of including noisy minority samples

- Failure signatures: Performance drops when CADS is removed on imbalanced datasets; Gains disappear when IWNL is removed on skewed class distributions; No improvement over LaVeEntail when using balanced datasets

- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare Clean-LaVe vs. Silver-LaVe on TACRED to validate filtering necessity 2. Vary η and m on ACE05-E+ to find sweet spot for class-aware selection 3. Run with and without IWNL on Wiki80 to confirm benefit on balanced data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of Clean-LaVe compare to traditional noisy label learning methods when using pre-trained models other than BERT for the relation classifier?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses BERT as the relation classifier with IWNL loss but notes that its performance falls short of the BERT-based classifier when using a TE model trained with IWNL loss.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between Clean-LaVe with BERT and Clean-LaVe with other pre-trained models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing Clean-LaVe using different pre-trained models for the relation classifier.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different textual entailment models (other than microsoft/deberta-v2-xlarge-mnil and mDeBERTa-v3-base-xnli-multilingual-nli-2mil7) on the performance of Clean-LaVe?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses specific TE models for RE and EAC tasks and cross-lingual RE task, but does not explore the performance impact of using different TE models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparison of Clean-LaVe's performance with different TE models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing Clean-LaVe using different TE models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Clean-LaVe perform when applied to zero-shot classification tasks outside of information extraction, such as sentiment analysis or topic classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates Clean-LaVe's effectiveness in zero-shot RE, cross-lingual RE, and EAC tasks, but does not explore its applicability to other zero-shot classification tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on IE tasks and does not provide evidence of Clean-LaVe's performance in other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying Clean-LaVe to zero-shot classification tasks in other domains.

## Limitations
- Limited experimental validation of the clean data detection module's performance
- Lack of comprehensive analysis of silver data quality impact on final performance
- Scalability to larger datasets or more complex tasks remains untested

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The conceptual framework of using silver standard data for zero-shot classification is sound and aligns with established semi-supervised learning principles.
- Medium Confidence: The specific implementation details, such as the iteratively weighted negative learning algorithm and class-aware data selector, are plausible but lack sufficient empirical validation in the paper.
- Low Confidence: The scalability and robustness of the framework across diverse datasets and noise conditions are not adequately demonstrated, limiting confidence in its generalizability.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study to isolate the contributions of each component (IWNL, CADS) and compare their performance against alternative methods.
2. Evaluate the framework on larger datasets or more complex tasks to assess its scalability and robustness.
3. Perform a detailed analysis of how varying levels of noise in the silver data affect the final performance, including visualizations of confidence score distributions and class-wise performance metrics.
