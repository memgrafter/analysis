core_contribution: This position paper argues that the widespread use of general-purpose
  programming languages for defining reinforcement learning (RL) environments creates
  barriers to both usability and generalisation. The authors propose a research agenda

# A Research Agenda for Usability and Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16970
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16970
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes research agenda for enabling RL environment descriptions in user-friendly DSLs or natural language to improve usability and generalization

## Executive Summary
This position paper argues that the widespread use of general-purpose programming languages for defining reinforcement learning (RL) environments creates barriers to both usability and generalization. The authors propose a research agenda focused on enabling environment descriptions in user-friendly domain-specific languages (DSLs) or natural language, which would allow non-experts to describe their problems and enable agents to leverage these descriptions for better generalization. They identify key desiderata for such languages including user-friendliness, completeness, generality, computational efficiency, and facilitation of procedural generation.

## Method Summary
This is a position paper proposing a research agenda rather than presenting experimental results. The authors synthesize existing work on DSLs for games, natural language processing, and RL generalization to argue for a new direction in environment specification. They identify desiderata for environment description languages and discuss how such languages could enable zero-shot generalization by providing agents with complete context about task structure.

## Key Results
- DSL-based environment descriptions can reduce engineering barriers by separating environment specification from implementation
- Environment descriptions serve as context that enables zero-shot generalization across describable environments
- DSLs enable procedural generation of environments, filling gaps in the space of describable problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DSL-based environment descriptions reduce engineering barriers by separating environment specification from implementation
- Mechanism: Users describe environments in high-level DSLs rather than implementing simulators in general-purpose programming languages, eliminating the need for programming expertise in RL deployment
- Core assumption: DSLs can be designed that are both expressive enough to describe relevant environments and simple enough for non-experts to use
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "users with little to no engineering expertise can formally describe the problems they would like to be tackled"
  - [section 3.2]: "users with little to no programming experience may—depending on the complexity and user-friendliness of the DSL in question—use it to describe new environments"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers focus on technical aspects rather than user accessibility
- Break condition: If DSLs become too complex to be user-friendly or fail to capture necessary environment complexity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Environment descriptions serve as context that enables zero-shot generalization across describable environments
- Mechanism: Complete environment descriptions provide agents with sufficient information about task structure, allowing them to generalize without additional training
- Core assumption: Environment descriptions contain enough information to distinguish between different environments and inform policy selection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "algorithms can leverage problem descriptions to effectively generalise among all problems describable in the language of choice"
  - [section 4.3]: "contexts that completely describe an environment—to the extent that they could be translated into executable simulators—are likely to be a prerequisite for unrestricted, zero-shot generalisation"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - most related work focuses on technical RL improvements rather than generalization through context
- Break condition: If descriptions lack sufficient detail to disambiguate between environments or if agents cannot effectively process the contextual information

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DSLs enable procedural generation of environments, filling gaps in the space of describable problems
- Mechanism: Languages designed for procedural content generation allow automated creation of new environment descriptions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the problem space
- Core assumption: DSLs can be structured to support automated generation of valid, diverse environment descriptions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6]: "descriptions can ideally be compiled into computationally efficient simulators" and "Facilitation of procedural generation"
  - [section 3.4]: "It could be argued that contexts that completely describe an environment...are likely to be a prerequisite for unrestricted, zero-shot generalisation"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers focus on technical aspects rather than procedural generation capabilities
- Break condition: If procedural generation produces invalid descriptions or fails to create diverse enough environments for effective learning

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: These formalisms provide the mathematical foundation for understanding how environments are represented and how agents interact with them
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between MDPs and POMDPs in terms of agent observability?

- Concept: Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and their design principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding DSL design is crucial for creating user-friendly environment description languages that balance expressiveness with accessibility
  - Quick check question: What are the primary design tradeoffs when creating DSLs for non-expert users?

- Concept: Generalization and transfer learning in reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument relies on using environment descriptions as context to enable better generalization across tasks
  - Quick check question: How does providing complete environment descriptions as context differ from traditional multi-task RL approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  User Interface -> Language Processing -> Simulation Engine -> Agent Interface -> Generalization Module

- Critical path:
  1. User provides environment description
  2. Description is validated and compiled into simulator
  3. Simulator is instantiated and connected to agent interface
  4. Agent interacts with environment using standard API
  5. Agent uses description as additional context for decision-making

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. user-friendliness in DSL design
  - Completeness of descriptions vs. ease of creation
  - Simulation speed vs. description language complexity
  - Generalization capability vs. computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Invalid or ambiguous environment descriptions causing compilation failures
  - Agents failing to generalize despite having complete descriptions
  - Simulation performance degradation with complex descriptions
  - User confusion or difficulty in creating valid descriptions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple DSL for a restricted domain (e.g., grid-world games) and test user creation of valid environments
  2. Build a compiler from DSL to executable simulator and measure simulation speed and correctness
  3. Train agents on environments from the DSL with and without using descriptions as context, measuring generalization performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can environment descriptions in user-friendly DSLs or natural language be made complete and unambiguous enough to enable zero-shot generalization across all problems describable in the language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors argue that succinct but complete environment descriptions could enable zero-shot generalization, and note that ambiguities and underspecification in natural language present substantial challenges.
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs struggle with reliability and correctness, and existing DSLs vary in their ability to support automated inference of complete action spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a DSL or LLM pipeline that can consistently translate complete, unambiguous environment descriptions into executable simulators that support zero-shot transfer learning.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between user-friendliness and generality in DSLs for describing reinforcement learning environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that highly expressive languages may be difficult for humans to use, while more user-friendly DSLs may lack generality.
- Why unresolved: Different DSLs prioritize different aspects, and there is limited quantitative evaluation of how ease of use relates to expressiveness and automation capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing multiple DSLs across metrics of user-friendliness, expressiveness, and automated inference capabilities, with human subjects describing novel environments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can procedural generation techniques effectively fill uncovered regions in the space of problems describable in a given DSL to improve zero-shot generalization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that procedural generation could help fill uncovered areas in the space of describable problems, but note that the design of the language impacts how easy it is for evolutionary algorithms to navigate and construct suitable novel elements.
- Why unresolved: While procedural generation is used in other domains, its effectiveness for generating complete, valid environment descriptions in DSLs is unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of procedural generation methods on DSLs, measuring coverage of the problem space and impact on generalization performance.

## Limitations

- The paper presents a conceptual research agenda without empirical validation of proposed mechanisms
- User-friendliness of DSLs for non-experts remains unproven without actual testing with target users
- The assumption that environment descriptions can reliably enable zero-shot generalization lacks experimental support

## Confidence

- **Low**: Claims about user-friendliness of DSLs for non-experts - no empirical testing with target users
- **Medium**: Claims about DSLs enabling procedural generation - supported by existing work but unproven for RL environments
- **Medium**: Claims about environment descriptions enabling generalization - conceptually sound but lacks experimental validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies with non-experts attempting to create valid environment descriptions using a prototype DSL, measuring success rates and time-to-completion
2. Implement a prototype DSL-to-simulator compiler and benchmark the computational efficiency of generated environments compared to hand-coded implementations
3. Design and run controlled experiments testing whether agents trained on descriptions-as-context show improved generalization compared to agents without such context, using standardized RL benchmarks
