# Event-Triggered Reinforcement Learning Based Joint Resource Allocation for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency V2X Communications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13947
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13947
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 95% of joint optimization performance while reducing DRL executions by up to 24% through event-triggered learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for safety-critical information in 6G-enabled vehicular networks. The authors propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for joint power and block length allocation that minimizes worst-case decoding-error probability in the finite block length regime. The approach combines optimization theory with event-triggered DRL to achieve near-optimal reliability while significantly reducing computational overhead. The two-layered DRL architecture separates discrete block length optimization from continuous power allocation, improving learning efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method involves two main components: (1) a joint optimization algorithm (JOA) based on optimization theory that solves a relaxed convex version of the problem and converts the continuous solution to integer block lengths using greedy search, and (2) an event-triggered DRL approach that uses a two-layered architecture with multiple DQNs for block length optimization and a DDPG-based actor-critic network for power allocation. The event-trigger mechanism compares current and previous states, reusing previous actions when changes are below a threshold to reduce DRL executions. The framework operates in an offline training and online execution mode, with experience replay and target networks for stability.

## Key Results
- Event-triggered DRL achieves 95% of joint optimization performance while reducing DRL executions by up to 24%
- Two-layered DRL architecture effectively handles hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces
- Proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes like SWIPT-based and pure DRL approaches in terms of reliability
- Event-trigger mechanism maintains reliability performance while significantly reducing computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Joint convexity of decoding error probability with respect to block length and transmit power within the region of interest enables tractable optimization.
- Mechanism: The paper demonstrates that under the assumption of high SNR (γk ≥ 0 dB) and when the Shannon rate exceeds the coding rate, the decoding error probability function is jointly convex in the auxiliary variables ak = 1/mk and bk = √Pk. This convexity allows the application of KKT conditions and Lagrangian dual decomposition to find optimal solutions.
- Core assumption: The decoding error probability remains jointly convex only when the block length satisfies mk ≤ min{5 ln(2)γk(bk)L, 3 ln(2)10√10γk(bk)L/4}, ensuring the Shannon rate exceeds the coding rate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Initially, an algorithm grounded in optimization theory is developed based on deriving the joint convexity of the decoding error probability in the block length and transmit power variables within the region of interest."
  - [section] "Lemma 1. Under the assumption that γk(bk)≥γth = 0 dB and the Shannon rate exceeds the coding rate, i.e., Ck(γk(bk))−akL > 0, the OPBP is a convex optimization problem when mk satisfies..."
- Break condition: If the SNR drops below the threshold or block lengths exceed the derived bounds, the convexity property breaks down, potentially invalidating the optimization approach.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Event-triggered learning reduces computational overhead while maintaining reliability performance by activating DRL only when state changes exceed a threshold.
- Mechanism: The paper introduces an event-trigger block that compares the current state with the previous state. If the absolute difference is below the trigger threshold υ, the previous action is reused without initiating the DRL process. This leverages temporal correlation in channel states to reduce unnecessary DRL executions.
- Core assumption: Channel states in consecutive time frames exhibit temporal correlation, making resource allocation decisions likely to be similar when state changes are small.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Incorporating event-triggered learning into the DRL framework enables assessing whether to initiate the DRL process, thereby reducing the number of DRL process executions while maintaining reasonable reliability performance."
  - [section] "According to (1), for low Doppler frequency, the input states of the training agent, which includes the channel gains in consecutive time frames, are very similar due to the temporal correlation between the current and past channel conditions."
- Break condition: In high mobility scenarios with rapid channel fluctuations, the temporal correlation assumption weakens, potentially requiring more frequent DRL executions and reducing the benefit of event-triggered learning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Two-layered DRL architecture separates discrete block length optimization from continuous power allocation, improving learning efficiency and performance.
- Mechanism: The framework uses multiple DQNs in the first layer for discrete block length assignment (reducing action space from (MD)K to KxMD) and a DDPG-based actor-critic network in the second layer for continuous power allocation. This separation addresses the hybrid discrete-continuous nature of the problem.
- Core assumption: The separation of concerns between block length and power allocation allows each network to specialize in its respective domain without interference from the other's action space complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The DRL framework consists of a two-layered structure. In the first layer, multiple deep Q-networks (DQNs) are established at the central trainer for block length optimization. The second layer involves an actor-critic network and utilizes the deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm to optimize the power allocation."
  - [section] "The MMDEP problem inherently constitutes a hybrid discrete-continuous action space. The two-layered network structure at the RSU optimizes the discrete block length allocation policy and the continuous transmit power allocation policy simultaneously..."
- Break condition: If the coupling between block length and power allocation decisions is stronger than anticipated, the separation might miss optimal joint solutions that require simultaneous consideration.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Finite block length (FBL) information theory and its distinction from Shannon capacity
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly moves beyond Shannon capacity to incorporate FBL regime, which is crucial for URLLC where short packets are transmitted and decoding error probability cannot be neglected.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the achievable rate formula in FBL regime versus the Shannon capacity formula, and why does this matter for URLLC?

- Concept: Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) and relaxation techniques
  - Why needed here: The problem formulation involves both continuous (power) and integer (block length) variables with non-convex constraints, requiring relaxation of integer constraints and variable transformation to make the problem tractable.
  - Quick check question: Why does relaxing the integer constraint on block length help in solving the optimization problem, and what post-processing step is needed to obtain integer solutions?

- Concept: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with hybrid action spaces
  - Why needed here: The resource allocation problem involves both discrete (block length) and continuous (power) decisions, requiring specialized DRL architectures that can handle this hybrid nature effectively.
  - Quick check question: How does the two-layered DRL architecture (multiple DQNs + DDPG) address the challenge of optimizing in hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RSU -> Event Trigger -> DRL (DQN layer + DDPG layer) -> Action Selection -> Environment -> Reward Calculation -> Experience Storage -> Network Update
- Critical path: State observation → Event trigger check → DRL execution (if triggered) → Action selection → Environment step → Reward calculation → Experience storage → Network update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Event threshold vs. performance: Higher thresholds reduce DRL executions but may degrade reliability
  - Network complexity vs. convergence: Two-layered approach adds complexity but improves specialization
  - Training time vs. runtime efficiency: Offline training enables fast online decisions but requires upfront computational investment
- Failure signatures:
  - High constraint violations indicate poor constraint handling in reward function
  - Slow convergence suggests inappropriate learning rates or exploration strategy
  - Large gap between JOA and DRL performance indicates insufficient training or architectural limitations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test event trigger threshold sensitivity: Vary υ from 0.1 to 0.9 and measure reliability vs. DRL execution reduction
  2. Compare single-DQN vs. two-layered approach: Implement both and measure convergence time and final performance
  3. Validate convexity bounds: Test JOA performance as block lengths approach theoretical convexity limits to identify breakdown points

## Limitations

- Convexity region validity is limited to specific SNR and block length bounds, potentially invalidating the optimization approach in real-world scenarios
- Event-trigger threshold selection is arbitrary (set to 0.5) without systematic justification or sensitivity analysis
- Simulation scope is limited to a specific highway scenario with 3 lanes and 4 vehicles, limiting generalizability to denser networks or different topologies

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem and the two-layered DRL architecture are well-defined and implementable. The core mechanism of event-triggered learning for reducing computational overhead is sound.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that the event-triggered DRL achieves 95% of the joint optimization performance while reducing executions by 24% is based on simulations but may not generalize across different network conditions. The effectiveness of the convexity-based optimization depends on the validity of the SNR and block length bounds.

**Low confidence**: The performance in high mobility scenarios is uncertain, as the temporal correlation assumption underlying event-triggered learning may break down. The impact of imperfect channel state information or mobility-induced estimation errors is not evaluated.

## Next Checks

1. **Convexity region validation**: Systematically test the JOA performance as SNR decreases below 0 dB and block lengths approach the theoretical bounds. Identify the exact points where the convexity property breaks down and measure the resulting performance degradation.

2. **Event-trigger threshold sensitivity**: Conduct a comprehensive sweep of event-trigger thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 and measure the reliability-performance tradeoff across different mobility levels (Doppler frequencies). Identify optimal thresholds for different operating conditions.

3. **Scalability testing**: Evaluate the proposed framework in dense vehicular networks (10+ vehicles) with varying topologies (urban intersections, multi-lane highways). Measure performance degradation and identify limitations in scalability and interference handling.
