# Can Language Models Learn to Skip Steps?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01855
- Authors: Tengxiao Liu; Qipeng Guo; Xiangkun Hu; Cheng Jiayang; Yue Zhang; Xipeng Qiu; Zheng Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Models can skip reasoning steps without sacrificing accuracy and gain enhanced OOD generalization through iterative refinement on mixed full-skipped data

## Executive Summary
This work explores whether language models can learn to skip reasoning steps like humans do to improve efficiency. Unlike humans, models lack intrinsic motivation to minimize reasoning steps, so the authors introduce a controlled framework that stimulates step-skipping behavior through iterative refinement. The approach involves training models on complete stepwise reasoning data, prompting them to generate shorter answers, filtering correct skipped-step responses, and retraining on mixed datasets containing both full and skipped reasoning paths.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two phases: initialization and iterative refinement. During initialization, models are trained on full-step reasoning data (cold start) or with added manually created skipped-step examples (warm start). In the iterative phase, models are prompted to produce shorter answers within step limits, correct skipped-step outputs are filtered, and these are mixed with original full-step data to create expanded training sets. Models are then retrained on this mixed data, and the process repeats. The final model is fine-tuned on the mixed dataset without step constraints, aiming to balance efficiency and accuracy while improving out-of-domain generalization.

## Key Results
- Models successfully skipped steps across three tasks (Analog of Algebra, Multi-digit Addition, Directional Reasoning) without accuracy loss
- Enhanced out-of-domain generalization observed when training on mixed full-skipped reasoning data
- Warm start initialization with manually created skipped data improved skipping proficiency on complex tasks where cold start alone failed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Controlled step-skipping emerges through iterative refinement exposing models to both complete and self-generated skipped reasoning paths
- Core assumption: Models can learn valid skipping patterns through exposure to their own successful skipped outputs
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states framework "stimulates step-skipping behavior by iteratively refining models to generate shorter and accurate reasoning paths"
- Break condition: Iterative cycle stalls if models fail to generate correct skipped-step answers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Step-skipping improves OOD generalization by training on mixed easy (skipped) and hard (full) reasoning data
- Core assumption: Mixed data provides broader pattern exposure preventing overfitting to full-step patterns
- Evidence anchors: Abstract notes models "exhibit comparable and even enhanced generalization capabilities in out-of-domain scenarios"
- Break condition: OOD performance degrades if skipped data introduces systematic bias

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Warm start with human-crafted skipped data improves skipping proficiency when cold start fails
- Core assumption: Human-annotated skipped steps provide valid shortcuts models can learn from
- Evidence anchors: Section shows warm start "enhances the models' proficiency with step skipping"
- Break condition: Human-crafted data introduces biases leading to incorrect shortcuts

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Iterative refinement through self-generated data
  - Why needed here: Models lack intrinsic motivation to skip steps, requiring iterative cycles of prompting, filtering, and retraining
  - Quick check question: What happens if no correct skipped-step outputs are generated during an iteration?

- Concept: Easy-to-hard generalization via mixed data exposure
  - Why needed here: Training only on full-step reasoning leads to overfitting; mixing skipped and full steps provides broader pattern exposure
  - Quick check question: How does including skipped-step data prevent shortcut bias while improving generalization?

- Concept: Warm vs. cold start trade-offs
  - Why needed here: Cold start preserves model autonomy but may fail on complex tasks; warm start injects human insight to bootstrap skipping ability
  - Quick check question: Why might warm start introduce human bias, and how does the iteration phase mitigate it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base model -> Data preparation (full/skipped) -> Iterative training loop (prompt->filter->mix->retrain) -> Evaluation harness
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize model with full-step data (cold or warm start)
  2. Run inference with step-limit prompt to generate skipped-step answers
  3. Filter correct skipped-step outputs
  4. Mix filtered data with original full-step data
  5. Retrain model on mixed data
  6. Repeat iterations until convergence or target performance
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Cold start preserves autonomy but may fail on complex tasks
  - Warm start improves skipping success but risks injecting human bias
  - Iteration count vs. performance: more iterations can improve OOD generalization but risk overfitting
- Failure signatures:
  - No correct skipped-step outputs during iterations → stalled learning
  - OOD performance degrades after iterations → shortcut bias introduced
  - Accuracy drops while step count decreases → model skipping necessary steps
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run cold start on Analog of Algebra, evaluate step-following accuracy and ability to generate skipped-step outputs
  2. Apply warm start to Multi-digit Addition, compare skipping accuracy vs. cold start
  3. Train standard model on mixed data from Iteration 5, evaluate in-domain vs. OOD accuracy and step count reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal stopping point for the iterative training process to balance accuracy and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - paper notes final iteration doesn't consistently yield best performance with significant fluctuations in test results
- Why unresolved: Paper acknowledges importance but provides no clear criterion for termination
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with varying iteration counts analyzing accuracy-efficiency trade-off to identify optimal stopping point

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does step-skipping ability generalize across different domains and tasks?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - cross-domain experiment shows positive effect on withheld task but generalizability not fully explored
- Why unresolved: Initial evidence provided but doesn't comprehensively explore transfer to different reasoning structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on wider variety of tasks with different reasoning structures and complexities

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the underlying mechanisms that allow models to skip steps effectively without losing accuracy?
- Basis in paper: Inferred - paper suggests benefits from mixed training but doesn't investigate specific cognitive processes
- Why unresolved: Provides empirical evidence but doesn't examine internal mechanisms or decision-making processes
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing internal representations and decision-making through attention analysis or probing techniques

## Limitations

- Cold start approach's success depends on models spontaneously developing skipping ability, which may not generalize to more complex reasoning domains
- Warm start introduces human bias through manually crafted skipped data without adequately addressing how this bias affects model behavior
- Termination criteria for iterative refinement remain underspecified, raising concerns about potential overfitting or suboptimal stopping points

## Confidence

- High confidence: Core finding that step-skipping can be achieved through iterative refinement without sacrificing accuracy for the three tasks studied
- Medium confidence: Claim that mixed training data improves OOD generalization due to limited experimental validation and lack of comparison to alternative methods
- Low confidence: Assertion that models can autonomously discover optimal skipping patterns through cold start alone, given warm start was required for some tasks

## Next Checks

1. Test the iterative framework on a more complex reasoning task (e.g., multi-step scientific reasoning) to evaluate whether skipping ability transfers beyond arithmetic and directional tasks

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing cold start vs. warm start across all tasks, measuring not just accuracy but also the quality and interpretability of skipped steps generated

3. Implement a systematic early stopping criterion based on OOD validation performance to determine optimal iteration count and test whether this prevents overfitting while maintaining generalization benefits
