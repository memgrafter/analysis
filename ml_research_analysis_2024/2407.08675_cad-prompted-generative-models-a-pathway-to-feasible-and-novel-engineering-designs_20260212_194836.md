# CAD-Prompted Generative Models: A Pathway to Feasible and Novel Engineering Designs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.08675
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08675
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CAD image prompting significantly improves perceived feasibility of T2I-generated engineering designs while preserving novelty at optimal weights.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a method to improve the design feasibility of text-to-image (T2I) generative models for engineering applications by prompting with CAD images of feasible designs alongside text prompts. Using Stable Diffusion 2.1 and the BIKED dataset of 4800 diverse bike images, the approach employs CLIP to find semantically similar CAD images to text prompts, then uses these as visual prompts during generation. A case study with 15 bike design prompts showed that CAD image prompting significantly improves perceived feasibility of generated designs, with the 0.35 weight setting achieving the best balance between feasibility and novelty. The results demonstrate the potential of this method to expand the applicability of T2I models in engineering design by creating more visibly feasible concepts.

## Method Summary
The method involves using CLIP to identify the most semantically similar CAD image to a given text prompt from a CAD image dataset, then inputting both the text prompt and CAD image into Stable Diffusion 2.1 with varying weights (0.35, 0.51, 0.67, 0.83, 1.0) to generate designs. This approach, called CAD Image Prompting (CIP), is tested against text-only prompts and Prompt Magic-enhanced generation. Human evaluations on feasibility and novelty are collected for 420 generated images across seven different settings to determine the optimal balance between these two criteria.

## Key Results
- CAD image prompting significantly improved perceived feasibility compared to text-only prompts, with the 0.35 weight setting showing the best balance between feasibility and novelty.
- At higher weights (0.67 and above), novelty significantly decreased while feasibility gains plateaued or degraded.
- Human evaluators consistently rated CAD image-prompted designs as more feasible across all tested weight settings compared to text-only generation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CAD image prompting improves feasibility by conditioning generation on semantically similar real CAD designs.
- Mechanism: The CLIP model finds a CAD image whose embedding closely matches the text prompt, then uses this image as a visual prompt in Stable Diffusion. This injects domain knowledge into the generative process, steering outputs toward realizable geometry.
- Core assumption: CLIP similarity between text and CAD image correlates with the feasibility of generated designs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach involves prompting the T2I model with CAD images of feasible designs, alongside text prompts, to guide the generation of more viable concepts."
  - [section] "The CLIP model is utilized to identify the image that is the most semantically similar to the text prompt from the CAD image dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No neighbor studies explicitly validate CLIP→feasibility correlation.
- Break condition: If CLIP similarity is high but the CAD image itself is not actually feasible, the method may mislead generation toward non-viable forms.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Low prompting weights (e.g., 0.35) balance feasibility gains with novelty preservation.
- Mechanism: At lower weights, the T2I model still gives significant influence to the text prompt, allowing creative divergence, while the CAD image subtly biases geometry toward plausible designs.
- Core assumption: Feasibility and novelty are inversely correlated in T2I outputs; small nudges can improve feasibility without collapsing novelty.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When the prompting weight is kept low around 0.35, the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty remains on par with those generated by text prompts alone."
  - [section] "the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty remains on par with those generated by text prompts alone."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No direct study on weight-specific feasibility/novelty balance in engineering domains.
- Break condition: At weights above ~0.67, novelty drops significantly; at 1.0, feasibility also degrades, indicating over-reliance on the CAD image.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CAD images provide a structured, synthetic prompt source more suitable than real-world images for engineering design.
- Mechanism: CAD images encode explicit geometry and constraints, unlike natural images. This makes them more compatible with engineering goals and downstream CAD/3D conversion pipelines.
- Core assumption: Synthetic CAD prompts are more amenable to transformation into manufacturable CAD/3D models than photorealistic prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "CAD image datasets can easily be fabricated using CAD software, giving designers more flexibility and control over the image generation process."
  - [section] "When using real-world images, designers need to communicate their design ideas through text if the ideas do not already exist in the world."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No neighbor studies explicitly compare synthetic CAD vs real-world image prompting efficacy.
- Break condition: If synthetic CAD images are not diverse or representative, the method may overfit to limited design space.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text-to-image generative models and their limitations in engineering design.
  - Why needed here: Understanding why vanilla T2I models fail to produce feasible designs is key to justifying the CAD prompting approach.
  - Quick check question: What specific problem does CAD prompting solve that Prompt Magic does not?

- Concept: CLIP similarity and multimodal prompting in Stable Diffusion.
  - Why needed here: The method depends on matching text prompts to CAD images via CLIP embeddings and blending them in generation.
  - Quick check question: How does the CLIP similarity score between a text prompt and a CAD image influence the final generated design?

- Concept: Feasibility vs novelty tradeoff in generative design.
  - Why needed here: The study identifies a tension between producing feasible and novel designs, which guides parameter selection.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing the CAD image prompting weight reduce novelty, and how is this tradeoff quantified?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text prompt → CLIP → best matching CAD image
  - Text prompt + CAD image → Stable Diffusion 2.1 (with Prompt Magic)
  - Generated images → Human evaluation (feasibility/novelty)
  - Evaluation data → Feedback loop for weight tuning

- Critical path:
  - Text → CLIP match → Image generation → Evaluation
  - Failures in CLIP matching or generation weighting will directly impact output quality.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher CAD weight → better feasibility but lower novelty
  - Lower CAD weight → better novelty but insufficient feasibility gain
  - Real-world images → richer visual context but less engineering relevance
  - CAD images → domain-aligned but may lack visual richness

- Failure signatures:
  - CLIP returns irrelevant CAD image → nonsensical generated design
  - Weight too high (>0.83) → feasibility drops again, likely due to prompt imbalance
  - Weight too low (~0) → no feasibility gain over baseline
  - CAD dataset too narrow → limited design diversity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate designs with SD+PM only, collect baseline feasibility/novelty scores.
  2. Generate with CIP(0.35), compare feasibility/novelty to baseline.
  3. Sweep CAD weight from 0.35 to 1.0 in steps of 0.17, plot feasibility/novelty curves to identify optimal range.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of CAD image prompting vary across different types of engineering products (e.g., chairs, cars, electronics) compared to bikes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on a bike design case study but suggests generalizability to other engineering design domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results for one product type, limiting understanding of broader applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar studies with various engineering products and comparing the effectiveness of CAD image prompting across different domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal CAD image prompting weight for balancing feasibility and novelty across different stages of the engineering design process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses a trade-off between feasibility and novelty and suggests different settings for different design stages.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides general guidelines but doesn't specify optimal weights for each design stage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies testing different CAD image prompting weights at each stage of the design process and measuring their impact on feasibility and novelty.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality and diversity of the CAD image dataset affect the performance of the CAD image prompting method?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using a dataset of CAD images but doesn't explore the impact of dataset quality or diversity.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate how different datasets might influence the effectiveness of the method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of the method using datasets of varying quality and diversity, and analyzing the relationship between dataset characteristics and generation outcomes.

## Limitations

- The CLIP similarity mechanism's reliability in matching text prompts to truly feasible CAD images remains unverified, with no direct validation of the semantic similarity→feasibility correlation.
- The optimal weight of 0.35 for balancing feasibility and novelty is based on a single case study with bike designs, limiting generalizability to other engineering domains.
- The human evaluation methodology lacks details on evaluator expertise and potential biases that could affect the perceived feasibility scores.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic mechanism of using CAD images to prompt T2I models is technically sound and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The observed improvements in feasibility at lower weights (0.35) are supported by the case study data, but may not generalize.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the optimal weight and the generalizability of results across different engineering domains.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain validation: Apply the CAD prompting method to at least two other engineering design tasks (e.g., furniture, tools) to test generalizability.
2. Implement automated feasibility assessment: Develop metrics to objectively measure design feasibility beyond human perception, such as geometric constraints and manufacturing requirements.
3. Analyze CLIP matching quality: Systematically evaluate the relationship between CLIP similarity scores and actual design feasibility to validate the core assumption of the method.
