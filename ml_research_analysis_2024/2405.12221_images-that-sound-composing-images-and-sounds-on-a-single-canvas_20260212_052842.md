# Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12221
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12221
- Reference count: 40
- Generates spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to generate spectrograms that function as both natural images and natural audio. By leveraging pre-trained text-to-image (Stable Diffusion) and text-to-spectrogram (Auffusion) diffusion models in a shared latent space, the method denoises latents with both models in parallel to produce multimodal samples. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines in both quantitative metrics (higher CLIP and CLAP scores) and human evaluations, successfully creating unique multimodal art that blends visual and acoustic elements.

## Method Summary
The method operates by sampling latents from a shared latent space and denoising them with both pre-trained diffusion models simultaneously. Starting with a noisy latent, the algorithm iteratively denoises it using conditional guidance from both the text-to-image model (for visual quality) and the text-to-spectrogram model (for audio quality). This parallel denoising process ensures the final output satisfies both visual and audio criteria, producing spectrograms that look like natural images while containing audio content that sounds natural.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baselines in quantitative evaluations with higher CLIP and CLAP scores
- Human evaluators consistently rate generated spectrograms as higher in audio and visual quality
- Successfully creates multimodal art examples like bell towers that sound like ringing bells and tigers that make roaring sounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach exploits the shared statistical properties between natural images and spectrograms, particularly low-level characteristics like edges, curves, and corners. By operating in a shared latent space, the method can leverage the complementary strengths of both diffusion models to generate content that satisfies dual modality requirements. The parallel denoising process allows the model to find latents that are likely under both distributions simultaneously, creating genuine multimodal compositions rather than simple overlays.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Generate samples by iteratively denoising noisy latents; needed for understanding the core generation mechanism; quick check: can be verified by examining the iterative denoising process
- **Latent Space Alignment**: The shared latent space between image and audio models is crucial; needed for understanding how dual modality generation works; quick check: confirmed by the successful generation of multimodal samples
- **CLIP/CLAP Scores**: Proxy metrics for visual/audio quality and alignment; needed for quantitative evaluation; quick check: scores should correlate with human judgments
- **Multimodal Composition**: Creating content that satisfies multiple sensory modalities simultaneously; needed for understanding the artistic applications; quick check: demonstrated through examples like "tiger that roars"
- **Conditional Generation**: Using text prompts to guide generation in both modalities; needed for understanding controllability; quick check: different prompts should produce correspondingly different outputs
- **Cross-modal Alignment**: Ensuring generated content is coherent across modalities; needed for understanding the quality metric; quick check: human studies validate "visually-synced" quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Text Prompt -> Shared Latent Space -> Image Diffusion Model + Audio Diffusion Model -> Spectrogram Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path is the iterative denoising process where latents are updated based on guidance from both diffusion models. Each denoising step must balance contributions from both modalities to maintain quality in both domains.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Balance between visual and audio quality vs. strict adherence to either modality
- Computational cost of running two diffusion models simultaneously
- Choice of shared latent space vs. separate spaces with mapping
- Fixed pre-trained models vs. fine-tuning for better cross-modal alignment

**Failure Signatures:**
- Output looks like an image but produces noise or silence when converted to audio
- Output sounds like audio but appears as random visual patterns
- Compromised quality in both modalities due to conflicting optimization objectives
- Mode collapse where only certain types of combinations are successfully generated

**First Experiments to Run:**
1. Generate spectrograms for simple prompts (e.g., "a circle that sounds like a beep") to verify basic functionality
2. Compare outputs using only one diffusion model at a time to quantify each model's contribution
3. Test with contradictory prompts (e.g., "a cat that sounds like a dog") to explore handling of semantic conflicts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of the overlap between natural image and natural spectrogram distributions, and can this limit be mathematically characterized?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how images and spectrograms share statistical properties and low-level characteristics like edges, curves, and corners, suggesting some overlap exists between their distributions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates practical overlap through experiments, it doesn't provide a theoretical framework for quantifying or characterizing the maximum possible intersection between these distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical proof or formal analysis showing bounds on the intersection of natural image and spectrogram distributions, or an empirical study measuring the maximum achievable overlap across all possible image-sound combinations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of diffusion model architecture affect the quality and characteristics of generated images that sound?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses specific diffusion models (Stable Diffusion and Auffusion) and discusses their shared latent space as crucial for the technique, but doesn't explore how different architectures might perform.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on one successful pair of models but doesn't investigate whether other combinations or architectural choices could yield better results or different types of multimodal compositions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different diffusion model architectures (e.g., different U-Net designs, alternative latent spaces, or non-latent diffusion models) to evaluate their impact on audio-visual alignment and generation quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the method be extended to generate images that sound with more than two modalities (e.g., adding touch or motion information)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper successfully composes two modalities and discusses the compositional nature of diffusion models, suggesting the approach could potentially be extended to more modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses exclusively on the visual-auditory intersection and doesn't explore whether the compositional framework can handle additional sensory modalities or higher-dimensional multimodal spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of the method generating examples that simultaneously align with three or more modalities (e.g., images that sound and feel a certain way, or that correspond to specific motions), along with analysis of how the compositional framework scales with additional modalities.

## Limitations
- The dual optimization may lead to compromises in either visual or audio quality
- Evaluation relies heavily on proxy metrics (CLIP/CLAP scores) rather than direct perceptual measures
- Human studies are limited to subjective ratings without systematic evaluation of audio fidelity
- The method's performance on abstract concepts and complex scenes is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- **High**: The core technical contribution of joint diffusion in shared latent space follows established diffusion model principles
- **Medium**: Performance claims of superiority over baselines rely on proxy metrics and limited human study details
- **Medium-Low**: Claims about creating "unique multimodal art" are demonstrated through examples but lack systematic evaluation of creative novelty

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing either the image or audio diffusion model to quantify the contribution of each modality to the final output
2. Perform controlled listening tests with audio experts to evaluate the perceptual quality and naturalness of the generated sounds beyond CLAP scores
3. Test the approach on a broader range of prompts, including abstract concepts and complex scenes, to assess scalability and failure modes
