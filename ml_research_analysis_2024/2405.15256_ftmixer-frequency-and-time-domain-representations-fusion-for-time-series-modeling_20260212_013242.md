core_contribution: This paper proposes FTMixer, a novel method that combines time
  and frequency domain representations for time series forecasting. The method leverages
  the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to capture global inter-series dependencies
  through a Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, and local dependencies through
  a Windowed Frequency-Time Convolution (WFTC) module.

# FTMixer: Frequency and Time Domain Representations Fusion for Time Series Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.15256
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15256
- Reference count: 40
- Combines time and frequency domain representations for time series forecasting

## Executive Summary
FTMixer introduces a novel approach to time series forecasting by fusing frequency and time domain representations. The method leverages Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to capture both global inter-series dependencies through a Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module and local dependencies through a Windowed Frequency-Time Convolution (WFTC) module. This dual-domain architecture aims to overcome the limitations of purely time-based models, particularly in capturing long-term dependencies and complex seasonal patterns.

## Method Summary
FTMixer employs a two-pronged strategy to process time series data. The FCC module uses DCT to transform time series into the frequency domain, allowing the model to capture global inter-series dependencies through convolutional operations in frequency space. The WFTC module applies windowed DCT to maintain local temporal relationships while still benefiting from frequency domain processing. These modules work in tandem to provide a comprehensive representation of the time series data, combining the strengths of both frequency and time domain analyses. The method demonstrates superior performance on complex datasets with seasonal patterns and long-term trends, while also showing improved computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves lower MSE and MAE across various prediction lengths compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates best performance on datasets with complex seasonal patterns and long-term trends
- Shows improved computational efficiency over existing time series forecasting models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FTMixer's effectiveness stems from its ability to capture both global and local dependencies in time series data through a dual-domain approach. By leveraging the DCT, the model can identify and utilize frequency-based patterns that are often missed by purely time-based models. The FCC module allows for the extraction of global inter-series relationships in the frequency domain, while the WFTC module preserves local temporal information. This combination enables the model to better handle complex seasonal patterns and long-term trends, which are common challenges in time series forecasting.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**: A Fourier-related transform used to convert time series data into the frequency domain. Why needed: To capture frequency-based patterns and global dependencies. Quick check: Verify understanding of DCT's ability to represent signals in terms of cosine functions of different frequencies.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Deep learning models using convolutional operations to extract features from data. Why needed: To process and learn from both time and frequency domain representations. Quick check: Understand how CNNs can be applied to both temporal and frequency-based data.
3. **Time Series Forecasting**: The process of predicting future values based on historical data. Why needed: To evaluate FTMixer's performance against existing methods. Quick check: Review common metrics like MSE and MAE used in time series forecasting.
4. **Frequency-Time Fusion**: The integration of frequency and time domain information for improved modeling. Why needed: To leverage the strengths of both domains for better forecasting. Quick check: Understand how frequency and time information complement each other in time series analysis.
5. **Global vs. Local Dependencies**: The distinction between long-range and short-range relationships in time series data. Why needed: To design modules that can capture both types of dependencies. Quick check: Recognize examples of global and local patterns in typical time series datasets.
6. **Computational Efficiency in Deep Learning**: The measure of a model's resource usage relative to its performance. Why needed: To evaluate FTMixer's efficiency claims compared to other methods. Quick check: Understand common efficiency metrics and their importance in model selection.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Input -> DCT -> FCC -> WFTC -> Fusion -> Output
Critical Path: The core processing flow from input through both FCC and WFTC modules to the final output, with the fusion of frequency and time domain information being the critical step.
Design Tradeoffs: Balancing the depth of frequency analysis (FCC) with the preservation of local temporal information (WFTC), while maintaining computational efficiency.
Failure Signatures: Poor performance on datasets with simple, non-seasonal patterns; increased computational overhead for very short time series; potential loss of fine-grained temporal information in the frequency domain representation.
First Experiments:
1. Compare FTMixer's performance on a dataset with clear seasonal patterns against a purely time-based model.
2. Test the model's ability to capture long-term trends by forecasting on a dataset with extended historical data.
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency by measuring inference time on datasets of varying lengths and complexities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
