# Constructing Confidence Intervals for 'the' Generalization Error -- a Comprehensive Benchmark Study

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18836
- Reference count: 40
- Compares 13 methods for constructing confidence intervals for generalization error

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive benchmark study evaluates 13 methods for constructing confidence intervals around generalization error estimates in machine learning. The research addresses the practical challenge of quantifying uncertainty when no separate test set is available, which is common in real-world applications. Through extensive experimentation across 18 datasets, 4 inducers, and 8 loss functions, the study identifies methods that provide reliable coverage while balancing computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The study systematically compares variance estimation techniques combined with resampling methods (cross-validation and bootstrapping) to construct confidence intervals. Methods were evaluated based on coverage frequency (how often the true error falls within the interval), interval width (precision), and computational runtime. The benchmark covers diverse scenarios including small datasets (n ≤ 100) and larger datasets, using both nested cross-validation and various bootstrap-based approaches with different variance estimators.

## Key Results
- Conservative-Z and Corrected Resampled-T methods consistently provided good coverage with reasonable interval widths
- Holdout-based CIs performed surprisingly well but produced wider intervals than resampling-based methods
- CV Wald method showed poor coverage for decision trees, highlighting method-learner dependencies
- For small data (n ≤ 100): Nested CV (25+ outer repetitions, K=5) or Conservative-Z (25 outer, 10+ inner) recommended
- For larger data: Corrected Resampled-T (0.9 ratio, 25+ repetitions), Nested CV (3 outer, K=5), or Conservative-Z (10 outer, K=5) recommended

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The effectiveness of Conservative-Z and Corrected Resampled-T methods stems from their robust handling of bias in variance estimation, particularly in scenarios where the loss distribution deviates from normality. The study's extensive benchmarking across diverse datasets and learners suggests these methods maintain coverage guarantees even when underlying assumptions about error distributions are violated.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on specific experimental conditions (18 datasets, 4 inducers, 8 loss functions) may not generalize to all scenarios
- Computational requirements for nested CV with 25+ outer repetitions may be prohibitive for many practitioners
- Effectiveness in domains with different data characteristics or evaluation metrics remains uncertain
- Unknown: The study did not investigate the impact of extreme class imbalance or non-i.i.d. data on method performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Conservative-Z and Corrected Resampled-T as consistently good performers
- **Medium confidence**: Specific numerical recommendations for outer/inner repetitions and K-fold values
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that holdout-based CIs perform "surprisingly well"

## Next Checks
1. Validate recommended methods on additional real-world datasets from domains not represented in the current benchmark, particularly high-dimensional or highly imbalanced data
2. Conduct cost-benefit analysis comparing statistical performance gains against computational overhead for each recommended method
3. Test stability of recommendations when using different base learners beyond the four inducers evaluated
4. Investigate performance on datasets with extreme class imbalance or non-i.i.d. data to address the unknown limitation identified
