# Movie2Story: A framework for understanding videos and telling stories in the form of novel text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.14965
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14965
- Authors: Kangning Li; Zheyang Jia; Anyu Ying
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Introduces MSBench benchmark and M2S model achieving 15% improvement over baselines for narrative video-to-text generation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating long-form, novel-style narratives from video and audio inputs. The authors identify limitations in existing multimodal benchmarks that focus on short-form outputs and lack audio integration. To address this, they introduce MSBench, a new benchmark for evaluating narrative-driven multimodal tasks, along with an automated dataset generation pipeline that reduces manual annotation burden while maintaining quality. The proposed M2S model demonstrates significant improvements over baselines, highlighting the potential of their approach for multimodal storytelling.

## Method Summary
The method involves a comprehensive pipeline for transforming video and audio inputs into narrative text. First, videos are segmented into 20-second chunks and processed using video-language models (VLMs) to extract visual descriptions. Simultaneously, audio is processed through ASR, emotion analysis, and speaker recognition systems. These features are temporally aligned and integrated through carefully designed prompts for large language models (LLMs). The framework also introduces novel reference-free evaluation metrics (ISR, InfoSim, InfoDiverse) to assess language fluency, knowledge integration, and narrative alignment. The automated dataset generation pipeline leverages existing video-text datasets and LLM-generated stories, ensuring availability of accurate auxiliary information.

## Key Results
- MSBench benchmark addresses limitations of existing multimodal evaluation by focusing on long-form, story-like outputs enriched with audio information
- M2S model achieves 15% improvement over baseline multimodal models on the new benchmark
- Current multimodal models show suboptimal performance on MSBench, highlighting gaps in handling long videos and integrating rich auxiliary information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Automatic dataset generation pipeline can reduce manual annotation burden while maintaining high-quality ground truth for multimodal storytelling.
- Mechanism: The pipeline uses existing video-text datasets, applies automated feature extraction (video captions, ASR, emotion, speaker recognition), and leverages LLMs to generate novel-style stories. Systematic filtering and state-of-the-art models ensure accuracy.
- Core assumption: Automated feature extraction and LLM-based story generation can produce high-quality, narrative-style outputs that capture both visual and audio information effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our work introduces an innovative automatic dataset generation method to ensure the availability of accurate auxiliary information."
  - [section] "Our approach features an innovative data transformation pipeline tailored to enhance existing video-text datasets... We augment them with detailed audio and visual information."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations of similar automated dataset generation approaches in the corpus.
- Break condition: If automated feature extraction fails to capture nuanced audio-visual relationships or if LLM-generated stories lack narrative coherence, the dataset quality will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: M2S pipeline improves narrative quality by integrating multimodal information through careful temporal alignment and feature fusion.
- Mechanism: Video processing segments videos into manageable chunks, extracts visual features using VLMs, processes audio for ASR, emotion, and speaker recognition, then uses LLM with carefully designed prompts to integrate information chronologically.
- Core assumption: Temporal alignment of audio and video features, combined with proper feature fusion, enables coherent narrative generation that captures both visual and audio elements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a novel model architecture and methodology to better handle the overall process, demonstrating improvements on our benchmark."
  - [section] "Our video processing pipeline first segments the video length... Then use open-source VLM and other models to extract video/image text descriptions... Our audio processing pipeline begins with the extraction of audio..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - limited direct support for specific temporal alignment techniques in multimodal storytelling.
- Break condition: If temporal alignment fails to properly match audio-visual events or if feature fusion loses critical information, narrative coherence will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Novel evaluation metrics (ISR, InfoSim, InfoDiverse) provide more accurate assessment of multimodal storytelling quality than traditional NLP metrics.
- Mechanism: These metrics evaluate language fluency, knowledge integration (visual and audio), and narrative alignment without requiring reference ground truth, addressing limitations of BLEU/ROUGE.
- Core assumption: Reference-free metrics can effectively capture the richness of multimodal narratives, including audio-related information not present in visual references.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To address this gap, we propose a set of reference-free metrics: Language Fluency, Key-knowledge Relevance... These metrics evaluate fluency, knowledge integration (including both visual and audio elements), and narrative alignment."
  - [section] "For instance, while a visual scene may depict a list of ingredients, a narration could highlight only a subset of those ingredients or incorporate additional elements like speaker emotions or environmental sounds..."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus doesn't mention these specific metrics or their validation.
- Break condition: If metrics fail to correlate with human judgment of narrative quality or if they cannot distinguish between high and low-quality multimodal stories.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal feature extraction and temporal alignment
  - Why needed here: The system relies on extracting and synchronizing visual and audio features to generate coherent narratives
  - Quick check question: How does the system ensure that audio events are properly aligned with corresponding visual scenes in the generated story?

- Concept: LLM-based story generation and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: LLMs are used to transform extracted features into narrative text, requiring careful prompt design for optimal output
  - Quick check question: What specific instructions are given to the LLM to ensure it follows the chronological order of events and integrates audio-visual information properly?

- Concept: Evaluation metric design for multimodal systems
  - Why needed here: Traditional NLP metrics are insufficient for evaluating multimodal storytelling, necessitating new metrics that capture audio-visual integration
  - Quick check question: How do ISR, InfoSim, and InfoDiverse metrics differ from traditional BLEU/ROUGE metrics in evaluating multimodal narrative quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video processing pipeline -> Audio processing pipeline -> Temporal alignment module -> LLM integration module -> Story generation -> Evaluation framework
- Critical path: Video/audio feature extraction → Temporal alignment → LLM integration → Story generation → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Automated dataset generation vs. manual annotation quality, LLM integration complexity vs. narrative coherence, comprehensive evaluation vs. metric interpretability
- Failure signatures: Poor temporal alignment causing narrative confusion, LLM generating repetitive or incoherent text, evaluation metrics failing to capture narrative quality
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test video segmentation and feature extraction on a simple video to verify proper extraction of visual descriptions
  2. Test audio processing pipeline on a short audio clip to verify ASR, emotion, and speaker recognition accuracy
  3. Test temporal alignment by feeding synchronized video/audio features to LLM and verifying chronological story generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed M2S model handle the temporal alignment of video and audio features when generating long-form narrative text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the M2S model's ability to align video and audio information but does not provide detailed insights into the specific mechanisms for temporal alignment in long-form narratives.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the use of timestamps and segmentation but does not elaborate on how these are integrated into the narrative generation process, particularly for maintaining coherence over extended periods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed experimental results or a breakdown of the M2S model's architecture showing how it processes and aligns temporal data to generate coherent long-form narratives.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in handling long-duration videos, and how does the M2S model address these limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that current MLLMs struggle with long-duration videos and integrating auxiliary information, which the M2S model aims to address.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions improvements, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the specific limitations of existing models or detailed comparisons of how M2S overcomes these challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of M2S against other MLLMs, focusing on performance metrics related to long-duration video handling and auxiliary information integration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the novel evaluation metrics proposed in the MSBench benchmark contribute to a more accurate assessment of narrative-driven multimodal tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces five novel evaluation metrics (ISR, InfoSim, InfoDiverse, SACOR, and SRCI) but does not fully explore their effectiveness or compare them to traditional metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical basis for these metrics but lacks empirical evidence or case studies demonstrating their superiority or specific contributions to narrative assessment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies or case examples showing how these metrics improve the evaluation of narrative-driven tasks compared to traditional metrics, along with user studies or expert evaluations.

## Limitations

- The proposed automated dataset generation pipeline's effectiveness is primarily supported by claims rather than direct empirical validation of dataset quality compared to manually annotated alternatives.
- While the M2S model shows a 15% improvement over baselines, the paper doesn't provide detailed ablations showing which components of the pipeline contribute most to performance gains.
- The novel evaluation metrics (ISR, InfoSim, InfoDiverse) are introduced without extensive validation against human judgments or comparison with traditional metrics on established benchmarks.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The task formulation and benchmark creation (MSBench) is clearly defined and addresses a real gap in multimodal evaluation.
- Medium confidence: The M2S pipeline architecture and its reported 15% improvement over baselines.
- Low confidence: The effectiveness of the automated dataset generation pipeline and the novel evaluation metrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Quality Validation**: Compare the quality of stories generated using the automated dataset against a smaller manually annotated subset. This would validate whether the automated pipeline truly maintains high-quality ground truth for multimodal storytelling.

2. **Component Ablation Study**: Systematically disable components of the M2S pipeline (e.g., remove temporal alignment, simplify feature fusion, modify prompts) to quantify the contribution of each element to the overall 15% improvement, identifying which innovations drive performance.

3. **Evaluation Metric Validation**: Conduct human evaluations on a subset of generated stories using both the proposed metrics (ISR, InfoSim, InfoDiverse) and traditional metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), then calculate correlation coefficients to validate whether the new metrics capture narrative quality as intended.
