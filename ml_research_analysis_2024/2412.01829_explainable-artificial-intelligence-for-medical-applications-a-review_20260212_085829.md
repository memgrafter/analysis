# Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Medical Applications: A Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01829
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01829
- Reference count: 40
- This review systematically examines XAI techniques applied to medical data across visual, audio, and multimodal domains, identifying key challenges and limitations in current approaches.

## Executive Summary
This review systematically examines explainable AI (XAI) techniques applied to medical data across visual, audio, and multimodal domains. The paper classifies 19 XAI methods based on taxonomy criteria including perception, order, model dependency, and scope. It evaluates recent applications in various medical specialties, highlighting common challenges such as data scarcity, time/resource demands, and generalisability issues. The review emphasizes the need for customised XAI techniques, improved standardisation, and stronger partnerships with healthcare institutions to advance XAI's practical implementation in medicine.

## Method Summary
The review provides a comprehensive taxonomy of XAI methods and their applications in medical domains. It systematically examines published literature to classify XAI approaches and analyze their effectiveness across different medical specialties. The methodology involves categorizing XAI techniques based on their characteristics and evaluating their performance in real-world medical applications.

## Key Results
- The review identifies perception-based, model-specific, and post-hoc XAI methods as dominant in medical applications
- Limited exploration exists for audio and multimodal domains despite their potential importance
- Major challenges include data scarcity, time/resource demands, and generalizability issues across different healthcare contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The review's effectiveness stems from its systematic classification framework that organizes XAI methods by key characteristics, enabling clear comparison across different approaches. The comprehensive coverage of medical specialties allows identification of domain-specific challenges and patterns in XAI adoption. The focus on both technical and practical implementation aspects provides a holistic view of current limitations and opportunities.

## Foundational Learning
1. **XAI Taxonomy Fundamentals** - Understanding the classification criteria for XAI methods (perception, order, model dependency, scope) is essential for evaluating their suitability in medical contexts. Quick check: Can you map a given XAI method to its appropriate taxonomy category?

2. **Medical Domain Requirements** - Different medical specialties have unique interpretability needs and data characteristics. Quick check: Identify which XAI methods are most suitable for radiology versus cardiology applications.

3. **Data Challenges in Healthcare** - Medical data presents specific challenges including scarcity, privacy concerns, and heterogeneity across institutions. Quick check: List three specific data-related barriers to XAI implementation in clinical settings.

4. **Clinical Validation Frameworks** - Understanding how XAI outputs must be validated by medical professionals for practical adoption. Quick check: Describe the key elements needed for a clinical validation study of an XAI method.

5. **Regulatory Considerations** - Healthcare AI applications must meet specific regulatory requirements that impact XAI design and deployment. Quick check: What regulatory standards must be considered when implementing XAI in medical diagnosis?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
XAI Method Classification -> Medical Application Analysis -> Challenge Identification -> Recommendation Development

**Critical Path:**
Taxonomy Classification → Application Landscape Mapping → Challenge Assessment → Implementation Recommendations

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The review balances breadth of coverage against depth of individual method analysis, choosing to provide comprehensive taxonomy over detailed technical specifications. This enables broader applicability but may miss nuanced implementation details.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Overlooking domain-specific requirements due to generic classification
- Missing emerging hybrid approaches that combine multiple XAI categories
- Underrepresenting unpublished or proprietary implementations in clinical settings

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply the proposed taxonomy to five recently published XAI methods not included in the original review
2. Conduct cross-institutional survey of healthcare practitioners to identify real-world implementation challenges
3. Perform comparative analysis of XAI method performance across multi-modal medical datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The classification framework may not capture emerging hybrid approaches that combine multiple XAI categories
- Focus on published applications potentially overlooks unpublished or proprietary implementations in clinical settings
- Challenge assessment based on reported literature rather than empirical validation across different healthcare contexts

## Confidence
- Taxonomy classification and methodology description: High confidence
- Application landscape analysis across medical specialties: Medium confidence
- Challenge identification and recommendations: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the proposed taxonomy by applying it to a broader set of recently published XAI methods not included in the original review
2. Cross-institutional survey of healthcare practitioners to assess real-world implementation challenges beyond those reported in literature
3. Comparative analysis of XAI method performance and interpretability in multi-modal medical datasets to evaluate generalizability claims
