# A Decomposition Modeling Framework for Seasonal Time-Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12168
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: 10% reduction in error compared to baseline models in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Multi-scale Seasonal Decomposition Model (MSSD) for seasonal time-series forecasting. MSSD addresses the challenge of accurately predicting future values in seasonal time series by decomposing the univariate series into three primary components: Ascending, Peak, and Descending. The model leverages linear regression for the simpler components and a specialized multi-scale convolutional network (SDNet) for the complex Peak component. The approach is validated on three publicly accessible seasonal datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The MSSD framework decomposes a 24-hour seasonal cycle into three components: Ascending (0-8h), Peak (8-16h), and Descending (16-24h). Linear regression models are applied to the Ascending and Descending components, while the Peak component is modeled using SDNet—a multi-scale convolutional network that combines Conv1d for local features and dilated causal convolutions for global dependencies. The final prediction aggregates outputs from all three components. The model is trained on three seasonal datasets (Electricity, Traffic, CAISO) using Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error as metrics across various forecasting horizons.

## Key Results
- 10% reduction in error compared to baseline models for both short-term (24, 48, 96 hours) and long-term (192, 336, 720 hours) forecasting
- Demonstrated superior performance on three publicly accessible seasonal datasets
- Gradual and consistent improvement in predictive performance with increasing input length, unlike transformer-based models which show instability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decomposing the time series into Ascending, Peak, and Descending components allows each component to be modeled with its most suitable method, reducing the complexity of modeling the full seasonal pattern. By splitting the 24-hour cycle into three parts, the model captures distinct fluctuation trends separately. The linear components use simple regression, while the complex Peak component is handled by a specialized multi-scale convolutional network. Core assumption: The seasonal pattern can be meaningfully decomposed into three segments with distinct dynamics, and these dynamics are stable enough to be captured by separate modeling strategies. Break condition: If the seasonal pattern is irregular or varies significantly across cycles, the fixed decomposition may not align well with the true underlying structure.

### Mechanism 2
The multi-scale convolutional network (SDNet) captures both local and global features of the Peak component, necessary to model complex fluctuation patterns. SDNet applies multiple multi-scale operations using Conv1d for local features and dilated causal convolutions for global dependencies, integrating them to simulate diverse temporal patterns. Core assumption: The Peak component's fluctuations are best represented by combining local detail with global context, and dilated convolutions can effectively capture these dependencies without lookahead bias. Break condition: If the Peak fluctuations are dominated by noise or are too irregular, the fixed dilation patterns may not adapt well, leading to overfitting or poor generalization.

### Mechanism 3
The multi-scale reshaping and multi-head structure in SDNet enhance the model's capacity to represent various peak fluctuation patterns. The approach uses multi-head attention-inspired scaling, where multiple scales of the input are processed in parallel, and their outputs are concatenated to integrate diverse sequence information. Core assumption: Different scales of the input capture complementary aspects of the fluctuation pattern, and concatenating these scales provides richer information than a single scale. Break condition: If the number of scales is too small, important patterns may be missed; if too large, the model may become computationally expensive without proportional gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Time series decomposition (e.g., STL, seasonal-trend decomposition)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how seasonal patterns can be separated into trend, seasonal, and residual components is foundational to the MSSD decomposition approach.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components typically extracted in seasonal time series decomposition?

- **Convolutional neural networks for time series (Conv1d, dilated convolutions)**
  - Why needed here: The SDNet module relies on 1D convolutions and dilated convolutions to capture local and global temporal features, which are essential for modeling the Peak component.
  - Quick check question: How does a dilated convolution differ from a standard convolution in terms of receptive field?

- **Linear regression for time series modeling**
  - Why needed here: The Ascending and Descending components are modeled using linear regression, so understanding when and why linear models are appropriate for trend components is important.
  - Quick check question: In what situations is linear regression a suitable model for time series components?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input series → Decomposition Module → (Ascending/Descending → Linear Regression) + (Peak → SDNet) → Concatenate → Final output

- **Critical path**:
  1. Input series → Decomposition Module
  2. Ascending/Descending → Linear Regression → Predictions
  3. Peak → SDNet (Conv1d + dilated causal conv + multi-scale reshape) → Prediction
  4. Concatenate all three predictions → Final output

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Fixed decomposition vs. learned decomposition: Fixed is simpler and interpretable but may not adapt to irregular patterns
  - Linear regression vs. more complex models: Simpler and faster but may miss subtle trends
  - Multi-scale vs. single-scale Conv: Richer feature representation but higher computational cost

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on non-seasonal or irregular patterns (decomposition assumption broken)
  - Overfitting on noise in the Peak component (too many scales or insufficient regularization)
  - Suboptimal scaling when input length changes (dilation pattern fixed)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test decomposition quality: Visualize decomposed components for different datasets to ensure they align with true seasonal structure
  2. Ablation on SDNet: Replace SDNet with a single-scale Conv1d and measure performance drop to quantify multi-scale benefit
  3. Input length sensitivity: Vary input length and observe model stability to assess long-term dependency capture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the MSSD model's performance scale with increasing input sequence length beyond what was tested? The paper mentions that with increasing input length, MSSD shows gradual and consistent improvement in predictive performance, unlike transformer-based models which show instability due to recurrent short-term patterns. This is unresolved because the paper only tested input lengths up to 720, and the scaling behavior beyond this point is unknown. Testing MSSD on datasets with much longer input sequences (e.g., 1440 or 2880) and comparing its performance to transformer models on these longer sequences would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
Can the MSSD model be effectively adapted for non-seasonal time series data, such as financial or weather data? The paper mentions that MSSD is mainly aimed at periodic time-series and cannot achieve accurate prediction for non-periodic data like Exchange and Weather. The authors plan to explore improvements for a wider range of time-series data characteristics. This is unresolved because the paper does not provide any results or analysis on the performance of MSSD on non-seasonal data. Testing MSSD on non-seasonal datasets and comparing its performance to state-of-the-art models for those specific domains would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of MSSD compare to other state-of-the-art models when applied to multivariate time series forecasting tasks? The paper provides results for multivariate forecasting, showing MSSD outperforming other models like MICN with an 18% average reduction in MSE. However, it only tests on two datasets. This is unresolved because the paper only tests on a limited number of multivariate datasets, and it's unclear how MSSD would perform on other multivariate time series with different characteristics. Testing MSSD on a wider variety of multivariate time series datasets with different characteristics and comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art multivariate forecasting models would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The decomposition into three fixed segments assumes stable and periodic seasonal patterns, which may not hold for datasets with irregular seasonality or varying cycle lengths
- The effectiveness of linear regression for trend components depends on the assumption that these segments follow approximately linear trends, potentially limiting performance on highly nonlinear seasonal patterns
- The 10% error reduction claim is difficult to verify without access to the exact implementation details, baseline model specifications, and comprehensive statistical testing across multiple runs

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general framework of decomposing seasonal time series into interpretable components is well-established in the forecasting literature, and the paper's specific application to three-component decomposition is plausible given the hourly periodicity of the datasets used.
- **Medium confidence**: The SDNet architecture's ability to capture complex peak fluctuations through multi-scale convolutions is theoretically sound, but the paper lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each architectural choice.
- **Low confidence**: The 10% error reduction claim is difficult to verify without access to the exact implementation details, baseline model specifications, and comprehensive statistical testing across multiple runs.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on decomposition boundaries**: Systematically vary the fixed boundaries between Ascending, Peak, and Descending components (e.g., test 6-10-8h vs 8-8-8h splits) and measure the impact on forecasting accuracy to assess sensitivity to decomposition choices.

2. **SDNet architectural sensitivity**: Create simplified versions of SDNet (single-scale convolutions, different dilation patterns, varying number of scales) and compare performance to quantify the contribution of each design element and identify potential overfitting.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply the trained MSSD model from one dataset to another with different seasonal patterns (e.g., train on Electricity data and test on Traffic data) to evaluate whether the fixed decomposition approach generalizes beyond its training domain.
