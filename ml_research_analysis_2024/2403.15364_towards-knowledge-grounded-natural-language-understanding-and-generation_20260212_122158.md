# Towards Knowledge-Grounded Natural Language Understanding and Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15364
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15364
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: This thesis demonstrates that grounding transformer models with diverse knowledge representations improves performance on fake news detection, cross-lingual entity-centric tasks, and multimodal knowledge-intensive tasks.

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates how transformer-based natural language understanding and generation models can benefit from grounding with knowledge representations. The research explores three key questions: whether entity knowledge extends beyond entity-centric tasks, how to effectively extract structured knowledge from noisy text, and how other forms of knowledge contribute to NLP tasks. The studies find that incorporating relevant entity knowledge improves fake news detection accuracy, entity-focused code-switching enhances zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, and diverse knowledge integration methods (including retrieval-augmentation and parametric knowledge) improve multimodal and multilingual knowledge-intensive tasks.

## Method Summary
The research employs pre-trained transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R, BART, mBART, OFA) and integrates knowledge through various techniques including entity embeddings from Wikidata, external memory modules, auxiliary training tasks, adapter-based integration, retrieval-augmentation, and data augmentation using large language models. The approach involves fine-tuning these knowledge-grounded models on diverse downstream tasks including fake news detection (LIAR, COVID-19 datasets), named entity recognition (WikiAnn), slot filling (MultiATIS++), word sense disambiguation (XL-WiC), visual question answering (OK-VQA, A-OKVQA), and commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XStoryCloze). Evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, ROUGE, and human evaluation for generated explanations.

## Key Results
- Entity knowledge integration improves fake news detection accuracy by providing factual grounding beyond surface linguistic cues
- Entity-focused code-switching significantly enhances zero-shot cross-lingual transfer performance on entity-centric tasks
- Retrieval-augmented language models reduce hallucination and improve factuality in generation tasks
- LLM-powered data augmentation improves smaller task-specific models' performance on multilingual commonsense reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Knowledge Integration Beyond Entity-Centric Tasks
Entity embeddings from knowledge bases provide factual grounding that enables models to assess truthfulness beyond surface linguistic cues. The structured factual knowledge in entities allows the model to verify claims against external knowledge, which is particularly valuable for tasks like fake news detection where linguistic features alone may be insufficient.

### Mechanism 2: Multilingual Entity Knowledge via Code-Switching
Code-switching entities in English to their multilingual counterparts creates training instances that expose the model to cross-lingual entity representations while preserving syntactic structure. Since entities contain external knowledge and do not alter sentence syntax when replaced, this approach effectively teaches the model to handle entities across languages without introducing syntactic noise.

### Mechanism 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Factuality
Retrieval-augmented language models dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge by finding pertinent passages/documents that serve as context for the generator. This approach reduces hallucination by grounding output in retrieved facts and enables up-to-date knowledge integration without requiring model retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer Architecture and Attention Mechanism**: All models in the thesis are based on transformers, and understanding attention is crucial for grasping how knowledge is integrated and how cross-lingual transfer works. *Quick check: What is the difference between self-attention and cross-attention in transformers?*

- **Knowledge Representation (Structured vs. Unstructured)**: The thesis distinguishes between structured knowledge (knowledge bases) and unstructured knowledge (raw text, parametric knowledge), with different integration methods applying to each. *Quick check: What are the main differences between knowledge bases and parametric knowledge stored in language models?*

- **Cross-Lingual Transfer and Zero-Shot Learning**: The thesis extensively studies cross-lingual transfer, particularly for low-resource languages, and understanding the challenges and methods is essential. *Quick check: What are the main challenges in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, and how does entity knowledge help address them?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Collection (Wikipedia dumps, Wikidata, web corpora) -> Knowledge Integration (entity linking, knowledge base alignment, adapter-based integration) -> Model Architecture (BERT, RoBERTa, mBART, multimodal transformers) -> Downstream Tasks (fake news detection, NER, slot filling, VQA) -> Evaluation (accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE, human evaluation)

- **Critical path**: Data Collection → Knowledge Integration → Model Training → Downstream Task Evaluation → Analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Structured vs. Unstructured Knowledge: Structured knowledge provides explicit grounding but requires alignment; unstructured knowledge is more flexible but may be less reliable
  - Monolingual vs. Multilingual: Monolingual models are easier to train but limited in scope; multilingual models enable cross-lingual transfer but require more data and careful handling of language diversity
  - Generative vs. Discriminative: Generative models allow for more flexible output but may be more prone to hallucination; discriminative models are more focused but less adaptable

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low accuracy on downstream tasks: Could indicate poor knowledge integration, irrelevant knowledge base, or insufficient training data
  - High hallucination rate: Could indicate over-reliance on parametric knowledge, poor grounding, or insufficient negative examples in training data
  - Poor cross-lingual transfer: Could indicate insufficient language diversity in training data, poor entity alignment, or inadequate handling of morphological inflection

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train a baseline model (e.g., BERT) on a monolingual fake news detection dataset and evaluate accuracy
  2. Integrate Wikidata entity embeddings into the baseline model and evaluate if accuracy improves on the same dataset
  3. Create an entity-centric code-switched corpus from Wikipedia and Wikidata, train a multilingual model on it, and evaluate cross-lingual transfer on NER or slot filling tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the mixture-of-experts approach for knowledge integration effectively address the limitations of static knowledge bases in real-world applications? The paper discusses the potential of extending adapter approaches and leveraging different knowledge sources to train distinct adapters, enabling LLMs to adapt to various domains. However, it does not provide concrete experiments or evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Conducting experiments comparing mixture-of-experts approaches with static knowledge base integration methods on diverse real-world tasks and datasets would provide insights into their relative effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
How can we develop evaluation metrics that accurately capture the factuality and faithfulness of text generation in knowledge-grounded NLP tasks? The paper emphasizes the need for advancements in factuality and faithfulness in text generation, highlighting the limitations of current evaluation metrics in capturing these aspects. Proposing and validating new evaluation metrics specifically designed for knowledge-grounded text generation tasks, and comparing their performance against existing metrics on benchmark datasets, would provide evidence for their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
Can LLM-powered data augmentation consistently improve the performance of task-specific models across different languages and tasks, and what are the limitations of this approach? While the paper provides evidence for the benefits of LLM-powered data augmentation, it does not fully explore the limitations and potential drawbacks of this approach. Conducting extensive experiments across a wider range of languages, tasks, and model sizes, and analyzing the factors that contribute to the success or failure of LLM-powered data augmentation, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its limitations and potential.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of entity knowledge for non-entity-centric tasks depends heavily on the knowledge base being both up-to-date and sufficiently comprehensive for specific domains
- Multilingual code-switching assumes high-quality, unambiguous entity translations across all target languages, which may not hold for morphologically rich languages or those with limited digital resources
- Retrieval-augmented generation claims depend on the quality and relevance of retrieved passages, which can vary significantly based on the retriever's architecture and training data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about entity knowledge improving fake news detection when knowledge bases are current and relevant; effectiveness of entity-focused code-switching for cross-lingual transfer when entity translations are accurate
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about retrieval-augmented generation improving factuality; benefits of LLM-powered data augmentation across languages
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about mixture-of-experts approaches for knowledge integration without empirical validation; effectiveness of proposed evaluation metrics for factuality

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the fake news detection experiment with Wikidata entity embeddings on LIAR and COVID-19 datasets to verify the claimed accuracy improvements
2. Implement entity-focused code-switching on Wikipedia and Wikidata to create a multilingual corpus and evaluate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on WikiAnn
3. Conduct error analysis on retrieval-augmented generation outputs to identify failure modes and conditions where hallucination persists despite knowledge grounding
