# MVP-Bench: Can Large Vision--Language Models Conduct Multi-level Visual Perception Like Humans?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04345
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04345
- Reference count: 40
- Large vision-language models perform significantly better on low-level perception tasks than high-level semantic interpretation tasks

## Executive Summary
MVP-Bench is the first benchmark designed to evaluate multi-level visual perception in large vision-language models, mirroring how humans process images at both low-level (object recognition) and high-level (semantic interpretation) stages. The benchmark constructs 530 image pairs (natural and manipulated) with corresponding questions across five high-level and thirteen low-level perception categories. Experiments on 12 LVLMs reveal a significant performance gap: high-level perception tasks are more challenging, with the best model achieving only 56% accuracy on Yes/No questions compared to 74% for low-level tasks. Additionally, models perform worse on manipulated images than natural ones, highlighting difficulties in generalizing synthetic visual semantics.

## Method Summary
The MVP-Bench benchmark evaluates 12 large vision-language models (10 open-source, 2 closed-source) on multi-level visual perception tasks using 530 {natural, manipulated} image pairs from the EMU dataset. Each pair has corresponding questions across five high-level and thirteen low-level perception categories. Models are evaluated zero-shot using VLMEvalKit on three question types: Yes/No, multiple-choice, and fill-in-the-blank. Image manipulation is performed using Stable Diffusion Inpaint, Instruct-Pix2Pix, and Segment-Anything to create semantically different image pairs. Questions are generated via ChatGPT and verified by human annotators. Performance is measured using accuracy metrics for both single-image and cross-image evaluation tasks.

## Key Results
- LVLMs show 56% accuracy on high-level perception Yes/No questions versus 74% on low-level tasks
- Performance drops significantly on manipulated images compared to natural images
- GPT-4o achieves the highest overall performance but still struggles with high-level semantic interpretation
- Cross-image evaluation reveals consistency issues in LVLMs' contextual understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-level perception tasks expose LVLMs' inherent limitations in integrating visual and semantic understanding
- Mechanism: By designing benchmark tasks that require both low-level object recognition and high-level semantic interpretation, the evaluation reveals performance gaps between different perception levels
- Core assumption: Visual perception in humans involves hierarchical processing from low-level features to high-level semantic understanding
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Humans perform visual perception at multiple levels, including low-level object recognition and high-level semantic interpretation such as behavior understanding"
  - [section] "We thoroughly design five high-level and thirteen low-level perception categories"
- Break condition: If LVLMs achieve similar performance across all perception levels

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Synthetic image manipulation reveals LVLMs' generalization weaknesses compared to human perception
- Mechanism: Creating image pairs with manipulated content tests whether LVLMs can understand the semantic implications of visual changes
- Core assumption: Humans can easily interpret the semantic implications of subtle visual changes, while LVLMs struggle with this generalization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, the performance gap between natural and manipulated images indicates that current LVLMs do not generalize in understanding the visual semantics of synthetic images as humans do"
  - [section] "Each {natural, manipulated} image pair in MVP-Bench conveys significantly different multi-level perceptions"
- Break condition: If LVLMs perform equally well on natural and manipulated images

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-image evaluation tasks effectively measure LVLMs' contextual understanding and consistency
- Mechanism: By asking the same question across image pairs and requiring different answers, the benchmark tests whether LVLMs can maintain contextual awareness
- Core assumption: Humans naturally recognize contextual differences between related images, while LVLMs may fail to maintain this consistency
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We calculateqAcc and iAcc based on question- and image-level accuracy, respectively"
  - [section] "We further explore the performance gap in LVLMs on natural and manipulated images in Section 5"
- Break condition: If LVLMs consistently provide the same answers to the same questions across different images

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical visual processing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how humans process visual information from low-level features to high-level semantic interpretation is crucial for designing appropriate evaluation benchmarks
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between low-level object recognition and high-level semantic interpretation in visual perception?

- Concept: Synthetic data generation for evaluation
  - Why needed here: Creating manipulated images that test semantic understanding requires knowledge of image generation techniques and careful design
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when generating synthetic images to test semantic understanding rather than just object recognition?

- Concept: Benchmark design and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Designing effective evaluation benchmarks requires understanding different types of questions, evaluation metrics, and how to measure performance across different perception levels
  - Quick check question: How would you design metrics to evaluate performance on cross-image tasks that require contextual understanding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image generation pipeline (Stable Diffusion, Segment-Anything, Instruct-Pix2Pix) -> Question generation system (ChatGPT) -> Evaluation framework (VLMEvalKit) -> Performance analysis tools
- Critical path: Image manipulation → Question generation → Model evaluation → Performance analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using synthetic images provides controlled semantic variations but may introduce artifacts that affect model performance
  - Multiple question types (Yes/No, MCQ, Cross-Image) provide comprehensive evaluation but increase complexity
  - Manual verification ensures quality but limits scalability
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on manipulated images suggests generalization issues
  - Large performance gaps between high and low-level tasks indicate hierarchical understanding problems
  - Inconsistent answers across image pairs suggest contextual awareness issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a simple baseline model on both natural and manipulated image pairs to establish baseline performance differences
  2. Test the effect of different question types (Yes/No vs MCQ) on model performance to understand evaluation sensitivity
  3. Compare open-source vs closed-source models on high-level perception tasks to identify architectural differences in semantic understanding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LVLMs on multi-level visual perception benchmarks change when using different types of synthetic image manipulation techniques?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses using synthetic images and manipulated images to test LVLMs' performance
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily focuses on a specific set of manipulations and does not compare the impact of different manipulation techniques
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using various manipulation techniques and analyzing their impact on LVLMs' performance across different perception levels

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the size and architecture of LVLMs influence their ability to perform high-level visual perception tasks compared to low-level tasks?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper highlights a performance gap between high-level and low-level visual perception tasks
- Why unresolved: While the paper notes performance differences, it does not deeply explore the relationship between model architecture, size, and task-specific performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of various LVLMs with different sizes and architectures, correlating their performance on high-level and low-level tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do LVLMs' interpretations of manipulated images differ from their interpretations of natural images, and what underlying factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses performance gaps between natural and manipulated images
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies performance differences but does not fully explore the reasons behind these differences
- What evidence would resolve it: In-depth analysis of LVLMs' responses to manipulated versus natural images, identifying specific factors that contribute to interpretation differences

## Limitations
- Potential domain shift introduced by synthetic image manipulation may not generalize to natural scenarios
- Reliance on ChatGPT for question generation may introduce subtle biases despite human verification
- Manual verification process limits scalability and may not catch all subtle quality issues

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The finding that LVLMs perform better on low-level perception tasks than high-level ones is well-supported by systematic evaluation across 12 models and multiple perception categories.

**Medium Confidence:** The performance gap between natural and manipulated images is robust, but the exact mechanisms driving this gap require further investigation.

**Medium Confidence:** Cross-image evaluation effectively reveals consistency issues, though the specific question design may influence these results.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LVLMs on naturally occurring image pairs with semantic differences to distinguish between generation artifacts and genuine semantic understanding limitations
2. Conduct ablation studies on question formulation by varying prompt styles while maintaining semantic content to isolate the effect of question design
3. Test LVLMs on additional manipulated image datasets with different generation methodologies to assess generalization of performance patterns
