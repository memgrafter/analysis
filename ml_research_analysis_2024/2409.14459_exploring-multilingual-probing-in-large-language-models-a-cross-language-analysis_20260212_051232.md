# Exploring Multilingual Probing in Large Language Models: A Cross-Language Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.14459
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14459
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Primary result:** High-resource languages consistently achieve significantly higher probing accuracy compared to low-resource languages across 16 diverse languages in five open-source LLM models

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates multilingual probing in large language models by extending probing techniques beyond English to analyze 16 diverse languages. The authors conduct experiments across five open-source LLM models, examining probing accuracy, layer-wise trends, and representational similarities between languages. Key findings reveal that high-resource languages consistently achieve significantly higher probing accuracy compared to low-resource languages, with accuracy improving substantially in deeper layers for high-resource languages but remaining relatively stable for low-resource languages. The study also finds that high-resource languages exhibit higher representational similarities among themselves, while low-resource languages demonstrate lower similarities both among themselves and with high-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct multilingual probing experiments using linear classifier probing with logistic regression (L2 regularization) on hidden states extracted from LLM layers. They create datasets by translating English prompts and sentences to 15 target languages using Google Translate, creating balanced training and test splits (8:2 ratio). The experiments analyze two datasets - Cities (factual knowledge about city locations) and Opinion (sentiment classification about hotels) - across five open-source LLM models (Qwen-0.5B, Qwen-1.8B, Qwen-7B, Gemma-2B, Gemma-7B). For each layer and language combination, they train logistic regression classifiers and evaluate probing accuracy, while also computing cosine similarities between probing vectors across languages to assess representational similarities.

## Key Results
- High-resource languages consistently achieve significantly higher probing accuracy compared to low-resource languages across all five examined LLM models
- Accuracy improves substantially in deeper layers for high-resource languages but remains relatively stable for low-resource languages
- High-resource languages exhibit higher representational similarities among themselves, while low-resource languages demonstrate lower similarities both among themselves and with high-resource languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear classifier probing**: Why needed - To assess what linguistic information is encoded in different layers of LLMs by training simple classifiers on hidden states; Quick check - Verify that classifier performance correlates with information availability in embeddings
- **Cosine similarity for vector comparison**: Why needed - To quantify representational similarities between languages by measuring angular distance between probing vectors; Quick check - Ensure cosine similarity values range between -1 and 1
- **Layer-wise analysis**: Why needed - To understand how linguistic information evolves through the network depth in multilingual contexts; Quick check - Confirm that deeper layers capture more abstract linguistic features
- **Resource-based language categorization**: Why needed - To systematically compare performance across languages with varying availability of training data and resources; Quick check - Verify that categorization aligns with established linguistic resource rankings
- **Train-test split validation**: Why needed - To ensure reliable evaluation of probing performance by preventing data leakage; Quick check - Confirm that splits maintain class balance and are applied consistently
- **Multilingual prompt translation**: Why needed - To create comparable stimuli across languages for systematic analysis; Quick check - Validate that translations preserve semantic meaning across target languages

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Google Translate API -> Prompt Generation -> Dataset Creation -> LLM Hidden State Extraction -> Logistic Regression Training -> Probing Accuracy Evaluation -> Cosine Similarity Computation

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from prompt generation through dataset creation, model inference to extract hidden states, classifier training, and finally evaluation of both accuracy and representational similarities. The most time-intensive steps are the LLM inference across all layers and languages, followed by training multiple classifiers for each layer-language combination.

### Design Tradeoffs
The authors chose linear classifier probing for its simplicity and interpretability, sacrificing potential accuracy gains from more complex probing methods. They used Google Translate for dataset creation, which ensures consistency but may introduce translation artifacts. The selection of only five LLM models provides focused analysis but limits generalizability across model architectures. The focus on two specific tasks (Cities and Opinion) allows deep analysis but may not capture the full range of multilingual capabilities.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor probing accuracy across all languages suggests either inadequate model capacity or problematic dataset creation
- Inconsistent accuracy patterns between train and test sets indicate overfitting or data leakage issues
- Disproportionately low accuracy for specific languages may indicate translation quality issues or insufficient model training on those languages
- Unexpectedly high representational similarity between distant language pairs could indicate prompt template artifacts

### 3 First Experiments
1. Verify translation quality by comparing machine-translated prompts against human translations for a subset of languages
2. Test probing accuracy on a held-out validation set to ensure proper model generalization
3. Compare probing results across different random seeds to assess stability of the findings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do the observed accuracy disparities between high-resource and low-resource languages stem from inherent model limitations or from the quality of translation used in generating prompts?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit - The paper acknowledges using Google Translate for prompt generation and notes this may introduce noise.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not separate the effects of translation quality from inherent model limitations in processing different languages.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Direct experiments comparing model performance using native prompts versus translated prompts for the same languages, or analysis of translation quality metrics across languages.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Would more sophisticated probing methods beyond linear classifiers reveal different representational similarities between high-resource and low-resource languages?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit - The paper explicitly states it plans to explore more sophisticated probing methods beyond linear classifiers in future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study only uses linear classifier probing, which may be too simplistic to capture complex linguistic representations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments using non-linear probing methods (e.g., MLP probes, attention-based probes) to assess whether they reveal different patterns of representational similarities.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How would the inclusion of visual information in multimodal models affect the representational disparities between high-resource and low-resource languages?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit - The authors state plans to extend research to multimodal models incorporating visual and textual information.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study only examines text-based language models, leaving open the question of how visual grounding might affect multilingual representations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing representational similarities and accuracy patterns in multimodal models versus text-only models across the same set of languages.

## Limitations
- The use of Google Translate for dataset creation introduces potential artifacts in the translated data, though this approach was consistently applied across all languages
- The study focuses on two specific tasks (Cities and Opinion) which may not fully represent the broader landscape of multilingual knowledge representation
- The analysis of only five LLM models, while providing meaningful insights, limits the scope of model architecture comparisons
- The reliance on linear probing as the sole probing methodology may miss more complex information encoding patterns that could be revealed through alternative probing techniques

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core findings about accuracy disparities and layer-wise trends between high-resource and low-resource languages
- **Medium confidence:** Broader claims about representational similarities due to limited scope of probing methodology and model architectures examined
- **Low confidence:** Universal claims about multilingual LLM behavior given the specific experimental conditions and datasets used

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiments using professionally translated datasets instead of machine-translated ones to validate the robustness of findings against translation artifacts
2. Extend the analysis to additional probing tasks and more diverse model architectures to test the generalizability of observed patterns
3. Implement alternative probing methodologies (e.g., non-linear probes, attention-based probing) to verify whether linear probing captures the full extent of cross-lingual representational similarities
