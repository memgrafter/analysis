# Large Language Models Are Active Critics in NLG Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10724
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10724
- Authors: Shuying Xu; Junjie Hu; Ming Jiang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 6.8% improvement in correlation with human judgments over state-of-the-art baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ACTIVE-CRITIC, a novel LLM-based evaluation method that transforms language models from "passive critics" to "active critics" by self-inferring NLG tasks and evaluation criteria from human-scored data. The method operates in two stages: first automatically deriving task descriptions and evaluation criteria from example data, then dynamically optimizing prompts to generate human-aligned scores with detailed justifications. Experiments across four NLG tasks using four different LLMs show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with the task inference stage contributing more to effectiveness than the scoring stage.

## Method Summary
ACTIVE-CRITIC is a two-stage LLM-based evaluation method that first infers task descriptions and evaluation criteria from human-scored examples, then optimizes prompts to generate human-aligned scores. The task inference stage uses ensemble averaging across mini-batches of examples to derive accurate task characteristics and evaluation criteria. The scoring alignment stage employs dynamic prompt optimization through correlation maximization, iteratively sampling demonstration examples and selecting the best-performing set based on Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau correlation metrics. The method requires as few as five human-scored examples to achieve strong performance and operates through in-context learning rather than fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 6.8% improvement in correlation with human judgments over state-of-the-art baselines
- Task inference stage contributes more to performance than scoring alignment stage
- Requires only five human-scored examples to achieve strong performance
- Consistent improvements across four different LLMs and four NLG tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task inference from human-scored data enables the LLM to self-discover evaluation criteria without manual specification
- Mechanism: The LLM analyzes mini-batches of human-scored examples, inferring task characteristics and generating evaluation criteria through ensemble averaging across batches
- Core assumption: Human-scored data contains sufficient implicit information about evaluation criteria for the LLM to extract
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "self-inferring the target NLG task and relevant evaluation criteria"
  - [section] "we instruct an LLM to formulate an accurate task description T by reviewing examples in Dtrain"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus provides no direct evidence about task inference mechanisms
- Break condition: Insufficient diversity in human-scored examples, or examples too sparse to reveal implicit criteria patterns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamic prompt optimization through correlation maximization improves scoring alignment with human judgments
- Mechanism: Iteratively samples different demonstration examples, evaluates their correlation with human scores using multiple correlation metrics, and selects the best-performing set
- Core assumption: The correlation between LLM-predicted and human scores can be meaningfully optimized through demonstration example selection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we design an objective function to maximize the correlation between these two score lists"
  - [section] "we calculate the sum of three widely-used correlation coefficients: Pearson (γ), Spearman (ρ), and Kendall (τ)"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence about prompt optimization effectiveness in corpus
- Break condition: Correlation metrics fail to capture the true alignment quality, or optimization converges to local maxima

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-grained multi-criteria scoring followed by aggregation produces better overall quality scores than direct overall scoring
- Mechanism: LLM first scores each individual criterion with explanations, then synthesizes these into an overall score with comprehensive justification
- Core assumption: Breaking down complex evaluation tasks into simpler sub-tasks improves performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we hypothesize that starting with fine-grained, criteria-specific scoring can help the model further derive an accurate overall quality score"
  - [section] "The larger performance drop in the variant w/o OS-E, compared to the one w/o McS-E"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence supporting multi-stage scoring benefits
- Break condition: Aggregation method fails to properly weight individual criteria, or individual criterion scores are unreliable

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Correlation metrics (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
  - Why needed here: To measure alignment between LLM predictions and human judgments across different statistical properties
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients?

- Concept: In-context learning with demonstration examples
  - Why needed here: To guide LLM evaluation through examples rather than fine-tuning, enabling zero-shot adaptation
  - Quick check question: How does the number and selection of demonstration examples affect in-context learning performance?

- Concept: Prompt optimization through iterative refinement
  - Why needed here: To automatically discover optimal demonstration examples for maximum correlation with human judgments
  - Quick check question: What optimization strategies are appropriate when the objective function is expensive to evaluate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task inference (description + criteria) -> Multi-criteria scoring -> Overall scoring -> Prompt optimization loop
- Critical path: Task inference -> Scoring alignment (with prompt optimization) -> Evaluation output
- Design tradeoffs: Zero-shot flexibility vs. fine-tuning accuracy; computational cost of prompt optimization vs. evaluation quality
- Failure signatures: Poor correlation with human judgments; inconsistent explanations across similar examples; criteria that don't match human priorities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test task inference with varying numbers of examples to find minimum effective dataset size
  2. Compare correlation performance with and without prompt optimization across different base LLMs
  3. Evaluate whether fine-grained scoring improves overall quality predictions compared to direct overall scoring

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ACTIVE-CRITIC's performance scale with different dataset sizes beyond the tested 5%, 15%, and 25% benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tested performance with 5-shot, 5%, 15%, and 25% labeled data but didn't explore intermediate points or larger fractions
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested specific data size thresholds without examining the full learning curve or saturation point
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional experiments testing 1%, 10%, 20%, and 50% data fractions to map the complete performance-to-data relationship

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects of the task inference stage contribute most to ACTIVE-CRITIC's performance gains compared to the scoring alignment stage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Further analysis highlights that the task inference stage contributes more to ACTIVE-CRITIC's performance than the scoring stage"
- Why unresolved: While the paper notes the task inference stage is more important, it doesn't break down which specific components (task description vs. criteria definition) drive this difference
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies isolating task description generation, criteria definition, and their combinations to quantify individual contributions

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ACTIVE-CRITIC perform when evaluated on NLG tasks outside the four benchmark domains (summarization, dialogue, data-to-text, storytelling)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tested only four NLG tasks and one generalization experiment, leaving other task types unexplored
- Why unresolved: The paper's generalization test was limited to Newsroom summarization, not testing entirely different NLG paradigms
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying ACTIVE-CRITIC to tasks like machine translation, question generation, or code generation to test domain transfer

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the computational overhead of ACTIVE-CRITIC compared to baseline methods, particularly for the dynamic prompt optimization stage?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using DSPy with random search but doesn't report runtime or computational costs
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on correlation metrics but omits practical deployment considerations like inference time and GPU memory requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking experiments measuring wall-clock time, GPU memory usage, and token counts for ACTIVE-CRITIC versus baselines across different hardware configurations

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation on diverse NLG tasks beyond the four benchmark domains tested
- Computational overhead of dynamic prompt optimization not fully characterized
- Performance degradation with minimal data not systematically explored

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core technical approach of using task inference followed by prompt optimization is well-specified and methodologically sound. The experimental results showing consistent improvements over baselines across multiple datasets and LLMs are convincing.

**Medium confidence**: The claim about requiring only five examples for effective performance needs more rigorous testing across diverse task types. The contribution of task inference versus scoring alignment is estimated but could benefit from more systematic ablation studies.

**Low confidence**: The paper doesn't adequately address potential biases introduced by the inference process or how the method handles edge cases and out-of-distribution examples. The computational cost of the prompt optimization process is not fully characterized.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset size sensitivity analysis**: Systematically test performance across varying numbers of human-scored examples (5, 10, 50, 100, 500) to establish the minimum effective dataset size and identify performance plateaus or drops.

2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Apply ACTIVE-CRITIC to completely different NLG tasks not represented in the original benchmark datasets (e.g., poetry generation, technical documentation, code generation) to assess domain transfer capabilities.

3. **Long-term stability evaluation**: Run repeated evaluations on the same datasets over time to check for consistency and identify any performance drift, particularly in the prompt optimization stage where randomization might affect results.
