core_contribution: This paper introduces a novel method for generative object insertion
  in 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using a multi-view diffusion model (MVInpainter).
  Unlike existing methods that rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization
  or single-view inpainting, which often produce low-quality results, the proposed
  approach leverages a multi-view diffusion model built on Stable Video Diffusion
  with a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to generate view-consistent
  object inpainting results.

# Generative Object Insertion in Gaussian Splatting with a Multi-View Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16938
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16938
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MVInpainter achieves CTIS 0.2977, DTIS 0.2033, MUSIQ 71.391, outperforming MVIP-NeRF (CTIS 0.2682, DTIS 0.1054, MUSIQ 38.177)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MVInpainter, a novel method for generative object insertion in 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using a multi-view diffusion model. The approach addresses limitations of existing methods that rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization or single-view inpainting, which often produce low-quality results. MVInpainter first generates coarse geometry via SDS, then uses a multi-view diffusion model built on Stable Video Diffusion with a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to generate view-consistent inpainted images. A mask-aware 3D reconstruction technique refines the Gaussian Splatting from these sparse inpainted views, ensuring harmonious integration with the original scene. The method demonstrates superior performance in generating diverse, high-quality, and view-consistent object insertions.

## Method Summary
MVInpainter combines SDS optimization for coarse geometry generation with a multi-view diffusion model for view-consistent inpainting. The method uses a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to integrate depth maps, masks, and background images into the Stable Video Diffusion model, ensuring precise viewpoint consistency and background preservation. A mask-aware reconstruction technique is then applied to refine the 3D Gaussian Splatting from the inpainted views, leveraging both the generated views and original training views to minimize artifacts. The approach is trained on a Wild-RGBD dataset and evaluated on SPIn-NeRF and MipNeRF-360 datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in view-consistency, edit effectiveness, and rendering authenticity over existing methods.

## Key Results
- CTIS: 0.2977 (MVInpainter) vs 0.2682 (MVIP-NeRF) - superior consistency with textual descriptions
- DTIS: 0.2033 (MVInpainter) vs 0.1054 (MVIP-NeRF) - improved edit effectiveness
- MUSIQ: 71.391 (MVInpainter) vs 38.177 (MVIP-NeRF) - enhanced rendering authenticity
- Excels in handling complex scenes while preserving background integrity
- Generates objects with realistic appearance and geometry

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MVInpainter avoids over-smoothing and saturation issues of SDS optimization by using multi-view inpainting instead of direct 3D optimization.
- Mechanism: The method generates coarse geometry via SDS, then uses multi-view inpainting to create view-consistent content. This preserves detail and avoids the averaging and randomness inherent in SDS optimization of final outputs.
- Core assumption: Inpainted views capture sufficient 3D geometry and texture detail for high-quality 3D reconstruction without direct SDS optimization.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] contrasts with SDS-based methods; [section 2.2] explains quality issues in SDS methods.
- Break condition: If multi-view inpainting fails to generate view-consistent content or 3D reconstruction introduces significant artifacts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ControlNet-based conditional injection provides precise control over viewpoint consistency and background preservation.
- Mechanism: ControlNet takes depth maps, masks, and background images as hints and injects them into SVD generation, ensuring generated frames align with camera trajectory and maintain consistent foreground content.
- Core assumption: ControlNet hints are sufficient to guide diffusion model to produce viewpoint-consistent and background-harmonious results.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] describes ControlNet integration; [section 5.4] demonstrates improved 3D consistency.
- Break condition: If ControlNet hints are not discriminative enough (inaccurate depth or imprecise masks).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mask-aware reconstruction mitigates floating and noisy artifacts by leveraging both inpainted and original training views.
- Mechanism: Loss function applied only to unmasked regions in training views and all regions in inpainted views, preserving background and properly integrating target object.
- Core assumption: Original training views provide sufficient background supervision to prevent artifacts in regions not covered by inpainted views.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] introduces mask-aware finetuning; [section 5.4] shows minimized artifacts.
- Break condition: If inpainted views don't cover sufficient viewpoints or original training views aren't representative.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion models and SDS**: Understanding how diffusion models work and how SDS uses them for 3D optimization is crucial for grasping why MVInpainter avoids SDS for final output. Quick check: What is the main difference between using a diffusion model for image generation and using it via SDS for 3D optimization?

- **Multi-view consistency in 3D reconstruction**: The method relies on generating consistent views across multiple camera positions, essential for high-quality 3D reconstruction. Quick check: Why is it important for inpainted views to be consistent across different camera positions in this method?

- **Gaussian Splatting and reconstruction**: The final output is 3D Gaussian Splatting, so understanding how it works and how it's optimized from multi-view images is necessary. Quick check: What is the key advantage of Gaussian Splatting over NeRF for real-time novel view synthesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Original 3D Gaussian -> SDS optimization for coarse geometry -> MVInpainter with ControlNet injection -> Mask-aware 3D Gaussian reconstruction -> Edited 3D Gaussian Splatting scene

- **Critical path**:
  1. Generate coarse geometry via SDS optimization
  2. Derive backgrounds, masks, and depth maps from original and coarse Gaussians
  3. Sample inpainting viewpoints along circular trajectory
  4. Generate view-consistent inpainted images using MVInpainter
  5. Reconstruct final 3D Gaussian using mask-aware reconstruction

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using SDS only for coarse geometry vs. direct optimization: Reduces over-smoothing but requires additional inpainting step
  - Multi-view inpainting vs. single-view inpainting: Ensures view consistency but requires more complex model architecture
  - Mask-aware reconstruction vs. reconstruction from inpainted views only: Preserves background integrity but requires careful loss formulation

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Over-smooth or blurry objects: Indicates issues with multi-view inpainting consistency or reconstruction
  - Floating artifacts: Suggests insufficient background supervision in mask-aware reconstruction
  - Background inconsistencies: Points to problems with ControlNet guidance or mask-aware reconstruction
  - Viewpoint misalignment: Indicates issues with inpainting trajectory or ControlNet module

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replace MVInpainter with single-view inpainting and compare view consistency
  2. Remove ControlNet module and observe changes in viewpoint alignment and background preservation
  3. Disable mask-aware reconstruction and evaluate background artifacts in novel views

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MVInpainter performance change with different numbers of inpainting views, and what is optimal number for quality vs. computational efficiency?
- Basis: Paper mentions 14 inpainting views from 120-degree trajectory but provides no ablation study on varying view numbers
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore how number of inpainting views affects quality or computational cost
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing performance with different numbers of inpainting views and analysis of quality vs. efficiency trade-off

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can MVInpainter be extended to handle 360-degree object insertion, and what are challenges and potential solutions?
- Basis: Paper mentions current model is limited by lack of training data for 360-degree content generation
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore feasibility of 360-degree extension or discuss potential solutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating 360-degree object insertion performance and discussion of challenges and solutions

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can MVInpainter be adapted for object removal tasks, and what are key differences between insertion and removal?
- Basis: Paper mentions current model cannot be directly extended to effective object removal due to background alignment challenges
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore potential adaptation for object removal or discuss key differences in inpainting process
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating object removal performance and discussion of key differences and potential solutions

## Limitations

- Reliance on ControlNet assumes injected hints (depth, masks, background) are sufficiently accurate and discriminative, which may not hold for all scene geometries
- Mask-aware reconstruction effectiveness depends on quality and coverage of original training views, not evaluated under challenging conditions
- SDS optimization, while used only for coarse geometry, may still introduce biases that subsequent steps cannot fully correct

## Confidence

- **High**: View consistency improvements over baseline methods (CTIS, DTIS metrics)
- **Medium**: Background preservation claims (depends on mask-aware reconstruction quality)
- **Medium**: Generalization to complex scenes (limited evaluation on challenging datasets)

## Next Checks

1. Test method on scenes with highly occluded or sparse backgrounds to evaluate mask-aware reconstruction robustness
2. Compare MVInpainter performance when using inaccurate depth maps or imprecise masks to assess ControlNet dependency
3. Evaluate view consistency and artifact levels when replacing coarse SDS geometry with simpler baseline (e.g., bounding box expansion)
