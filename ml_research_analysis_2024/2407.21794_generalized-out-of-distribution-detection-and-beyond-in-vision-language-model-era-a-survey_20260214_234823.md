# Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection and Beyond in Vision Language Model Era: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21794
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21794
- Reference count: 40
- This survey introduces a new framework, generalized OOD detection v2, that updates the taxonomy of OOD detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection, open set recognition, and outlier detection in the vision language model (VLM) era.

## Executive Summary
This survey presents a comprehensive framework for understanding out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and anomaly detection in the vision language model (VLM) era. The authors introduce "generalized OOD detection v2" which clarifies the evolving relationships between related fields by identifying inactivity and integration patterns. They focus on CLIP-based approaches for both OOD detection and anomaly detection, highlighting how VLMs enable zero-shot and few-shot methods that are more efficient than traditional approaches. The survey also discusses early advancements in the large vision language model (LVLM) era and identifies key challenges and future research directions.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involves systematic literature review and analysis of five related fields (OOD detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection, open set recognition, and outlier detection) through the lens of VLM adoption. For CLIP-based methods, the paper reviews zero-shot and few-shot approaches including post-hoc methods (MCM, GL-MCM), auxiliary training (CLIPN, NegPrompt), and prompt learning (LoCoOp, GalLoP). The framework is primarily conceptual, drawing connections between existing work rather than introducing new experimental methods. Reproduction would require implementing CLIP-based OOD detectors using pre-trained CLIP models on standard datasets like ImageNet-1K as ID and CIFAR-10/100 as OOD, with various prompt engineering and few-shot learning techniques.

## Key Results
- CLIP-based OOD detection redefined from distributional shift detection to detecting samples not belonging to any user-provided ID class text
- CLIP-based AD creates unified models across multiple categories, improving computational efficiency compared to category-specific approaches
- Five related fields (OD, AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection) show different activity levels in the VLM era, with some becoming inactive and others integrating
- VLMs enable practical zero-shot and few-shot detection methods that leverage vast pretraining knowledge without requiring extensive training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The introduction of the generalized OOD detection v2 framework effectively clarifies the evolving relationships between OOD detection, anomaly detection, and related fields in the VLM era by identifying inactivity and integration trends. The framework systematically reviews the evolution of five related fields using VLM adoption as a key differentiator, revealing which fields have become inactive or merged with others, thereby highlighting the primary challenges of OOD detection and AD. Core assumption: VLMs have fundamentally changed the paradigm of recognition tasks, creating new opportunities and rendering some previous approaches obsolete or redundant. Evidence: [abstract] "Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD." Break condition: If future VLMs or architectural changes create new problem spaces that don't fit the identified inactivity/integration patterns, the framework may need revision.

### Mechanism 2
The redefinition of CLIP-based OOD detection from traditional distributional shift detection to "detecting samples that do not belong to any ID class text provided by the user" enables more practical and scalable zero-shot/few-shot approaches. By shifting the definition away from distributional assumptions and toward semantic alignment with user-provided class texts, CLIP-based OOD detection leverages VLMs' vast pretraining knowledge without requiring extensive training data, enabling computationally efficient detection. Core assumption: CLIP's pretraining on massive image-text pairs provides sufficient semantic understanding to distinguish between known classes and anything outside them, regardless of distributional shifts. Evidence: [section 3.1] "CLIP-based OOD detection aims to detect samples that do not belong to any ID class text provided by the user." Break condition: If CLIP's pretraining data or semantic understanding proves insufficient for certain domains or languages, the zero-shot approach may fail.

### Mechanism 3
The evolution from traditional AD methods requiring separate models per category to unified CLIP-based AD models significantly improves computational efficiency while maintaining or improving detection accuracy. CLIP-based AD replaces category-specific models with a single unified model across multiple categories by leveraging the VLM's ability to understand and describe anomalies in natural language, eliminating the need for manual thresholds and extensive retraining. Core assumption: A single VLM can effectively learn and generalize anomaly detection patterns across diverse categories without requiring category-specific training. Evidence: [section 3.2] "CLIP-based AD creates a single unified model across multiple categories [27], [29], [35], [61], [63], which leads to a more computationally efficient approach." Break condition: If certain anomaly types prove too complex or language-dependent for the VLM to describe accurately, the unified approach may underperform category-specific models.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP and their capabilities

  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between traditional computer vision models and Vision Language Models like CLIP?

- Concept: Zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms

  - Quick check question: How do zero-shot and few-shot learning differ from traditional supervised learning approaches?

- Concept: The relationship between semantic understanding and anomaly detection
  - Why needed here: CLIP-based AD relies on the model's ability to understand and describe anomalies in natural language, which is different from traditional pattern-based anomaly detection

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Vision encoder → Visual features → Similarity computation → Text embeddings → Decision output
- Critical path: Image → Vision encoder → Visual features → Similarity computation → Text embeddings → Decision output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs few-shot: Zero-shot offers maximum scalability but may lack precision; few-shot provides better accuracy but requires some labeled data
  - Prompt engineering vs learned prompts: Manual prompts are simpler but less adaptable; learned prompts require training but can be more effective
  - Unified model vs category-specific models: Unified models are more efficient but may sacrifice some accuracy for specific categories
- Failure signatures:
  - High false positive rate: May indicate poor prompt selection or inadequate semantic understanding
  - High false negative rate: Could suggest insufficient OOD prompt coverage or model bias toward ID classes
  - Computational inefficiency: Might indicate suboptimal similarity computation or unnecessary model complexity
  - Domain shift problems: Could reveal limitations in CLIP's pretraining data coverage
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic CLIP-based zero-shot OOD detector using ImageNet as ID and CIFAR-10/100 as OOD to verify the fundamental approach works
  2. Add OOD prompts to the zero-shot detector and measure improvement in detection performance
  3. Implement a few-shot detector using LoCoOp approach and compare its performance against the zero-shot baseline on the same datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing SAM-based object-level OOD detection methods with existing approaches on relevant benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and practical applicability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How will the relationship between CLIP-based AD and medical AD evolve, and will these fields develop independently or influence each other?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the emergence of medical AD as a more challenging area than industrial AD due to larger data modality gaps, but leaves the future trajectory of these fields as an open question.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how advancements in CLIP-based AD will impact medical AD or vice versa, nor does it discuss potential challenges or opportunities for collaboration between these fields.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies analyzing the performance of CLIP-based AD methods on medical datasets, identifying domain-specific challenges and opportunities for adaptation or transfer learning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Will hard full-spectrum OOD detection effectively bridge the gap between existing FS-OOD detection and open-set domain generalization, or will it lead to further ambiguity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces hard FS-OOD detection as a potential challenge arising from the generalized OOD detection v2 framework, but acknowledges the potential for ambiguity with OSDG.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of hard FS-OOD detection in addressing the limitations of existing approaches or resolving the ambiguity with OSDG.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating hard FS-OOD detection methods against existing FS-OOD detection and OSDG approaches on relevant benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and clearer problem formulation.

## Limitations

- The framework relies heavily on identifying trends from literature review rather than empirical validation of field integration/inactivity patterns
- Many efficiency claims for CLIP-based methods lack direct comparison with traditional approaches using standardized benchmarks
- The survey is primarily conceptual, with limited experimental validation of the proposed framework's practical effectiveness

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The redefinition of CLIP-based OOD detection from distributional to semantic alignment approach (Mechanism 2)
