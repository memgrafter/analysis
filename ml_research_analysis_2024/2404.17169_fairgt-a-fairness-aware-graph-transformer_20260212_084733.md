# FairGT: A Fairness-aware Graph Transformer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.17169
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17169
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Improves fairness in graph transformers by reducing ∆SP by up to 29.02% while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Executive Summary
FairGT introduces a fairness-aware Graph Transformer architecture that addresses bias in graph neural networks by improving the independence of sensitive features during training. The method employs two key components: structural topology encoding using eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix to capture node structural information more fairly, and node feature encoding that aggregates k-hop information while preserving sensitive feature independence. Theoretical analysis proves the effectiveness of these encodings, and experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate significant fairness improvements compared to existing graph transformers and fairness-aware GNNs.

## Method Summary
FairGT is a fairness-aware Graph Transformer designed for node classification tasks that addresses bias by improving the independence of sensitive features during training. The method uses eigenvector selection from the adjacency matrix for structural topology encoding and k-hop sensitive feature complete graph for node feature encoding, integrated into a Transformer framework with multi-head attention and feed-forward networks. The architecture is evaluated on five real-world datasets with binary sensitive features, measuring both node classification accuracy and fairness through Statistical Parity (∆SP).

## Key Results
- Reduces ∆SP (Statistical Parity difference) by up to 29.02% compared to existing graph transformers
- Maintains competitive accuracy while significantly improving fairness metrics
- Outperforms existing fairness-aware GNNs and graph transformers on five real-world datasets (NBA, Bail, German, Credit, Income)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairGT addresses bias in graph transformers by improving the independence of sensitive features during training through two key mechanisms. First, it uses eigenvector selection from the adjacency matrix to capture structural topology information in a way that is more fair and less correlated with sensitive attributes. Second, it employs k-hop sensitive feature complete graph encoding that aggregates neighborhood information while explicitly preserving independence from sensitive features. This dual approach ensures that the model learns representations that are both structurally informative and fair with respect to sensitive attributes.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Graph Transformers** - Neural network architectures that apply Transformer principles to graph-structured data, using self-attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between nodes. Why needed: To handle non-Euclidean graph structures with the expressive power of Transformers. Quick check: Verify attention mechanism properly aggregates information from neighboring nodes.

2. **Statistical Parity (∆SP)** - A fairness metric measuring the difference in prediction rates between different groups defined by sensitive attributes. Why needed: To quantify and compare fairness across different models and datasets. Quick check: Calculate ∆SP for simple baseline models to establish reference values.

3. **Eigenvector decomposition of adjacency matrix** - Mathematical technique to extract structural information from graph topology by finding eigenvectors corresponding to largest eigenvalues. Why needed: To capture node structural roles in a way that can be made independent of sensitive features. Quick check: Verify eigenvectors are computed correctly and correspond to expected structural patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Adjacency Matrix -> Eigenvector Selection -> Structural Encoding -> Node Feature Encoding -> Transformer Layers -> Classification

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing → Eigenvector computation → Structural encoding → Node feature encoding → Multi-head attention → Feed-forward networks → Classification output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice of t (number of eigenvectors) and k (number of hops) represents a key tradeoff between model capacity and fairness preservation. Larger values may capture more information but risk reintroducing bias, while smaller values may be more fair but less expressive.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor fairness performance (high ∆SP) typically indicates issues with eigenvector selection or k-hop aggregation implementation. Low accuracy suggests suboptimal hyperparameter choices or insufficient model capacity to capture relevant graph patterns.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify eigenvector selection implementation by comparing computed eigenvalues/eigenvectors against known benchmarks for test graphs
2. Implement and test the sensitive feature complete graph construction and k-hop aggregation independently to confirm the mathematical formulation
3. Conduct baseline experiments comparing different numbers of eigenvectors (t) to identify the sweet spot between fairness and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unknown sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (t, k, l) across different datasets and graph structures
- Potential computational overhead from eigenvector computation and k-hop aggregation compared to standard graph transformers
- Limited evaluation to binary sensitive features, may not generalize to multi-class or continuous sensitive attributes

## Confidence
- Reproducibility of fairness improvements: Medium - significant gains reported but implementation details of fairness constraints are partially unspecified
- Theoretical guarantees: Medium-High - proofs are presented but full details are not accessible
- Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis: Low - paper does not provide systematic sensitivity studies

## Next Checks
1. Verify eigenvector selection implementation by comparing computed eigenvalues/eigenvectors against known benchmarks for test graphs
2. Implement and test the sensitive feature complete graph construction and k-hop aggregation independently to confirm the mathematical formulation
3. Conduct ablation studies varying t, k, and l parameters to identify which components contribute most to fairness improvements and establish sensitivity bounds
