# Shared Attention-based Autoencoder with Hierarchical Fusion-based Graph Convolution Network for sEEG SOZ Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12651
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12651
- Reference count: 40
- The proposed sATAE-HFGCN method achieves 80.46% accuracy, 67.31% recall, 66.04% precision, and 66.67% F1 score for SOZ identification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of identifying seizure onset zones (SOZ) in temporal lobe epilepsy using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG). The authors propose a novel approach combining a shared attention-based autoencoder (sATAE) with a hierarchical fusion-based graph convolution network (HFGCN). The sATAE captures general epilepsy features across patients while attention blocks enhance feature interdependencies, and the HFGCN integrates static and dynamic characteristics of epileptic networks through hierarchical weighting. The method is evaluated on a self-built sEEG dataset from 17 patients, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of two main components: sATAE for feature extraction and HFGCN for SOZ classification. First, sEEG data is preprocessed into power spectral features across six frequency bands, then a shared autoencoder is trained across all patients with attention blocks to capture feature interdependencies. For each patient, a graph is constructed using CCEP data to represent electrode connectivity. The HFGCN then processes these graphs using both static and dynamic convolutions with hierarchical fusion to integrate stable network topology with time-varying functional connectivity patterns. The final output is SOZ classification probabilities for each contact site.

## Key Results
- The sATAE-HFGCN method achieves 80.46% accuracy, 67.31% recall, 66.04% precision, and 66.67% F1 score
- Superior performance compared to existing methods on the same dataset
- Attention blocks and hierarchical fusion contribute to improved feature representation and classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shared attention-based autoencoder (sATAE) captures general epilepsy features across patients by training on pooled sEEG data
- Mechanism: By training a single autoencoder across all patients rather than individual patient-specific models, sATAE learns common patterns of epileptic activity that generalize across subjects
- Core assumption: Epileptic neural activity contains shared patterns across patients despite individual anatomical differences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "sATAE is trained by sEEG data across all patients, with attention blocks introduced to enhance the representation of interdependencies between feature elements"
  - [section II.A]: "The advantage of using an autoencoder lies in its ability to capture complex patterns within a large amount of data"
  - [corpus]: Found related work using graph convolutional variational autoencoders for EEG subject representation learning
- Break condition: If inter-patient variability in epileptic patterns is too high, shared training would obscure patient-specific SOZ features

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical fusion-based graph convolution network (HFGCN) integrates static and dynamic brain network characteristics to improve SOZ identification
- Mechanism: Static convolutions capture stable network topology while dynamic convolutions capture time-varying synchronization patterns, with hierarchical weighting fusing information across layers
- Core assumption: Epileptic networks exhibit both stable structural connections and dynamic functional connectivity that must be modeled jointly
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "HFGCN integrates the dynamic and static characteristics of epileptic networks through hierarchical weighting across different hierarchies"
  - [section III.B.3]: "HFGCN leverages both dynamic and static convolutions to model the intricate coexistence patterns of dynamic and static components within epileptic network"
  - [corpus]: Found work on dynamic graph learning networks for autism spectrum disorder that similarly integrates temporal dynamics
- Break condition: If dynamic fluctuations are too noisy or irrelevant to SOZ localization, the additional complexity may degrade performance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Attention blocks in sATAE improve feature representation by weighting feature interdependencies
- Mechanism: Attention blocks compute element-wise importance scores that modulate feature interactions, allowing the model to focus on diagnostically relevant feature combinations
- Core assumption: Not all feature element interactions are equally informative for SOZ identification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "sATAE...with attention blocks introduced to enhance the representation of interdependencies between feature elements"
  - [section III.B.1]: "The attention block connects the input and output of every two fully connected layers...to capture the different importance of feature elements"
  - [corpus]: Found work on attention-based multiscale temporal fusion for fault diagnosis, suggesting attention mechanisms are valuable for complex biomedical signal analysis
- Break condition: If attention weights become uniform or the attention mechanism overfits to training data

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: sEEG contact sites have spatial relationships that form a graph structure; GCNs can leverage these connections for better feature learning
  - Quick check question: How does a graph convolution operation differ from a standard convolution in CNN?

- Autoencoder Architecture
  - Why needed here: sATAE must learn compressed representations of high-dimensional sEEG features while preserving diagnostic information
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the bottleneck layer in an autoencoder?

- Frequency Band Analysis
  - Why needed here: Different EEG frequency bands contain distinct epileptic information; understanding their characteristics is crucial for feature extraction
  - Quick check question: Which frequency band is most commonly associated with epileptic spike detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  sEEG preprocessing -> Feature extraction (sATAE) -> Graph construction -> SOZ classification (HFGCN) -> Output probabilities

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess sEEG data into power spectral features across 6 frequency bands and calculate power spectra
  2. Train sATAE across all patients to extract latent representations with attention blocks
  3. Construct patient-specific graphs using CCEP data for adjacency matrices
  4. Apply HFGCN with static and dynamic convolutions plus hierarchical fusion
  5. Output SOZ classification probabilities for each contact site

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared vs. patient-specific autoencoders: Trade generalization for specificity
  - Static vs. dynamic convolutions: Balance stable topology with temporal dynamics
  - Attention vs. standard convolutions: Increased representational power vs. computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-smoothing in GCN layers (features becoming too similar)
  - Attention weights becoming uniform (losing discriminative power)
  - Poor generalization across patients (overfitting to training set)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Train without attention blocks to quantify their contribution
  2. Ablation: Use only static convolutions in HFGCN to test necessity of dynamic modeling
  3. Ablation: Train patient-specific autoencoders instead of shared model to evaluate generalization benefit

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on sEEG datasets from other epilepsy types beyond temporal lobe epilepsy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they evaluated their method on a self-built sEEG dataset from 17 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, but do not mention testing on other epilepsy types.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not report results or analysis for other epilepsy types, limiting generalizability assessment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the sATAE-HFGCN method on sEEG datasets from focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, or other specific epilepsy syndromes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of behavioral states used as input on SOZ identification performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper investigates combinations of behavioral states (wake, sleep, seizure) but does not explore using fewer than three or more than three states.
- Why unresolved: The analysis is limited to specific combinations, leaving uncertainty about optimal number of states.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of performance using 1, 2, 3, and potentially 4+ behavioral states.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of sATAE-HFGCN compare to expert human annotation in SOZ identification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that SOZ contact sites were determined collaboratively by eight epilepsy neurosurgeons, but do not compare automated method performance to human expert performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks a direct comparison between the automated method and human expert annotation accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison of sATAE-HFGCN results versus consensus expert annotation on the same dataset.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (17 patients) limits generalizability and raises overfitting concerns
- No comparison with state-of-the-art seizure detection methods to assess relative performance
- Lack of cross-validation details and statistical significance testing reduces confidence in reported metrics

## Confidence
- sATAE feature learning effectiveness: Medium - While the architecture is sound, the small dataset size limits validation of generalization claims
- HFGCN integration of static/dynamic features: Medium - The hierarchical fusion approach is well-motivated but not thoroughly validated through ablation studies
- Overall method superiority: Low - No comparisons to existing state-of-the-art methods, making superiority claims unsupported

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing attention blocks, static convolutions, and dynamic convolutions separately to quantify each component's contribution
2. Perform cross-validation with statistical significance testing to validate robustness across different patient subsets
3. Compare performance against established SOZ identification methods on the same dataset to establish relative effectiveness
