# Beyond Generative Artificial Intelligence: Roadmap for Natural Language Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10554
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic analysis of NLG research gaps identifies five key areas for future work: multimodality, multilinguality, knowledge integration, explainability, and ethical concerns

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a roadmap for future research in Natural Language Generation (NLG) by analyzing current challenges and identifying key research gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors reviewed 16 recent NLG surveys to determine areas requiring improvement, including multimodality, multilinguality, knowledge integration, controllable generation, and hallucination. They tested GPT-4 and Bard to validate these gaps, finding issues with multimodal processing, language support beyond English, commonsense knowledge, controlled generation, and factual accuracy. The roadmap proposes five key areas for future research: addressing multimodality and multilinguality challenges, improving knowledge integration and controllable generation, mitigating hallucination, enhancing explainability, and addressing ethical concerns in LLM development.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic meta-analysis of 16 recent NLG surveys to identify common research gaps and limitations. They validated these findings through direct interaction tests with GPT-4 and Bard, examining performance across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, multilingual capabilities (testing Spanish and Valencian), commonsense knowledge integration, controllable generation, and hallucination. The methodology combined literature review with empirical validation to create a comprehensive research roadmap for NLG advancement.

## Key Results
- Multimodality remains a significant challenge, with current LLMs struggling to process and integrate information from different modalities equally
- Language support beyond English is limited, with models showing difficulties with linguistic variants and non-English semantics
- Hallucination and factual accuracy present ongoing challenges, with models generating untrustworthy or illogical text despite fluent surface form

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using recent NLG survey review reveals current LLM limitations across multiple dimensions (multimodality, multilinguality, knowledge integration, controllability, hallucination)
- Mechanism: Systematic meta-analysis of 16 recent NLG surveys identifies common gaps; validation with GPT-4 and Bard confirms these gaps in practice
- Core assumption: Recent surveys comprehensively capture the current state of NLG and LLM performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By doing so, we aim to provide the scientific community with a research roadmap to identify which NLG aspects are still not suitably addressed by LLMs"
  - [section] "Table 1 gathers data on the year the survey was published, and whether the survey includes the following: corpora, methods, and tools"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related papers but none directly replicate this methodology
- Break condition: If surveyed papers miss significant emerging NLG approaches or LLM capabilities, the roadmap becomes outdated quickly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Testing GPT-4 and Bard in non-English languages (Spanish, Valencian) exposes multilingual limitations
- Mechanism: Direct interaction tests reveal models struggle with linguistic variants and non-English semantics
- Core assumption: Simple conversational prompts can reveal systematic model limitations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We did this test in the Spanish version of both chatbots, but GPT-4 first answered in English, whereas Bard directly answered in Spanish"
  - [section] "GPT-4 and Bard tend to get confused with Catalan variants when it comes to the verb ending"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related work on multilingual NLG but not this specific validation approach
- Break condition: If models improve multilingual capabilities significantly, these specific test cases become less diagnostic

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Identifying ethical concerns and explainability as research gaps creates forward-looking roadmap
- Mechanism: Analysis extends beyond technical capabilities to societal impact considerations
- Core assumption: Ethical and explainability concerns will shape NLG research priorities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "LLMs can be a powerful tool to help humans in their daily life activities when used responsibly. However, given the large scale these models have acquired with their latest developments, several ethical considerations have emerged"
  - [section] "Deep neural models, such as LLMs, have improved the effectiveness of NLG. Notwithstanding, these techniques have led indirectly to another social concern, which is explainability"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related work on AI ethics but not specifically tied to NLG roadmap methodology
- Break condition: If ethical guidelines become standardized and explainability techniques mature rapidly, this becomes less of a research gap

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Systematic literature review methodology
  - Why needed here: Enables comprehensive gap identification across multiple NLG dimensions
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between systematic and narrative literature reviews?

- Concept: Large Language Model capabilities and limitations
  - Why needed here: Understanding LLM performance boundaries is essential for identifying research gaps
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between GPT-3, GPT-4, and BERT?

- Concept: Multilingual NLP challenges
  - Why needed here: Identifies why low-resource languages present unique NLG challenges
  - Quick check question: How does the availability of training data differ between English and low-resource languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Survey analysis engine → Gap identification module → LLM validation interface → Roadmap synthesis component
- Critical path: Survey collection → Gap analysis → LLM testing → Roadmap generation
- Design tradeoffs: Breadth vs. depth in survey selection; English-centric validation vs. multilingual testing
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent gap identification across surveys; LLM tests not reproducing identified gaps
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate survey gap analysis with 5 additional recent NLG surveys
  2. Test identified gaps with three different LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
  3. Implement automated multilingual gap testing framework for 10 languages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific architectural and algorithmic innovations required to achieve true multimodal understanding in NLG systems, where different modalities (text, images, audio, etc.) are processed with equal importance and seamlessly integrated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that multimodality is a key research gap, noting that current systems tend to prioritize one modality over another and lack balance in knowledge acquisition from different input types.
- Why unresolved: Current NLG systems show limitations in processing and integrating information from multiple modalities equally. They often struggle to achieve a balanced representation of knowledge across different input formats, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring multimodal understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating NLG architectures that demonstrate improved performance in multimodal tasks, with clear evidence of balanced processing and integration of information from different modalities. This could include benchmarks showing superior performance in tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, or multimodal machine translation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can NLG systems be developed to effectively support a wider range of languages, particularly low-resource languages, while preserving linguistic nuances and avoiding bias introduced through reliance on English as a pivot language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights multilinguality as a critical research gap, noting the predominance of English in NLG research and the lack of original datasets for many languages, especially low-resource ones. It also mentions the risk of missing semantic properties inherent to each language when using English as a pivot.
- Why unresolved: Current NLG research and datasets heavily favor English, creating a bias in model development and evaluation. This leads to suboptimal performance for non-English languages and potentially excludes speakers of low-resource languages from benefiting from NLG advancements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating NLG systems that achieve comparable performance across a diverse set of languages, including low-resource ones, without relying on English as a pivot. This could involve creating and evaluating models on language-specific datasets and showing improvements in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering for various languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What methods can be developed to effectively integrate external knowledge and commonsense reasoning into NLG systems, enabling them to generate more factually accurate and contextually appropriate text, while also addressing the challenges of hallucination and bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies knowledge integration and controllable NLG as key research gaps, noting the limited degree of commonsense in current LLMs and their tendency to generate untrustworthy or illogical text. It also mentions the challenge of hallucination and the need for methods to reduce its occurrence.
- Why unresolved: Current NLG systems, despite their impressive capabilities, often lack the ability to reason about the world and incorporate external knowledge effectively. This leads to issues like hallucination, where generated text may seem fluent but contains factual inaccuracies or illogical content. Additionally, biases present in training data can be amplified in generated text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating NLG architectures that demonstrate improved performance in tasks requiring factual accuracy and commonsense reasoning. This could include benchmarks showing reduced hallucination rates, improved performance in knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering and fact checking, and evidence of reduced bias in generated text.

## Limitations

- The survey sample of 16 papers may not fully represent the rapidly evolving NLG landscape, potentially missing emerging approaches and capabilities
- Limited validation testing with only GPT-4 and Bard may not capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities and limitations across different architectures
- The roadmap's predictions about research priorities and timelines may become outdated quickly as LLM capabilities advance rapidly

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The identification of multimodality, multilinguality, and hallucination as persistent challenges in LLMs - these findings align with multiple recent studies and community consensus
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific ranking of research gaps and their relative importance, as this depends on survey selection criteria and may shift with new developments
- **Low Confidence:** The roadmap's temporal predictions about when these gaps might be addressed, given the unpredictable pace of LLM advancement

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the survey analysis with an expanded corpus of 20+ recent NLG surveys to test the stability of identified research gaps
2. Conduct systematic testing of the identified gaps using five different LLM architectures across multiple language pairs and multimodal inputs
3. Perform a longitudinal study tracking how the identified gaps evolve over a 12-month period as new model versions are released
