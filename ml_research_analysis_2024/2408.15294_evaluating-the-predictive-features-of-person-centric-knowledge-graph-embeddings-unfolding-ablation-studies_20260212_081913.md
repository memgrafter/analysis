## Executive Summary
This study presents a systematic ablation approach to identify predictive features in person-centric knowledge graph embeddings for ICU readmission prediction using the MIMIC-III dataset. The method evaluates Graph Neural Network models by systematically removing demographic, social, and clinical features to assess their impact on model performance. Results show that demographic information, particularly marital status and race, are significant predictors, while age was less influential despite a predominantly elderly patient population. Social determinants, even with substantial missing data, significantly impact model performance, especially household information. Clinical factors, including diseases and medications, emerged as key drivers, with model performance degrading notably when clinical information was excluded.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Graph Neural Networks (specifically PKGSage1 with SAGE Graph Convolution Network architecture) to learn embeddings from person-centric knowledge graphs constructed from MIMIC-III data. The framework systematically removes feature groups (demographic, social context, clinical) through ablation studies and measures the impact on readmission prediction performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics. The method demonstrates robustness to missing data by showing minimal performance degradation when individual features are excluded, with worst-case accuracy and F1 score decreases of 4.13% and 1.75% respectively.

## Key Results
- Demographic features, particularly marital status and race, emerge as significant predictors of ICU readmission
- Social determinants significantly impact model performance despite 77.9% missing data for household information
- Clinical factors including diseases and medications are key drivers, with performance degrading notably when clinical information is excluded
- Models demonstrate robustness to missing data, showing minimal performance degradation when individual features are removed
- Age was less influential as a predictor despite 56.24% of patients being over 70 years old

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Ablation studies systematically identify which features drive model performance by measuring performance drop when features are removed. The method removes one feature group (demographics, social context, clinical) at a time and observes accuracy/F1 score changes to quantify importance. Core assumption: Feature groups are sufficiently independent that removing one doesn't cause cascading effects that confound the measurement.

### Mechanism 2
Graph Neural Networks can learn meaningful representations from heterogeneous biomedical data by encoding entity relationships in PKGs. The GNN processes the person-centric knowledge graph where nodes represent entities (diseases, medications, demographics) and edges represent relationships, learning embeddings that capture both local and global structural information. Core assumption: The graph structure adequately represents the relationships between clinical, demographic, and social features relevant to readmission prediction.

### Mechanism 3
The framework demonstrates robustness to missing data by showing minimal performance degradation when individual features are excluded. The ablation study reveals that models maintain relatively stable performance (accuracy/F1 drops ≤4.13% and ≤1.75% respectively) even when significant portions of data are removed. Core assumption: The model's architecture and training process can handle incomplete information without catastrophic failure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graph Embeddings**: Understanding how entities and relationships are represented as vectors is fundamental to grasping how PKGs work. Quick check: What is the difference between node embeddings and edge embeddings in a knowledge graph?

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: The entire approach relies on GNNs to learn representations from PKGs, so understanding their operation is critical. Quick check: How does message passing in GNNs differ from traditional neural network layers?

- **Ablation Studies**: This is the core methodology for feature importance analysis in the paper. Quick check: What's the difference between ablation studies and feature importance methods like SHAP or LIME?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data extraction layer (MIMIC-III dataset → patient admissions) → Graph construction layer (ontology-driven PKG creation) → GNN model layer (PKGSage1 SAGE Graph Convolution Network) → Evaluation layer (ablation studies + performance metrics) → Analysis layer (feature importance interpretation)

- **Critical path**: Data extraction → Graph construction → GNN training → Ablation study → Feature analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**: Directed vs undirected graph (V1 directed vs V3 undirected showed similar performance, but directed edges preserve semantic relationships); Missing data handling (trades potential accuracy gains from complete data for robustness to real-world data gaps); Computational cost (ablation studies require training multiple model variants, increasing experimentation time)

- **Failure signatures**: Performance plateaus or degrades when removing any feature group (indicates all features are equally important or model overfits); Large variance in ablation results across runs (indicates instability in the GNN training); Missing data disproportionately affects certain patient subgroups (indicates bias in the approach)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run ablation study removing only demographic features to verify marital status and race importance; 2) Remove social context features (household information) to confirm impact despite high missing rate; 3) Remove clinical features in combinations (diseases only, medications only, procedures only) to understand intercorrelations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the performance of models change when including social determinants of health data that has been systematically collected and standardized rather than extracted from unstructured clinical notes? The paper notes that social determinants data had significant missing data (77.9% for household information) and that robust data collection strategies are needed for enhancing data-driven understanding of readmission prediction.

- **Open Question 2**: What is the relative importance of additional diagnoses beyond the most common readmission-associated conditions in predicting ICU readmissions? The paper found that excluding all disease information led to greater performance degradation than excluding only the most common readmission diagnoses, suggesting additional diagnoses play a substantial role.

- **Open Question 3**: How do demographic predictors of readmission differ across age groups within the MIMIC-III dataset, given that 56.24% of patients are over 70 years old? The paper notes that age was not the strongest predictor despite a predominantly elderly patient population, suggesting that demographic factors may have different predictive power across age groups.

## Limitations
- Absence of detailed implementation specifications for PKGSage1 architecture and preprocessing steps
- Ablation study assumes feature independence which may not hold for correlated healthcare features
- Robustness claims may not generalize to datasets with different missing data patterns

## Confidence
- Feature importance findings (demographic → social → clinical hierarchy): **Medium** - Results are consistent across multiple ablation runs but could be influenced by feature correlations
- Robustness to missing data: **High** - Quantitative evidence shows minimal performance degradation (<4.13% accuracy drop) across multiple ablation scenarios
- Graph Neural Network effectiveness: **Medium** - While GNNs are well-established, the specific PKG representation's effectiveness depends on graph construction quality

## Next Checks
1. Perform feature correlation analysis before ablation to verify the independence assumption and understand potential confounding effects
2. Test the ablation framework on a different healthcare dataset (e.g., eICU or another hospital system) to assess generalizability
3. Implement temporal ablation by removing features from different time windows to understand temporal feature importance in readmission prediction
