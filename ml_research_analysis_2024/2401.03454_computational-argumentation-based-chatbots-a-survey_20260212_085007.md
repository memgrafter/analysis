# Computational Argumentation-based Chatbots: a Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.03454
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03454
- Reference count: 40
- Only around 9 computational argumentation-based chatbots identified in literature

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews chatbots that incorporate computational argumentation frameworks, finding remarkably few such systems in the existing literature. The authors categorize identified chatbots based on their argumentation usage: for extraction, reply structuring, reasoning, or delivery. Most systems focus on persuasion and explanation tasks, typically employing bipolar argumentation frameworks and retrieval-based architectures. The paper argues that while computational argumentation is theoretically well-suited for natural language interactions, its integration with modern large language models remains largely unexplored, representing a significant research gap.

## Method Summary
The survey conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify chatbots utilizing computational argumentation techniques. The authors systematically categorized identified systems based on their primary use of argumentation - whether for argument extraction from user input, structuring chatbot replies, supporting reasoning processes, or delivering arguments to users. Each system was analyzed for its underlying architecture, argumentation framework (primarily bipolar frameworks), and application domain, with particular attention to persuasion and explanation tasks.

## Key Results
- Only around 9 argumentation-based chatbots found in literature
- Most systems use bipolar argumentation frameworks and retrieval-based architectures
- Focus primarily on persuasion and explanation tasks
- Integration with modern LLMs remains largely unexplored

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Computational argumentation provides structured reasoning frameworks that can enhance chatbot capabilities in handling complex dialogues, particularly for tasks requiring justification, explanation, or persuasion. By incorporating argumentation frameworks, chatbots can better manage conflicting information, provide transparent reasoning paths, and construct more coherent responses that acknowledge multiple perspectives. This structured approach helps address fundamental limitations of traditional chatbots in handling nuanced conversations.

## Foundational Learning
- Computational argumentation frameworks - Needed to understand how logical structures can be applied to dialogue; Quick check: Review bipolar argumentation theory basics
- Retrieval-based architectures - Essential for understanding how responses are selected and generated; Quick check: Compare retrieval vs generative approaches
- Persuasion and explanation tasks - Critical context for application domain; Quick check: Analyze examples of argumentative dialogue
- LLM limitations (hallucination, bias, transparency) - Provides motivation for argumentation integration; Quick check: Review documented LLM failure modes
- Natural language interaction patterns - Understanding how humans argue informs system design; Quick check: Study conversational argumentation examples

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User Input -> Argument Extraction -> Reasoning Engine -> Response Generation -> Chatbot Output
Critical path: User query → Argument extraction → Framework reasoning → Structured response → Delivery
Design tradeoffs: Retrieval-based vs generative architectures; simplicity vs comprehensiveness in argumentation frameworks
Failure signatures: Circular reasoning, inconsistent argumentation, inability to handle novel argument types
First experiments: 1) Implement basic bipolar argumentation framework; 2) Test argument extraction from sample dialogues; 3) Evaluate response quality against standard chatbots

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several key open questions: How can computational argumentation be effectively integrated with modern LLMs? What are the practical benefits of argumentation-enhanced chatbots in real-world applications? How can argumentation frameworks address fundamental LLM limitations like hallucination and bias? What performance trade-offs exist when incorporating argumentation into chatbot architectures?

## Limitations
- Small number of identified systems raises questions about survey completeness
- Claims about argumentation suitability lack empirical validation
- Integration with LLMs remains speculative without concrete implementations
- Focus on specific domains may miss broader applications

## Confidence
- Survey completeness: Medium (methodology not fully detailed)
- Argumentation suitability claims: Low (theoretical only)
- LLM integration benefits: Medium (speculative without evidence)
- System categorization accuracy: High (based on clear criteria)

## Next Checks
1) Conduct systematic search of additional databases to verify completeness of system inventory
2) Implement prototype integrating argumentation frameworks with modern LLM to test transparency and bias claims
3) Perform user studies comparing argumentation-enhanced chatbots against standard LLMs in explanation and persuasion tasks
