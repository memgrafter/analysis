# Leveraging Large Language Models for Concept Graph Recovery and Question Answering in NLP Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14293
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14293
- Reference count: 15
- LLMs achieve up to 26% F1 score enhancement on TutorQA tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using Large Language Models for concept graph recovery and question answering in educational contexts, focusing on NLP. It introduces CGPrompt, a zero-shot method for recovering domain-specific concept graphs using LLMs, and TutorQA, a benchmark with 500 expert-verified QA pairs across five tasks. The study also presents CGLLM, a pipeline integrating concept graphs with LLMs to enhance performance on TutorQA tasks. Results show that GPT-4 zero-shot concept graph recovery is competitive with supervised methods, with an average 3% F1 score improvement. On TutorQA tasks, LLMs achieve up to 26% F1 score enhancement, with CGLLM generating answers with more fine-grained concepts.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes CGPrompt for zero-shot concept graph recovery, using directional prerequisite relation prompts with binary YES/NO outputs. For question answering, it introduces CGLLM, a pipeline that generates Cypher queries to retrieve concept paths from the graph, then uses these paths as context for answer generation. The approach is evaluated on TutorQA, a benchmark with 500 expert-verified QA pairs across five tasks in NLP. Evaluation uses Accuracy/F1 for binary tasks, similarity-based F1 (S-F1) for concept lists, and human evaluation for open-ended tasks.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 zero-shot concept graph recovery achieves competitive performance with supervised methods, showing an average 3% F1 score improvement
- CGLLM integration leads to consistent increases in concept identification, particularly notable in GPT-4, which improves from 5.24 to 19.92 concepts
- Human evaluation confirms the model's ability to produce scientifically accurate and relevant project proposals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Zero-shot concept graph recovery with LLMs can be competitive with supervised methods when given a well-structured prompt that clarifies the directionality and purpose of the edge prediction. The CGPrompt defines a directional prerequisite relation and instructs the LLM to output only "YES" or "NO" for each concept pair, reducing ambiguity and allowing the LLM to focus on causal understanding of prerequisite chains.

### Mechanism 2
Integrating a recovered concept graph with LLMs (via CGLLM) improves QA performance by grounding answers in known prerequisite paths rather than generating from scratch. CGLLM uses one LLM to generate Cypher queries to retrieve concept paths from the graph, then feeds those paths as context to a second LLM for answer generation, reducing hallucination and increasing factual grounding.

### Mechanism 3
Similarity-based F1 (S-F1) is more appropriate than exact keyword matching for evaluating LLM-generated concept lists because LLMs often generate semantically similar but lexically different concepts. For each predicted concept, cosine similarity to ground truth concepts is computed; matches above a threshold (0.6) are counted, enabling precision and recall to reflect semantic overlap rather than token overlap.

## Foundational Learning

- **Prerequisite relation modeling in educational graphs**: Why needed here - The core task is to recover directed edges representing "A is prerequisite for B." Understanding this modeling guides prompt design and evaluation. Quick check question: If concept A is "Linear Algebra" and concept B is "Vector Representations," should the relation be A→B or B→A in an NLP curriculum graph?

- **Zero-shot prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Why needed here - These are the primary strategies compared for concept graph recovery; knowing their mechanics explains why CoT sometimes underperforms. Quick check question: In a CoT prompt for concept pairs, what extra reasoning step is typically inserted compared to a zero-shot prompt?

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration**: Why needed here - RAG is tested as an enhancement to concept graph recovery, so understanding how external documents are retrieved and injected into the prompt is key to interpreting its mixed results. Quick check question: In the RAG setup, what is the role of the external corpus (e.g., TutorialBank) relative to the LLM's internal knowledge?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CGPrompt -> Graph Builder -> CGLLM Pipeline -> Evaluator
- **Critical path**: Prompt → LLM prediction → Graph construction → Query generation → Answer generation → Evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-shot prompts avoid annotation cost but may be less accurate than supervised; graph grounding improves answer quality but adds latency and dependency on graph quality
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Low Accuracy/F1 → prompt ambiguity or LLM domain gap
  - Sparse graph edges → overly conservative predictions
  - Human eval low scores → hallucinated or irrelevant answers despite graph grounding
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run CGPrompt zero-shot on a small concept subset; compute Accuracy/F1
  2. Generate concept paths for TutorQA Q2; compare GPT4 vs GPT4-CGLLM S-F1 scores
  3. Test CGPrompt with and without RAG on NLP domain; measure any F1 change

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of CGPrompt compare to supervised methods when applied to concept graphs in domains outside of NLP, such as Computer Vision or Bioinformatics? The paper focuses primarily on the NLP domain and provides limited analysis for other domains.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of different prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG), on the performance of concept graph recovery across different domains? The paper mentions that CoT and RAG are explored but results indicate that CoT does not improve performance and RAG does not consistently yield improvements.

### Open Question 3
How does the integration of external data sources, such as Wikipedia or domain-specific corpora, affect the performance of concept graph recovery using LLMs? The paper mentions that incorporating Wikipedia content improves performance while using LectureBankCD documents diminishes performance, but does not provide detailed analysis.

### Open Question 4
How does the performance of CGLLM vary across different types of questions in the TutorQA benchmark, and what factors contribute to the observed differences? The paper mentions that CGLLM enhances performance on TutorQA tasks but does not provide detailed analysis of performance variations across different question types.

### Open Question 5
How does the concept graph generated by LLMs compare to manually curated concept graphs in terms of accuracy, coverage, and usefulness for educational applications? The paper mentions that LLMs can generate concept graphs but does not provide a direct comparison with manually curated concept graphs.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is constrained to the NLP domain with a fixed concept set, limiting claims about cross-domain applicability
- Human evaluation sample size for project proposals (50 questions) is relatively small
- RAG integration shows inconsistent results, suggesting that external document retrieval may not always enhance LLM performance when internal knowledge is sufficient

## Confidence

- **High**: Zero-shot concept graph recovery effectiveness compared to supervised methods
- **Medium**: CGLLM pipeline's ability to improve answer quality through graph grounding
- **Low**: Claims about semantic evaluation metrics (S-F1) without corpus validation

## Next Checks
1. Test CGPrompt on multiple educational domains beyond NLP to assess cross-domain generalization of zero-shot concept graph recovery.
2. Conduct larger-scale human evaluations across all five TutorQA task types to validate automated metric findings.
3. Compare S-F1 evaluation against alternative semantic matching approaches to verify its superiority for concept list assessment.
