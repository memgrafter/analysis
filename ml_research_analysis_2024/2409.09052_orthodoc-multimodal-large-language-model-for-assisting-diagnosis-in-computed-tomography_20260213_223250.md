# OrthoDoc: Multimodal Large Language Model for Assisting Diagnosis in Computed Tomography

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.09052
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09052
- Authors: Youzhu Jin; Yichen Zhang
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: OrthoDoc achieves over 91% accuracy in diagnosing common orthopedic conditions using a multimodal approach integrating CT images and diagnostic reports

## Executive Summary
OrthoDoc is a multimodal large language model designed to assist in orthopedic diagnosis using computed tomography (CT) scans. The system integrates 120,000 CT images with diagnostic reports and employs advanced techniques including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for structured reasoning. In extensive experiments, OrthoDoc outperforms commercial models like GPT-4, demonstrating high accuracy in diagnosing common conditions such as fractures, arthritis, and tumors while showing strong generalization capabilities for rare and complex cases.

## Method Summary
OrthoDoc employs a two-phase specialization process that combines multimodal fine-tuning with specialized modules for medical diagnostics. The model is trained on 120,000 CT image-text pairs, using ResNet-101 for image feature extraction and BERT for text embeddings. A cross-modal attention mechanism integrates visual and textual data, while the RAG module retrieves relevant medical knowledge to ground text generation. The CoT techniques structure the reasoning process for generating coherent diagnostic reports. An automated LaTeX pipeline formats the final reports for clinical use.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 91% accuracy in diagnosing common orthopedic conditions including fractures, arthritis, and tumors
- Demonstrates strong generalization and stability when handling rare and complex cases
- Outperforms commercial models like GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy and report quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: OrthoDoc's integration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module effectively mitigates hallucinations by grounding text generation in verified medical literature.
- Mechanism: The RAG module retrieves relevant information from a curated medical knowledge base before generating text, ensuring outputs are aligned with established medical knowledge.
- Core assumption: The RAG module has access to accurate and comprehensive medical texts that cover the necessary diagnostic information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This module is informed by extensive medical literature, textbooks, and explanatory data."
  - [section]: "OrthoDoc employs a comprehensive multimodal approach by integrating 120,000 CT images with corresponding diagnostic reports."
  - [corpus]: Found related papers on medical imaging and multimodal models, but no direct evidence of RAG effectiveness in reducing hallucinations in medical contexts.
- Break condition: If the retrieved information is outdated, incomplete, or irrelevant, the RAG module cannot effectively prevent hallucinations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques enable structured reasoning, leading to more coherent and comprehensive diagnostic reports.
- Mechanism: CoT guides the model through step-by-step reasoning, ensuring that each part of the diagnostic report logically follows from the previous sections.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively parse and utilize the structured reasoning provided by the CoT techniques.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It also incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques for structured reasoning."
  - [section]: "CoT allows the model to produce detailed and coherent long-form text reports by structuring its reasoning process effectively."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in the corpus; this is based on the paper's claims.
- Break condition: If the CoT techniques are not properly integrated or the model cannot follow the structured reasoning, the quality of diagnostic reports may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multimodal fine-tuning using 120,000 CT images and diagnostic reports enhances the model's ability to accurately interpret medical images and generate precise diagnostic reports.
- Mechanism: By training on a large and diverse dataset, the model learns to correlate visual features in CT images with textual descriptions, improving diagnostic accuracy.
- Core assumption: The dataset is representative and sufficiently large to cover a wide range of orthopedic conditions and imaging variations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "OrthoDoc is trained on 120,000 CT images and diagnostic reports."
  - [section]: "The first stage focuses on multimodal training using a dataset of 120,000 CT images paired with detailed diagnostic reports."
  - [corpus]: Related papers mention large datasets and multimodal approaches but do not provide direct evidence of OrthoDoc's dataset size or effectiveness.
- Break condition: If the dataset is not diverse enough or contains biases, the model's performance may degrade, especially in handling rare or complex cases.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: To enable the model to process and integrate information from both CT images and textual diagnostic reports.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how multimodal learning differs from single-modal learning in the context of medical diagnostics?
- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: To reduce hallucinations by grounding the model's text generation in verified medical literature.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the retrieval component in a RAG system, and how does it prevent hallucinations?
- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: To structure the reasoning process, leading to more coherent and comprehensive diagnostic reports.
  - Quick check question: How does CoT improve the logical flow of generated text compared to standard text generation techniques?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ResNet-101 -> BERT -> Cross-modal attention -> RAG module -> CoT module -> Automated LaTeX pipeline
- Critical path:
  1. Extract image features using ResNet-101
  2. Generate text embeddings using BERT
  3. Integrate features through cross-modal attention
  4. Retrieve relevant medical information via RAG
  5. Generate diagnostic report using CoT
  6. Format report using LaTeX pipeline
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger datasets improve model performance but increase training time and computational resources.
  - RAG reduces hallucinations but may slow down text generation due to retrieval overhead.
  - CoT improves report coherence but adds complexity to the model architecture.
- Failure signatures:
  - High hallucination rates indicate RAG module issues.
  - Inconsistent or incomplete reports suggest CoT module problems.
  - Poor image interpretation may point to issues in the multimodal integration or feature extraction.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test RAG module effectiveness by comparing hallucination rates with and without RAG on a set of medical queries.
  2. Evaluate CoT module by analyzing the coherence and completeness of generated reports against expert reviews.
  3. Assess multimodal integration by testing the model's ability to correctly correlate image features with textual descriptions in a diagnostic task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does OrthoDoc perform in diagnosing orthopedic conditions beyond fractures, arthritis, and tumors, such as congenital deformities or metabolic bone diseases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that OrthoDoc is trained on a diverse dataset covering a wide range of conditions but does not provide specific performance metrics for conditions beyond the three mentioned.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the performance of OrthoDoc in diagnosing common orthopedic conditions (fractures, arthritis, and tumors) but does not elaborate on its effectiveness in diagnosing other orthopedic conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing OrthoDoc's diagnostic accuracy for a broader range of orthopedic conditions, including congenital deformities and metabolic bone diseases, would provide clarity on its generalization capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction rates when OrthoDoc is integrated into routine clinical practice?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses OrthoDoc's potential for clinical applications and its ability to provide detailed diagnostic information and treatment recommendations, but does not address long-term outcomes or patient satisfaction.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the model's diagnostic accuracy and performance in controlled experiments but does not explore its impact on long-term patient outcomes or satisfaction in real-world clinical settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking patient outcomes and satisfaction rates over time when OrthoDoc is used in clinical practice would provide insights into its real-world effectiveness and patient impact.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does OrthoDoc handle the integration of additional imaging modalities, such as MRI or ultrasound, in its diagnostic process?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions OrthoDoc's capability to process complex CT images but does not discuss its performance with other imaging modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on CT image diagnostics and does not explore how the model performs when integrating other types of medical imaging data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating OrthoDoc's diagnostic accuracy and performance when incorporating MRI or ultrasound data would clarify its versatility across different imaging modalities.

## Limitations
- The model's effectiveness in diagnosing conditions beyond the three common types (fractures, arthritis, tumors) is not fully evaluated
- Long-term clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction when integrated into routine practice remain unknown
- Performance with additional imaging modalities like MRI or ultrasound has not been tested

## Confidence
- Confidence level: Medium
  - The 91% accuracy claim is based on internal testing but lacks detailed methodology disclosure
  - RAG module effectiveness depends on unspecified medical literature comprehensiveness
  - CoT benefits are asserted without empirical ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an independent evaluation comparing OrthoDoc's diagnostic accuracy against expert radiologists on a held-out test set of CT images spanning common to rare orthopedic conditions.

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the RAG and CoT modules to overall model performance, particularly focusing on hallucination reduction and report coherence.

3. Test the model's robustness by evaluating its performance on CT images with varying quality levels and artifacts commonly found in clinical settings.
