# p-Mean Regret for Stochastic Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.10751
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10751
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces p-mean regret as flexible metric balancing fairness and efficiency

## Executive Summary
This work introduces p-mean regret as a flexible metric for evaluating stochastic bandit algorithms, where p parameterizes the trade-off between fairness (worst-case arm performance) and efficiency (overall performance). The authors propose a unified Explore-Then-UCB algorithm combining uniform exploration with UCB1, which under mild assumptions achieves optimal p-mean regret bounds across different p ranges: Õ(k^{1/2}T^{-1/4|p|}) for p ≤ -1, Õ(k^{3/2}T^{-1/2}) for -1 < p < 0, and Õ(k^{1/2}T^{-1/2}) for 0 < p ≤ 1. The algorithm achieves the same Nash regret bound as specialized methods while being simpler and more unified.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a unified Explore-Then-UCB algorithm that combines uniform exploration with UCB1. The method first performs uniform exploration for a carefully chosen number of rounds, then switches to UCB1 for arm selection. This approach achieves optimal p-mean regret bounds across different ranges of p: for p ≤ -1, the regret scales as Õ(k^{1/2}T^{-1/4|p|}); for -1 < p < 0, as Õ(k^{3/2}T^{-1/2}); and for 0 < p ≤ 1, as Õ(k^{1/2}T^{-1/2}), matching the lower bound. The algorithm maintains the same Nash regret bound as specialized methods while offering a simpler, more unified framework.

## Key Results
- Introduces p-mean regret as a flexible metric for balancing fairness and efficiency in stochastic bandits
- Proposes unified Explore-Then-UCB algorithm achieving optimal regret bounds across all p ranges
- Theoretical regret bounds: Õ(k^{1/2}T^{-1/4|p|}) for p ≤ -1, Õ(k^{3/2}T^{-1/2}) for -1 < p < 0, Õ(k^{1/2}T^{-1/2}) for 0 < p ≤ 1
- Algorithm matches specialized methods' Nash regret bound while being simpler and more unified
- Experiments validate approach across different reward distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The p-mean regret framework works by providing a parameterized way to balance fairness (worst-case arm performance) and efficiency (overall performance) in stochastic bandits. The unified Explore-Then-UCB algorithm achieves this by first performing uniform exploration to gather initial information about all arms, then switching to UCB1 to exploit the best-performing arms. This combination allows the algorithm to maintain exploration-exploitation balance while achieving optimal regret bounds for different p values. The mechanism leverages the fact that uniform exploration ensures all arms are sampled sufficiently in the initial phase, while UCB1 provides optimal exploitation in the later phase.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Stochastic Bandits**: Sequential decision-making problems where an agent selects actions (arms) to maximize cumulative reward while learning from past observations
   - Why needed: Forms the foundation for understanding the problem setting and evaluation metrics
   - Quick check: Can explain the exploration-exploitation trade-off and regret minimization

2. **p-Mean Regret**: Generalization of regret metrics parameterized by p, where different p values emphasize different aspects of performance (worst-case vs. average)
   - Why needed: Provides the flexible evaluation framework that the paper builds upon
- Quick check: Can compute p-mean regret for different p values and explain its properties

3. **Explore-Then-UCB Algorithm**: Combines uniform exploration phase with UCB1 exploitation phase
   - Why needed: The proposed solution leverages this structure to achieve optimal regret bounds
   - Quick check: Can explain how the exploration phase guarantees sufficient sampling of all arms

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Algorithm -> Uniform Exploration Phase -> UCB1 Exploitation Phase -> p-Mean Regret Bounds

**Critical Path**: Uniform exploration (O(k log T) rounds) → Estimate arm means → UCB1 phase with arm selection based on confidence bounds → Continuous update of p-mean regret

**Design Tradeoffs**: The unified approach sacrifices some specialization for broader applicability across p values, trading algorithm complexity for unified theoretical guarantees

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor performance when reward distributions violate stated assumptions
- Suboptimal results when exploration phase is too short/long relative to problem instance
- Degraded performance when p is near transition points between different regret regimes

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify p-mean regret computation for synthetic bandit instances with known optimal arms
2. Test algorithm performance on Bernoulli rewards with varying arm gaps
3. Compare p-mean regret across different p values for the same bandit instance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical challenges in implementing and tuning the algorithm for different p values
- Experimental validation may not fully capture performance across diverse real-world scenarios
- Algorithm may face challenges when reward distributions deviate from stated assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the algorithm on real-world datasets with varying reward distributions to validate practical performance
2. Conduct extensive experiments comparing the proposed method with existing specialized algorithms across a wide range of problem instances
3. Investigate the sensitivity of the algorithm to its hyperparameters and develop guidelines for practical tuning in different scenarios
