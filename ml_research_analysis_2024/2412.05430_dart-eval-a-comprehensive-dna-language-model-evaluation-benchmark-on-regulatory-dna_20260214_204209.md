## Executive Summary
DART-Eval introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating DNA language models (DNALMs) on regulatory DNA tasks. The benchmark addresses critical limitations in existing evaluations by focusing on biologically relevant tasks including regulatory sequence discrimination, transcription factor motif sensitivity, cell-type specific regulatory DNA identification, quantitative regulatory activity prediction, and variant effect prediction. The evaluation reveals that simpler ab initio supervised models often match or exceed the performance of much larger, fine-tuned DNALMs across most tasks.

The study demonstrates that embedding-free methods (likelihood-based approaches) generally outperform embedding-based methods (embedding distance, final-layer probing) for regulatory DNA prediction tasks. DNALMs particularly struggle with counterfactual prediction tasks, substantially underperforming ab initio models. These findings highlight the importance of rigorous evaluations to accurately assess DNALM capabilities and identify promising directions for future model development in the regulatory genomics space.

## Method Summary
DART-Eval evaluates six state-of-the-art DNALMs (Caduceus, DNABERT-2, GENA-LM, HyenaDNA, Mistral-DNA, and Nucleotide Transformer) across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned settings against strong ab initio baseline models. The benchmark carefully controls for biological confounders and uses high-quality datasets specifically designed for regulatory DNA tasks. Evaluation settings include embedding-based approaches (embedding distance, final-layer probing) and embedding-free approaches (likelihood-based methods). The study compares DNALM performance against simpler supervised ab initio models to assess whether the additional complexity of DNALMs provides practical benefits for regulatory DNA prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Embedding-free methods (likelihood-based approaches) generally outperform embedding-based methods (embedding distance, final-layer probing) for regulatory DNA prediction
- Simpler ab initio supervised models match or exceed the performance of much larger, fine-tuned DNALMs for most regulatory DNA tasks
- DNALMs particularly struggle with counterfactual prediction tasks and underperform ab initio models substantially

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DART-Eval works by providing a standardized, biologically-grounded evaluation framework that isolates specific capabilities required for regulatory DNA prediction. The benchmark's careful control of biological confounders allows for meaningful comparisons between different model classes and evaluation methodologies. By including both embedding-based and embedding-free approaches alongside strong ab initio baselines, the benchmark reveals which aspects of DNALM architecture actually contribute to improved performance on regulatory tasks versus which are simply computational overhead.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Regulatory DNA prediction** - Why needed: Understanding how DNA sequences regulate gene expression is fundamental to genomics and precision medicine. Quick check: Can the model distinguish functional regulatory elements from non-functional sequences with high specificity and sensitivity?
2. **Counterfactual prediction** - Why needed: Assessing how genetic variants affect regulatory function is crucial for interpreting disease-associated mutations. Quick check: Does the model accurately predict the impact of single nucleotide variants on regulatory activity?
3. **Cell-type specificity** - Why needed: Regulatory DNA functions differently across cell types, making cell-type specific predictions essential for understanding tissue-specific gene regulation. Quick check: Can the model accurately identify regulatory elements that function specifically in particular cell types?
4. **Transcription factor binding** - Why needed: TF binding is a key mechanism of gene regulation, and predicting TF binding sites is essential for understanding regulatory networks. Quick check: Does the model accurately identify sequences where specific TFs are likely to bind?
5. **Embedding vs likelihood-based approaches** - Why needed: Different evaluation methodologies may capture different aspects of model capability, affecting performance comparisons. Quick check: Do embedding-based and likelihood-based evaluation methods yield consistent performance rankings across model classes?
6. **Zero-shot vs fine-tuned performance** - Why needed: Understanding when DNALMs can generalize versus when they require task-specific training is crucial for practical applications. Quick check: Does zero-shot performance approach fine-tuned performance, or is task-specific training essential for regulatory DNA prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Regulatory DNA tasks -> Evaluation framework -> Model classes (DNALMs, ab initio) -> Performance metrics -> Biological validation

Critical path: Task definition → Dataset curation → Model evaluation (zero-shot/probed/fine-tuned) → Performance comparison → Biological interpretation

Design tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes biological relevance over computational efficiency, using high-quality datasets and carefully controlled confounders at the expense of evaluation runtime. Embedding-free approaches trade model interpretability for potentially better performance on certain tasks.

Failure signatures: DNALMs fail particularly on counterfactual prediction tasks, suggesting limitations in capturing the nuanced relationship between sequence variation and regulatory function. Embedding-based methods underperform likelihood-based approaches, indicating potential limitations in how embeddings capture regulatory information.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate DNALM zero-shot performance on basic regulatory sequence discrimination to establish baseline capability
2. Compare embedding-based vs likelihood-based evaluation approaches on the same DNALM to assess methodological impact
3. Test ab initio model performance on counterfactual prediction tasks to establish performance floor for regulatory variant effect prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses primarily on regulatory DNA tasks, which represents a narrow slice of genomic function and may not generalize to other biological contexts like protein-coding sequences or structural variation
- The benchmarking methodology, while carefully controlled for confounders, relies on datasets that may not fully represent the diversity of biological variation encountered in real-world applications
- The comparison between embedding-based and likelihood-based approaches is somewhat constrained by the specific implementations chosen, and alternative methodological choices could yield different relative performance rankings

## Confidence
- **Benchmark construction and biological relevance**: High confidence. The benchmark design methodology is rigorous, with explicit control for confounders and use of high-quality datasets. The biological motivation for each task is well-established in the literature.
- **Relative performance comparisons between model classes**: Medium confidence. While the evaluation is thorough, the performance gaps between embedding-free and embedding-based methods, as well as between DNALMs and ab initio models, may depend on specific implementation details that could vary across different experimental setups.
- **Generalizability of findings to broader genomic contexts**: Low confidence. The study's focus on regulatory DNA limits the ability to extrapolate findings to other genomic domains or applications.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-task validation**: Test whether the observed performance patterns hold for non-regulatory genomic tasks, particularly protein-coding sequence prediction and structural variant analysis, to assess generalizability beyond regulatory DNA.
2. **Ablation study on training data**: Systematically evaluate how training data composition affects counterfactual prediction performance by training DNALMs on curated datasets with varying levels of regulatory complexity and biological diversity.
3. **Alternative embedding approaches**: Implement and evaluate alternative embedding-based methods (e.g., attention-weighted embeddings, multi-layer probing) to determine whether the observed limitations of embedding-based approaches are method-specific or represent fundamental constraints of the approach.
