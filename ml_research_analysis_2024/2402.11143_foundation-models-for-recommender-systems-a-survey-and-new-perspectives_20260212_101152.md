# Foundation Models for Recommender Systems: A Survey and New Perspectives

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.11143
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11143
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Key outcome**: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Foundation Models (FMs) applied to recommender systems (FM4RecSys), systematically categorizing research along four dimensions: data characteristics, representation learning, model type, and downstream tasks.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews the application of Foundation Models to recommender systems, categorizing research across four key dimensions: data characteristics, representation learning, model type, and downstream tasks. The authors examine how language FMs, multi-modal FMs, and personalized agent-based approaches can enhance recommendation performance through improved generalization, multi-modal feature integration, and interactive capabilities. The paper identifies critical challenges including handling long sequences, explainability, temporal extrapolation, and cost-efficiency trade-offs, while proposing future directions such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation for recommender systems and benchmarks for multi-modal and agent-based FM4RecSys.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive literature survey of FM4RecSys research, systematically categorizing studies across four dimensions: data characteristics (user profiles, item side information, interaction history, external knowledge), representation learning (ID-based, multi-modal, hybrid), model types (language FMs, multi-modal FMs, personalized agents), and downstream tasks (top-K recommendation, context-aware and interactive recommendation, cross-domain applications, interpretability and fairness). The authors synthesize existing research findings, identify open challenges, and propose future research directions based on the surveyed literature, without conducting original experiments themselves.

## Key Results
- FM4RecSys research spans four key dimensions: data characteristics, representation learning, model type, and downstream tasks
- Language FMs, multi-modal FMs, and personalized agent-based approaches represent the three main model categories for recommendation
- Critical challenges include handling long input sequences, improving explainability, temporal extrapolation, and balancing performance with computational costs
- Future directions include Retrieval-Augmented Generation for recommender systems and benchmarks for multi-modal and agent-based FM4RecSys

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Foundation models enhance recommender systems by leveraging their extensive knowledge bases to improve generalization and personalization, especially in zero-shot/few-shot recommendation scenarios.
- Mechanism: FMs pre-trained on large-scale data capture complex patterns and world knowledge, which can be fine-tuned or prompted to infer user preferences and item characteristics even with limited interaction data, bridging the gap between pre-training and recommendation tasks.
- Core assumption: The extensive pre-training data of FMs contains sufficient generalizable knowledge relevant to recommendation tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Foundation Models (FMs), with their extensive knowledge bases and complex architectures, have offered unique opportunities within the realm of recommender systems (RSs)."
  - [section]: "Foundation Models are designed to learn from large-scale data, enabling them to understand complex patterns. FMs can generalize better to new, unseen data [Bommasani et al., 2021]."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related papers mention foundation models but do not provide direct evidence for generalization in recommendation tasks.
- Break condition: If the pre-training data lacks domain-specific knowledge relevant to the recommendation task, the generalization benefits diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-modal foundation models improve recommendation performance by incorporating rich side information such as images, text, and external knowledge sources.
- Mechanism: MFMs encode multi-modal features (visual, textual, etc.) as inputs, leveraging their robust representation and generalization capabilities to extract richer item features than ID-based representations alone, thereby improving recommendation accuracy.
- Core assumption: Multi-modal side information is available and relevant to the recommendation task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "A promising alternative way lies in leveraging multi-modal side information, including utilizing images [Sarkar et al. , 2023] (such as item visuals), textual content [Li et al., 2023a; Zhang and Wang, 2023 ] (encompassing item titles, descriptions, and reviews), multi-modal elements [Shen et al., 2022; Youwang et al., 2022] (like short video clips and music), and external knowledge sources[Zhai et al., 2023; Xiet al., 2023] (such as item relationships detailed in Wikipedia)."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related papers discuss foundation models but do not provide direct evidence for multi-modal improvements in recommendation tasks.
- Break condition: If multi-modal data is sparse, noisy, or poorly aligned with user-item interactions, the performance gains may be negligible or even negative.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances FM-based recommender systems by integrating external data retrieval to improve accuracy, credibility, and relevance of recommendations.
- Mechanism: RAG combines the FM's internal knowledge with dynamic external knowledge bases, selectively extracting pertinent portions of user interaction history and associated external knowledge to conform to the model's input constraints and reduce hallucinations.
- Core assumption: External knowledge bases contain relevant and up-to-date information that complements the FM's internal knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used in FMs to enhance their generative capability by integrating external data retrieval into the generative process [Gao et al., 2023b]."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Related papers mention RAG but do not provide direct evidence for its effectiveness in recommender systems.
- Break condition: If external knowledge sources are outdated, irrelevant, or too costly to retrieve, the benefits of RAG may not outweigh its computational overhead.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capabilities in natural language understanding and generation.
  - Why needed here: Understanding LLMs is crucial because they form a significant subset of foundation models applied to recommender systems, especially for tasks involving natural language interaction and explanation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks?

- Concept: Multi-modal learning and the integration of different data types (text, images, audio, video) in machine learning models.
  - Why needed here: Multi-modal foundation models are increasingly used in recommender systems to leverage rich side information, requiring an understanding of how to encode and fuse different modalities.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in aligning multi-modal data (e.g., text and images) for recommendation tasks?

- Concept: Knowledge graphs and their role in representing relationships between entities for reasoning and recommendation.
  - Why needed here: Knowledge graphs are often used as external knowledge sources to enhance recommendations, requiring an understanding of how to extract and integrate this structured knowledge into foundation models.
  - Quick check question: How can knowledge graphs be used to improve the explainability and reasoning capabilities of recommender systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Preprocessing Layer -> Representation Learning Layer -> Model Type Layer -> Downstream Task Layer -> Evaluation and Monitoring Layer

- Critical path:
  1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: Collect and preprocess user interaction data, item metadata, and external knowledge sources.
  2. Feature Extraction: Use foundation models to extract representations from IDs, multi-modal data, and hybrid sources.
  3. Model Fine-tuning/Prompting: Adapt foundation models to recommendation tasks through fine-tuning or prompt engineering.
  4. Recommendation Generation: Generate recommendations based on the adapted model's outputs.
  5. Evaluation: Assess performance using relevant metrics and monitor for fairness and explainability issues.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - ID-based vs. Multi-modal Representation: ID-based is simpler but lacks semantic richness; multi-modal is richer but requires more data and computational resources.
  - Fine-tuning vs. Prompting: Fine-tuning is more accurate but computationally expensive; prompting is cheaper but may be less effective for complex tasks.
  - Pre-training vs. Training from Scratch: Pre-training leverages existing knowledge but may not be perfectly aligned with the task; training from scratch is more tailored but requires massive data and resources.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor generalization: Model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data, indicating overfitting or insufficient pre-training knowledge.
  - High latency: Recommendation generation is slow, indicating inefficient model architecture or lack of optimization.
  - Biased recommendations: Model favors certain items or user groups, indicating fairness issues in the training data or model architecture.
  - Lack of explainability: Model's recommendations are not interpretable, indicating insufficient alignment with knowledge bases or reasoning mechanisms.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline Comparison: Implement a simple ID-based representation model and compare its performance to a multi-modal model on a small dataset to quantify the benefits of multi-modal features.
  2. Prompt Engineering: Experiment with different prompt templates for a language FM to optimize its performance on a recommendation task without fine-tuning.
  3. RAG Integration: Integrate a simple RAG mechanism with a language FM to assess its impact on recommendation accuracy and relevance compared to the base model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of different techniques for handling long sequences in FM4RecSys, particularly in terms of recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective methods for improving the explainability and trustworthiness of foundation model-based recommender systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the complexity and size of foundation models as new hurdles in explaining FM4RecSys, mentioning two primary approaches: generating natural language explanations and understanding the model's internal workings.
- Why unresolved: While some works align FMs with knowledge bases like knowledge graphs, these approaches are still in their preliminary phase and could be further enhanced by techniques like Chain/Tree of Thoughts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the effectiveness of different explainability methods in FM4RecSys, including user studies on the perceived trustworthiness and usefulness of the explanations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can foundation models be leveraged to improve the fairness of recommender systems across different user and item groups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of fairness in recommender systems and mentions that research on non-discrimination and fairness in FM4RecSys is still in its early stages.
- Why unresolved: While some works propose methods for improving user-side and item-side fairness, a comprehensive understanding of fairness issues in FM4RecSys and effective solutions are lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies analyzing the fairness of different FM4RecSys approaches across various sensitive attributes and user/item groups, along with the development and evaluation of novel fairness-aware techniques.

## Limitations

- The paper synthesizes existing literature rather than presenting original empirical results, making direct validation of claimed mechanisms difficult
- Evidence supporting key mechanisms comes largely from related papers rather than direct experimental demonstrations within this work
- Critical implementation details such as computational costs, data requirements, and practical deployment considerations are not addressed

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The categorization framework (four-dimensional taxonomy) and identification of open challenges are well-supported by the literature review
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed mechanisms for how FMs enhance recommendation (generalization, multi-modal integration, RAG) are theoretically sound but lack direct experimental validation in this paper
- **Low confidence**: Specific performance claims and quantitative comparisons between different FM4RecSys approaches are not substantiated with original experimental data

## Next Checks

1. **Implement a baseline ID-based FM4RecSys and multi-modal variant** on a standard dataset (e.g., Amazon) to empirically measure the performance gap claimed in the survey
2. **Conduct a controlled experiment** comparing fine-tuning versus prompting strategies for LLMs on a recommendation task to validate the efficiency claims
3. **Prototype a simple RAG-enhanced recommender** to assess the practical benefits and computational overhead of external knowledge integration in real-world recommendation scenarios
