# Test of Time: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Temporal Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09170
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Test of Time (ToT), a novel benchmark evaluating LLMs on temporal reasoning using synthetic datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Test of Time (ToT), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on temporal reasoning tasks. ToT addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by using synthetic datasets that avoid reliance on real-world knowledge and anonymization issues. The benchmark consists of two tasks: ToT-Semantic, focusing on temporal semantics and logic through synthetic problems, and ToT-Arithmetic, assessing temporal arithmetic skills using crowd-sourced questions. Experiments with ToT reveal that graph structure significantly impacts LLM performance, with different question types varying in difficulty. The benchmark also highlights the importance of fact ordering in prompts and provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in temporal reasoning. The datasets and evaluation framework are open-sourced to foster further research.

## Method Summary
ToT uses synthetic datasets to evaluate LLMs on temporal reasoning, consisting of two tasks: ToT-Semantic and ToT-Arithmetic. The ToT-Semantic task involves generating synthetic data with anonymized entities and relations, using diverse graph structures (Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, scale-free, etc.) to test temporal semantics and logic. The ToT-Arithmetic task assesses temporal arithmetic through crowd-sourced questions. The benchmark evaluates LLM performance on different graph structures and fact orderings, providing insights into model capabilities and limitations in temporal reasoning.

## Key Results
- Graph structure significantly impacts LLM performance, with different topologies showing varying levels of difficulty
- Fact ordering in prompts affects LLM performance, with certain orderings leading to better results
- The benchmark successfully isolates temporal reasoning from parametric knowledge exploitation through synthetic datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic datasets prevent LLMs from exploiting parametric knowledge, forcing genuine temporal reasoning.
- Mechanism: By generating data synthetically with anonymized entities and relations, the benchmark removes opportunities for LLMs to rely on memorized facts from pre-training. This isolates the model's reasoning capability from its knowledge retrieval capability.
- Core assumption: LLMs cannot infer real-world entity identities from synthetic names that are type-aligned but distinct.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These studies often rely on real-world data that LLMs may have encountered during pre-training or employ anonymization techniques that can inadvertently introduce factual inconsistencies."
  - [section 2] "To prevent data leakage, TGQA changes each entity name to a name generated by GPT3.5 that is guaranteed to (i) align with the entity's type and (ii) not be otherwise present in YAGO11k. This strategy has several weaknesses."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence, but supported by the discussion of anonymization limitations.
- Break condition: If synthetic names become predictable or if the generation process introduces correlations that LLMs can exploit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Separating temporal semantics and arithmetic tasks enables targeted evaluation of LLM capabilities.
- Mechanism: By creating two distinct tasks (ToT-Semantic for logic/semantics and ToT-Arithmetic for mathematical operations), the benchmark allows researchers to identify specific weaknesses in either domain rather than conflating them.
- Core assumption: Temporal reasoning skills are orthogonal and can be evaluated independently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our benchmark, Test of Time, ToT, is centered around the observation that temporal reasoning often involves two primary skills: 1) understanding the semantics and logic of time, and 2) the ability to carry out temporal arithmetic."
  - [section 3] "To measure and improve model performance along these independent axes, we create a dedicated task for each skill."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence, but the design principle is clearly stated in the paper.
- Break condition: If the two aspects are more intertwined than assumed, making independent evaluation misleading.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph structure significantly impacts LLM temporal reasoning performance, revealing architectural biases.
- Mechanism: By using diverse graph generators (ER, BA, SFN, SBM, star, complete, and anonymized Wikidata extracts), the benchmark exposes how different temporal dependency structures affect LLM reasoning capabilities.
- Core assumption: LLMs process different graph topologies with varying efficiency due to architectural biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "The graph structure of the temporal relationships significantly affects LLM performance, as demonstrated in Table 3."
  - [section 4.1.1] "This indicates that both the number of edges and the specific structure of the graph play a significant role in determining LLM performance."
  - [corpus] Moderate - the paper provides experimental evidence but doesn't deeply explore why different structures affect performance differently.
- Break condition: If performance differences are solely due to graph size rather than structural properties.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph theory and network properties
  - Why needed here: Understanding different graph generators (Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, etc.) and their properties is essential for creating and analyzing the synthetic datasets.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a scale-free network and an Erdős-Rényi random graph?

- Concept: Temporal reasoning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The benchmark is built around temporal reasoning tasks, requiring understanding of temporal logic, interval arithmetic, and temporal dependencies.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Allen's interval algebra relations and simple temporal ordering?

- Concept: Large language model architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and how LLMs process sequential information is crucial for interpreting performance differences.
  - Quick check question: How does positional encoding in transformers affect the processing of temporally ordered information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation pipeline (graph structure generation -> fact assignment -> question generation -> answer labeling) -> LLM evaluation -> Performance analysis -> Insight generation

- Critical path: Data generation → LLM evaluation → Performance analysis → Insight generation. The bottleneck is typically the evaluation step, as running experiments with frontier models requires significant computational resources.

- Design tradeoffs: Synthetic vs. real-world data (synthetic ensures no knowledge leakage but may lack real-world complexity), single-task vs. multi-task evaluation (focused evaluation provides clearer insights but may miss cross-task dependencies), automated vs. human-curated datasets (automation enables scale but may introduce systematic biases)

- Failure signatures: Poor performance on specific graph structures may indicate architectural limitations in processing certain topologies; consistent errors in arithmetic operations may reveal numerical reasoning weaknesses; sensitivity to fact ordering may indicate limitations in attention mechanism or memory

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the graph structure analysis with a smaller subset to verify the methodology works before scaling up
  2. Test the impact of fact ordering on a single graph structure to validate the ordering hypothesis independently
  3. Compare performance on single-fact vs. multi-fact questions within a single graph type to isolate the effect of reasoning complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the complexity of graph structure impact the performance of LLMs in temporal reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how different graph structures, such as Erd˝os-Rényi, Barabási–Albert, and complete graphs, affect LLM performance in the ToT-Semantic task.
- Why unresolved: The study shows that graph structure significantly impacts LLM performance, but it does not delve into the specific mechanisms or thresholds at which complexity becomes a limiting factor.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of LLM performance across a wider range of graph complexities and structures, identifying specific thresholds or patterns in performance degradation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can LLMs generalize temporal reasoning skills learned from synthetic data to real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the use of synthetic datasets to evaluate LLMs on temporal reasoning, but does not explore the transferability of these skills to real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: While synthetic datasets allow for controlled evaluation, they may not fully capture the nuances and variability of real-world temporal reasoning tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating LLM performance on synthetic datasets versus real-world temporal reasoning tasks, assessing the degree of skill transfer and generalization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the order of facts in prompts influence LLM performance in temporal reasoning, and can this be optimized for better results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the impact of fact ordering on LLM performance in the ToT-Semantic task, finding that certain orderings lead to better performance.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies the importance of fact ordering but does not explore the underlying reasons or provide a comprehensive framework for optimizing fact order.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic exploration of different fact ordering strategies, including their impact on various types of temporal reasoning tasks, to develop a generalized approach for optimizing fact order in LLM prompts.

## Limitations

- Benchmark's reliance on synthetic data may create an artificial evaluation environment that doesn't fully capture real-world temporal reasoning complexity
- Assumption that semantic and arithmetic temporal reasoning can be cleanly separated for evaluation purposes
- Synthetic generation process might inadvertently create patterns or correlations that LLMs can exploit without genuine reasoning

## Confidence

*High Confidence:* The synthetic data generation methodology is sound and effectively prevents parametric knowledge exploitation. The benchmark design clearly addresses documented limitations in existing temporal reasoning benchmarks.

*Medium Confidence:* The observation that graph structure affects performance is well-supported by experimental evidence, but the underlying reasons for why certain structures are more challenging remain underexplored. The finding that fact ordering impacts performance is robust, but the magnitude of this effect across different model architectures needs further validation.

*Low Confidence:* The assumption that semantic and arithmetic temporal reasoning can be cleanly separated for evaluation purposes. While the experimental design supports this separation, real-world temporal reasoning likely involves more complex interactions between these capabilities.

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world validation**: Test the same models on established real-world temporal reasoning benchmarks (like TimeDial or TimeQA) to assess how synthetic performance correlates with real-world capability, particularly examining whether models that perform well on ToT also show strong performance on benchmarks with real-world knowledge.

2. **Cross-task dependency analysis**: Design experiments that combine semantic and arithmetic reasoning in single questions to test whether the assumed orthogonality holds, potentially creating hybrid question types that require both skills simultaneously.

3. **Human benchmark comparison**: Conduct human evaluations on the same ToT tasks to establish human performance baselines and compare human vs. LLM performance patterns across different graph structures and question types, particularly focusing on whether humans show similar sensitivity to fact ordering as observed in LLMs.
