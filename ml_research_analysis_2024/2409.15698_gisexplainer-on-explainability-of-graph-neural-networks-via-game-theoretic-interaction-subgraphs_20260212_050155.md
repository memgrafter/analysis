# GISExplainer: On Explainability of Graph Neural Networks via Game-theoretic Interaction Subgraphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15698
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15698
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel GNN explanation method using game-theoretic interaction to identify connected, causally significant explanatory subgraphs with improved fidelity and sparsity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GISExplainer, a novel approach to explain graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying causally significant explanatory subgraphs. Traditional GNN explanation methods often produce disconnected subgraphs and fail to account for interactions between edges, which are essential for understanding how GNNs make predictions. GISExplainer addresses these issues by modeling edges as players in a cooperative game, where coalitions of edges work together to influence predictions. It calculates the causal contribution of edges using a game-theoretic interaction mechanism that considers both positive and negative effects across different coalition scales.

## Method Summary
GISExplainer treats GNN explanation as a sequential decision process where salient edges are successively selected and connected to form an explanatory subgraph. The method uses game-theoretic interaction to quantify the causal effect of edges by considering multi-granularity coalitions. It employs a heuristic search strategy to iteratively select salient edges while maintaining connectivity, and includes an efficiency optimization scheme that reduces computational costs by incorporating connectivity constraints during coalition sampling.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of fidelity and sparsity
- Successfully identifies adversarial perturbations in graph data
- Produces connected explanatory subgraphs that better capture the collaborative effects of edges on GNN predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The method uses game-theoretic interaction to model edge coalitions in explanatory subgraphs. Edges are treated as players in a cooperative game where coalitions form substructures, and their collective influence on GNN predictions is measured using game-theoretic interaction strength. This replaces traditional additive importance scoring with multi-granularity coalition analysis.

### Mechanism 2
The causal screening strategy selects edges based on their marginal contribution to subgraph importance while maintaining connectivity. At each step, candidate edges connected to the current subgraph are evaluated using the game-theoretic interaction-based importance metric. The edge that maximizes the increase in subgraph importance is added, ensuring the subgraph remains connected throughout construction.

### Mechanism 3
The method accounts for both positive and negative effects of edge coalitions on model predictions. Subgraph importance is calculated as the difference between positive and negative coalition effects (T([Gi_s]) = T+([Gi_s]) - T-([Gi_s])). This captures edges that reduce model confidence as well as those that increase it.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and message-passing**: Understanding how GNNs aggregate information through edges is essential since the method operates on GNN computational graphs. Quick check: How does a 2-layer GNN aggregate information from a node's neighborhood?

- **Shapley values and cooperative game theory**: The method uses Shapley values as the foundation for measuring edge contributions and extends them with game-theoretic interaction. Quick check: What does the Shapley value measure for a player in a cooperative game?

- **Graph motifs and substructures**: The method assumes graph substructures (motifs) are the functional units that influence predictions, not individual edges. Quick check: What is a graph motif and why are they considered important in network analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (GNN computation graph, target node) → Heuristic search → Causal screening (with game-theoretic interaction calculation) → Efficiency optimizer → Connected explanatory subgraph output

- **Critical path**: Graph input → Heuristic search → Causal screening (with game-theoretic interaction calculation) → Connected subgraph output

- **Design tradeoffs**: Computational complexity vs. explanation quality, greedy selection vs. global optimization, connectivity constraints vs. flexibility

- **Failure signatures**: Disconnected output subgraphs, excessive computation time, poor fidelity metrics, negative interactions overwhelming positive ones

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run on BA-Shapes dataset with GCN model - verify "house" structure detection
  2. Test on synthetic Tree-Grid dataset - check cyclic structure recognition
  3. Measure efficiency with and without connectivity optimization on Cora dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does GISExplainer's game-theoretic interaction mechanism perform on graphs with more than two layers in GNNs, where deeper dependencies might affect coalition interactions? The paper primarily focuses on two-layer GCN and GIN models, leaving performance on deeper architectures unexplored.

### Open Question 2
Can GISExplainer's efficiency be further improved for large-scale graphs without sacrificing explanation quality, possibly through parallelization or approximation techniques? While the paper optimizes by reducing unnecessary calculations, it does not investigate more advanced computational strategies like distributed computing or approximation algorithms.

### Open Question 3
How does GISExplainer's treatment of negative effects in coalitions influence the stability and interpretability of explanations in real-world noisy or adversarial graph data? The paper emphasizes the importance of considering both positive and negative effects but does not thoroughly analyze how this approach affects explanation stability under noisy or adversarial conditions.

## Limitations

- Computational complexity is not fully characterized, particularly for large graphs with many edges
- Lacks ablation studies on how sensitive results are to the specific choice of coalition sampling strategy
- No theoretical guarantees provided for the quality of explanations produced by the greedy selection algorithm

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core conceptual framework of using game-theoretic interaction for edge attribution is well-founded and novel
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical results showing improved fidelity and sparsity over baselines are convincing, though the number of datasets tested is limited
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability analysis and efficiency optimization claims need more rigorous validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct computational complexity analysis to determine practical limits on graph size and edge count
2. Perform ablation studies comparing different coalition sampling strategies and their impact on explanation quality
3. Test the method on a wider variety of graph types (directed, weighted, heterogeneous) to assess generalizability
