core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of identifying the optimal distance-generating
  function (DGF) for first-order methods (FOMs) in equilibrium computation for extensive-form
  games (EFGs). The authors introduce a pair of primal-dual treeplex norms as a new
  framework for analyzing the strong convexity of DGFs in EFGs.

- The weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) regularizer is optimal up to logarithmic factors for first-order methods in extensive-form games

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fundamental limits on the performance of first-order methods for computing equilibria in extensive-form games. The authors introduce a novel framework using primal-dual treeplex norms to analyze distance-generating functions (DGFs) and prove that dilated entropy is the optimal regularizer up to logarithmic factors. They complement this upper bound with a matching lower bound showing that no DGF can achieve a better diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio than ln|V| in the worst case. The work also refines the convergence rate analysis of Clairvoyant OMD, achieving a state-of-the-art rate of O(n log|V| log T/T) for n-player games.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a primal-dual treeplex norm framework to analyze the strong convexity properties of distance-generating functions in extensive-form games. They introduce a specific lower bound instance based on a modified binary search game with carefully constructed utilities that create sparse losses. The proof strategy involves decomposing the game tree into subtrees and analyzing the regret accumulation across these components. The lower bound construction ensures that any algorithm must incur regret proportional to the logarithmic diameter of the treeplex, establishing the optimality of dilated entropy up to logarithmic factors.

## Key Results
- Dilated entropy achieves optimal diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio of ln|V| up to logarithmic factors
- New lower bound of Ω(√T log T) for online learning in sequence-form strategy spaces
- Clairvoyant OMD achieves O(n log|V| log T/T) convergence rate to coarse correlated equilibrium
- Primal-dual treeplex norms provide a unified framework for analyzing DGF optimality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The optimality of dilated entropy stems from its unique balance between diameter and strong convexity properties in treeplex structures. The dilated entropy regularizer naturally adapts to the hierarchical tree structure of extensive-form games, maintaining strong convexity while keeping the feasible region's diameter small. This creates an optimal ratio that cannot be improved upon by any other DGF. The lower bound construction exploits the inherent difficulty of making progress in games with sparse loss vectors, demonstrating that any algorithm must suffer regret proportional to the treeplex diameter.

## Foundational Learning

**Treeplex geometry**: Understanding the tree-like structure of extensive-form games and how strategies are represented as sequences. This is needed to analyze the geometry of the strategy space and design appropriate DGFs. Quick check: Verify that the treeplex diameter is indeed O(log|V|) for the game instances considered.

**Mirror descent and online mirror descent**: The connection between DGFs and optimization algorithms in convex spaces. This provides the algorithmic framework for equilibrium computation. Quick check: Confirm that the convergence rates scale appropriately with the strong convexity parameter of the DGF.

**Strong convexity and smoothness**: These properties determine the convergence rates of first-order methods and are directly influenced by the choice of DGF. Quick check: Verify that the strong convexity parameter for DilEnt is indeed Ω(1/ln|V|) in the constructed lower bound instance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Treeplex geometry -> DGF selection -> Mirror descent algorithm -> Equilibrium computation -> Regret analysis

**Critical path**: The theoretical analysis proceeds from the treeplex geometry properties, through the lower bound construction, to the optimality proof for DilEnt, and finally to the algorithmic implications.

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper balances between theoretical optimality (achieving the best possible diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio) and practical considerations (simplicity of implementation and numerical stability).

**Failure signatures**: If a different DGF is used, the convergence rate would degrade by at least a logarithmic factor in the treeplex diameter. If the treeplex structure is not properly exploited, the diameter could increase dramatically.

**First experiments**:
1. Implement the lower bound construction and verify that any DGF incurs Ω(√T log T) regret
2. Compare DilEnt against other common DGFs (Euclidean, entropy) on small EFG instances
3. Test the refined Clairvoyant OMD rate on benchmark EFGs to verify the O(n log|V| log T/T) convergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, focusing instead on establishing the optimality of dilated entropy. However, several natural extensions arise: Can the logarithmic factors be eliminated under additional assumptions about game structure? How do the results extend to different equilibrium concepts beyond coarse correlated equilibrium? What is the practical impact of these theoretical improvements on large-scale EFG instances?

## Limitations
- The analysis is asymptotic and focuses on logarithmic factors, leaving constant factors unexamined
- Limited experimental validation with only theoretical convergence rate comparisons
- The lower bound construction is specific to a particular game structure and may not capture all practical scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The theoretical framework and lower bound proofs are rigorous and well-supported
**Medium confidence**: The optimality claim for DilEnt is strong but depends on logarithmic factors that could hide important constant differences
**Low confidence**: The practical implications without empirical validation on real EFG instances

## Next Checks

1. Implement empirical comparisons of DilEnt against other DGFs on benchmark EFG instances to verify the practical impact of the theoretical improvements
2. Analyze the constant factors in the diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio for different DGFs to determine when DilEnt's advantage becomes significant
3. Extend the analysis to different game structures (e.g., sparse vs dense information sets) to understand how the treeplex properties affect the optimal DGF choice
