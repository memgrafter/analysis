# SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.09990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09990
- Authors: Amogh Joshi; Adarsh Kumar Kosta; Kaushik Roy
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SHIRE achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains compared to baseline policies in OpenAI Gym environments with negligible computational overhead

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of poor sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL), where policies require many interactions with the environment to converge. The authors propose SHIRE, a framework that encodes human intuition as a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) and integrates it into the DeepRL training pipeline to improve sample efficiency and policy explainability. SHIRE constructs an "intuition net" based on simple task-specific human understanding, encodes abstract states, and computes an intuition loss that is added to the standard RL loss function. Experiments on various OpenAI Gym environments (CartPole, MountainCar, LunarLander, Swimmer, Taxi) demonstrate significant sample efficiency gains while maintaining or improving training performance.

## Method Summary
SHIRE integrates human intuition into the DeepRL training pipeline by encoding it as a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). The framework constructs an "intuition net" based on simple task-specific human understanding, which encodes abstract states and computes an intuition loss. This intuition loss is then added to the standard RL loss function during training. By leveraging human knowledge, SHIRE aims to accelerate policy learning and make the resulting policies more explainable by teaching them elementary behaviors derived from human intuition.

## Key Results
- SHIRE achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains compared to baseline policies across tested OpenAI Gym environments
- The framework maintains or improves training performance while making policies more explainable
- Computational overhead is negligible, measured in microseconds per sample

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SHIRE works by encoding human intuition as a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) and integrating it into the DeepRL training pipeline. The intuition net captures task-specific human understanding, which helps guide the policy learning process. By incorporating this prior knowledge, the framework reduces the search space and accelerates convergence. Additionally, the intuition loss encourages the learned policy to exhibit behaviors that align with human expectations, making it more explainable.

## Foundational Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL): Why needed - To learn complex policies in high-dimensional environments; Quick check - Ensure the framework can handle non-linear function approximation
- Sample Efficiency: Why needed - To reduce the number of interactions required for policy convergence; Quick check - Measure the number of samples needed to reach a performance threshold
- Explainability: Why needed - To provide insights into the learned policy's decision-making process; Quick check - Evaluate the interpretability of the learned policy using human-in-the-loop methods

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Human Intuition -> Intuition Net -> Intuition Loss -> DeepRL Agent

### Critical Path
1. Encode human intuition as a PGM
2. Construct the intuition net based on the PGM
3. Compute the intuition loss during training
4. Integrate the intuition loss into the DeepRL loss function
5. Train the DeepRL agent with the modified loss function

### Design Tradeoffs
- Accuracy vs. Complexity: Balancing the complexity of the intuition net with its ability to capture human intuition accurately
- Computational Overhead: Ensuring the intuition loss computation does not significantly increase training time
- Generalization: Ensuring the intuition net can be applied to diverse tasks and environments

### Failure Signatures
- Incorrect Human Intuition: If the encoded human intuition is incorrect or incomplete, it may lead to suboptimal policies or hinder learning
- Overfitting to Human Intuition: If the policy relies too heavily on the intuition net, it may fail to generalize to unseen situations
- Computational Bottleneck: If the intuition loss computation becomes a significant overhead, it may limit the framework's applicability to large-scale or real-time applications

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate SHIRE on simple control tasks (e.g., CartPole) to validate its effectiveness in improving sample efficiency
2. Test the framework on more complex tasks (e.g., LunarLander) to assess its scalability and robustness
3. Investigate the impact of incorrect or incomplete human intuition on policy performance to identify potential failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, some potential areas for future research include:
- Extending SHIRE to more complex, high-dimensional tasks (e.g., Atari games, robotic manipulation)
- Investigating strategies to mitigate the impact of incorrect or incomplete human intuition on policy performance
- Analyzing the computational overhead during large-scale training and its implications for real-time or resource-constrained applications

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond OpenAI Gym environments, particularly to complex, high-dimensional tasks
- Dependence on the quality of human intuition encoded in the PGM, which may lead to suboptimal policies if incorrect or incomplete
- Potential biases introduced by human intuition and the framework's adaptability when human knowledge is limited or unavailable

## Confidence

### High
- The reported sample efficiency gains (25-78%) and negligible computational overhead are supported by experimental results on the tested environments

### Medium
- The claim of improved policy explainability is plausible given the integration of human intuition, but the extent and practical utility of this explainability are not fully quantified

### Low
- The assertion that SHIRE maintains or improves training performance is based on limited experiments and may not hold across diverse tasks or environments

## Next Checks
1. Test SHIRE on more complex, high-dimensional tasks (e.g., Atari games, robotic manipulation) to assess its scalability and robustness
2. Investigate the impact of incorrect or incomplete human intuition on policy performance and identify strategies to mitigate potential negative effects
3. Conduct a detailed analysis of the computational overhead during large-scale training and its implications for real-time or resource-constrained applications
