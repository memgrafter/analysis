# The Foundational Capabilities of Large Language Models in Predicting Postoperative Risks Using Clinical Notes

## Quick Facts

- Pre-trained LLMs outperform traditional embeddings by 38.3% AUROC and 33.2% AUPRC in perioperative risk prediction

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) significantly outperform traditional word embeddings in predicting postoperative risks using clinical notes, with absolute improvements of 38.3% in AUROC and 33.2% in AUPRC. The research systematically evaluates three fine-tuning strategies—self-supervised, semi-supervised, and foundational multi-task learning—finding that each successive approach yields performance gains. Foundational multi-task learning achieved the highest improvements of 3.6% AUROC and 2.6% AUPRC compared to self-supervision. The results establish that a single fine-tuned LLM can effectively predict multiple postoperative outcomes, offering potential for clinical deployment in perioperative care.

## Method Summary
The study uses 84,875 pre-operative clinical notes from Barnes Jewish Hospital and 52,234 surgical cases from MIMIC-III to predict six postoperative risks. Pre-trained clinical LLMs (ClinicalBERT, BioClinicalBERT, BioGPT) are compared against traditional embeddings (CBOW, doc2vec, GloVe, FastText). Embeddings are extracted from clinical text and used to train XGBoost classifiers. Three fine-tuning strategies are evaluated: self-supervised (MLM/NSP), semi-supervised (with outcome labels), and foundational multi-task learning across all outcomes. Performance is measured using AUROC, AUPRC, MSE, and R2 across 5-fold cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Pre-trained LLMs outperformed traditional embeddings by 38.3% AUROC and 33.2% AUPRC
- Self-supervised fine-tuning improved AUROC by 3.2% and AUPRC by 1.5%
- Foundational multi-task learning achieved highest gains of 3.6% AUROC and 2.6% AUPRC over self-supervision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained LLMs capture clinically relevant contextual representations that outperform traditional word embeddings in perioperative risk prediction.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained LLMs have been exposed to large biomedical and clinical corpora during training, enabling them to encode semantic and syntactic nuances of clinical language, including abbreviations and specialized terminology.
- Core assumption: The training corpora of pre-trained LLMs contain sufficient clinical context overlap with perioperative clinical notes to transfer generalizable knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Pre-trained LLMs outperformed traditional word embeddings by an absolute AUROC of 38.3% and AUPRC of 33.2%."
  - [section]: "Our results demonstrate that (A) pre-trained LLMs can lead to significant improvements over traditional word embeddings, signalling a new era in leveraging LLMs in perioperative care."
  - [corpus]: No direct citation support found in neighboring papers; claim relies on internal experimental evidence.
- Break condition: If perioperative notes contain highly domain-specific jargon not present in pre-training corpora, performance gains may diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning strategies further improve LLM performance by adapting model weights to the target perioperative dataset.
- Mechanism: Self-supervised fine-tuning aligns the model distribution with the target domain, while semi-supervised fine-tuning incorporates outcome labels to refine predictive features.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM weights are close enough to optimal for the perioperative domain that small-scale fine-tuning yields measurable gains without overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Self-supervised fine-tuning further improved performance by 3.2% and 1.5%."
  - [section]: "Adapting models further improved performance: (1) self-supervised finetuning by 3.2% for AUROC and 1.5% for AUPRC."
  - [corpus]: No supporting citation; performance improvement is inferred from experimental results.
- Break condition: If the target dataset is too small or too different, fine-tuning may overfit or fail to converge.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-task foundational fine-tuning yields the highest performance by sharing knowledge across multiple perioperative outcomes.
- Mechanism: A unified model trained on multiple labels learns shared representations that generalize better than single-task models.
- Core assumption: Perioperative outcomes share underlying risk factors and clinical signals that can be jointly exploited.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Foundational multi-task learning yielded the highest gains of 3.6% in AUROC and 2.6% in AUPRC compared to self-supervision."
  - [section]: "With the introduction of foundational finetuning, we were able to use a single model to outperform various bespoke models for different tasks."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus; claim is derived from internal benchmarking.
- Break condition: If outcomes are unrelated, MTL may dilute task-specific signal and hurt performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pre-trained model weight initialization
  - Why needed here: Enables transfer learning from biomedical corpora to perioperative domain without starting from random weights.
  - Quick check question: Do the pre-trained LLMs have exposure to clinical abbreviations and perioperative terminology in their training data?

- Concept: Fine-tuning objective selection
  - Why needed here: Aligns model optimization with the structure of perioperative prediction tasks (classification vs regression).
  - Quick check question: Are the self-supervised and semi-supervised objectives appropriate for the label distribution in the perioperative dataset?

- Concept: Multi-task label pooling
  - Why needed here: Allows a single model to learn shared predictive features across multiple outcomes, improving generalization.
  - Quick check question: Do the chosen perioperative outcomes have overlapping clinical features that justify multi-task training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained LLM (BioGPT, ClinicalBERT, BioClinicalBERT) -> Embedding extractor -> ML predictor (XGBoost, logistic regression, neural network) -> Fine-tuning pipeline (self-supervised → semi-supervised → foundational) -> Evaluation module (AUROC, AUPRC, MSE, R2)

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained LLM
  2. Extract embeddings from perioperative notes
  3. Train baseline predictor on embeddings
  4. Apply self-supervised fine-tuning
  5. Apply semi-supervised fine-tuning with outcome labels
  6. Apply foundational multi-task fine-tuning
  7. Evaluate performance at each stage

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding quality vs model size (larger LLMs may overfit on small datasets)
  - Fine-tuning duration vs marginal gains (foundational MTL may require more epochs)
  - Task specificity vs generalization (single-task models may outperform MTL if outcomes are unrelated)

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance plateaus or degrades after fine-tuning → overfitting or domain mismatch
  - High variance across folds → unstable embeddings or insufficient data
  - Baseline word embeddings outperform LLM embeddings → poor pre-training corpus overlap

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare pre-trained LLM embeddings vs traditional embeddings (CBOW, GloVe) on perioperative outcomes without any fine-tuning.
  2. Apply self-supervised fine-tuning and measure AUROC/AUPRC gains over the baseline LLM.
  3. Apply semi-supervised fine-tuning with outcome labels and compare to self-supervised results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal fine-tuning strategy for LLMs in perioperative risk prediction across different clinical contexts and outcome types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares self-supervised, semi-supervised, and foundational multi-task learning strategies, finding foundational models achieved highest performance but acknowledges no single strategy dominates across all tasks
- Why unresolved: The study shows performance varies by outcome type and model architecture, with no universal winner, suggesting context-specific optimization may be needed
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons across diverse clinical settings and outcome types, including temporal dynamics and varying dataset sizes, would clarify optimal strategies

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do pre-trained clinical LLMs perform when integrated with non-textual clinical features in perioperative risk prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study explicitly excluded non-textual variables (demographics, preoperative measurements, intraoperative variables) and acknowledges this as a limitation
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates strong performance using text alone but doesn't explore potential synergies with structured clinical data
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing text-only versus text-plus-structured-data approaches across multiple perioperative outcomes would clarify the value of multimodal integration

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the generalizability of pre-trained clinical LLMs across different healthcare systems and patient populations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study used data from two sites only and acknowledges this as a limitation, noting uncertainty about generalizability
- Why unresolved: Performance on two specific datasets may not translate to broader healthcare contexts with different documentation practices and patient demographics
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the same models across multiple healthcare systems with diverse patient populations, documentation styles, and care practices would establish generalizability boundaries

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do different machine learning predictors perform when applied to textual embeddings from various clinical LLMs across different perioperative tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found no single predictor consistently outperformed others and noted logistic regression performed surprisingly well
- Why unresolved: The relationship between embedding quality, task characteristics, and optimal predictor choice remains unclear
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparisons across diverse clinical tasks, embedding types, and predictor architectures would identify optimal combinations for specific use cases

## Limitations
- Performance gains are demonstrated on a single hospital system (BJH) and MIMIC-III; generalizability to other institutions or clinical settings remains uncertain.
- Critical text preprocessing steps and hyperparameter configurations are referenced to appendices without full disclosure, limiting exact reproducibility.
- Claims about single-model clinical deployment readiness are speculative without external validation or prospective trials.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Pre-trained LLMs significantly outperform traditional embeddings in perioperative risk prediction (38.3% AUROC, 33.2% AUPRC absolute gains).
- Medium Confidence: Fine-tuning strategies (self-supervised, semi-supervised, foundational MTL) yield consistent incremental improvements, though exact hyperparameter impacts are unspecified.
- Low Confidence: Claims about single-model clinical deployment readiness are speculative without external validation or prospective trials.

## Next Checks
1. **External Dataset Validation**: Replicate experiments on an independent perioperative dataset from a different institution to assess generalizability of LLM performance gains.
2. **Ablation of Preprocessing Pipeline**: Systematically vary text preprocessing steps (tokenization, vocabulary size, noise handling) to quantify their impact on LLM vs traditional embedding performance.
3. **Fine-Tuning Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Conduct grid searches over learning rates, batch sizes, and fine-tuning epochs for each strategy to identify optimal configurations and overfitting thresholds.
