# NUMOSIM: A Synthetic Mobility Dataset with Anomaly Detection Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03024
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03024
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: NUMOSIM provides a synthetic mobility dataset with injected anomalies for benchmarking geospatial anomaly detection techniques, addressing privacy and annotation challenges of real-world data

## Executive Summary
NUMOSIM is a synthetic mobility dataset designed to benchmark geospatial anomaly detection algorithms. The dataset addresses critical challenges in real-world mobility data collection, including privacy concerns and the difficulty of obtaining labeled anomaly ground truth. Generated through advanced deep learning models trained on real mobility data, NUMOSIM simulates the trajectories of a large population of synthetic agents in urban areas, injecting both non-recurring and recurring anomalies to evaluate detection algorithms' ability to capture demographic, geospatial, and temporal factors. The initial release focuses on Los Angeles, providing comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmark results for multiple detection methods.

## Method Summary
NUMOSIM uses a Deep Activity Model (DeepAM) - a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture trained on household travel survey data - to generate realistic activity chains. The pipeline generates synthetic activity sequences, assigns Points of Interest (POIs), routes agents through road networks, and injects anomalies into the test period. Three baseline anomaly detection methods (RioBusData CNN adaptation, STOD GRU adaptation, and GM-VSAE VAE adaptation) are evaluated using Average Precision and AUCROC metrics at both staypoint-level and agent-level granularity. The dataset includes demographic information, POI details, and stay point files for train and test periods with injected anomalies.

## Key Results
- DeepAM generates synthetic mobility data that captures realistic demographic, geospatial, and temporal patterns from household travel survey data
- Three baseline anomaly detection methods achieve varying performance on NUMOSIM, with specific results reported for Average Precision and AUCROC metrics
- The dataset successfully benchmarks anomaly detection algorithms' ability to identify both non-recurring (isolated deviations) and recurring (pattern shifts) anomalies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Deep generative models trained on household travel survey data can capture the complex interplay of demographic, geospatial, and temporal factors in human mobility patterns. The Deep Activity Model uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to generate realistic activity chains by embedding sociodemographic data and household member relationships, then predicting activity types and temporal sequences through self-attention layers. Core assumption: Household travel survey data contains sufficient information to model the dependencies between household members' activities and their environmental context. Evidence: Generated through advanced deep learning models trained on real mobility data; DeepAM is trained on 180,000 samples from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Break condition: If household travel survey data lacks critical behavioral patterns or contains sampling biases that aren't representative of the target population, the generated synthetic data will fail to capture real-world complexity.

### Mechanism 2
Synthetic data with strategically injected anomalies provides a controlled benchmark for evaluating anomaly detection algorithms. NUMOSIM injects both non-recurring (isolated deviations) and recurring (pattern shifts) anomalies into the test period, creating labeled ground truth that real-world datasets cannot provide. Core assumption: Anomalies injected into synthetic data can effectively test whether detection algorithms capture the interplay between demographic, geospatial, and temporal factors. Evidence: Strategically injecting anomalies to challenge and evaluate detection algorithms; NUMOSIM dataset includes two primary types of anomalies: non-recurring anomalies and recurring anomalies. Break condition: If injected anomalies don't reflect realistic deviation patterns or if the anomaly injection process introduces artifacts that make detection artificially easy or hard, the benchmark validity is compromised.

### Mechanism 3
Transfer learning enables NUMOSIM to adapt mobility patterns to different geographic regions while maintaining realistic behavioral dynamics. Future releases will use transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the deep activity model with local human mobility data, allowing the model to capture distinct activity patterns characteristic of different regions. Core assumption: Core behavioral dynamics learned from national survey data can be effectively adapted to regional contexts with limited additional training data. Evidence: Will employ transfer learning techniques, enabling our deep activity model to adapt to the local customs and behaviors of each area; incorporating more complex and rare behavioral patterns and social interactions. Break condition: If regional mobility patterns differ fundamentally from those captured in national surveys, or if insufficient local data is available for effective fine-tuning, transfer learning may fail to produce realistic regional datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer-based sequence generation
  - Why needed here: The complex dependencies between activities in mobility patterns require capturing long-range temporal relationships and contextual information.
  - Quick check question: What architectural component allows the model to capture relationships between activities that may be far apart in the sequence?

- Concept: Poisson process modeling for visit rates
  - Why needed here: The visit rate model assumes that the number of times an agent visits a POI follows a Poisson process, which provides a statistical baseline for anomaly detection.
  - Quick check question: Why is the Poisson distribution appropriate for modeling visit counts in a fixed time window?

- Concept: Jensen-Shannon divergence for distribution comparison
  - Why needed here: JSD is used to evaluate the realism of generated activity patterns by comparing distributions of generated versus real-world data across multiple dimensions.
  - Quick check question: What advantage does Jensen-Shannon divergence have over other distance metrics when comparing probability distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DeepAM → POI assignment → Road network navigation → Schedule output; Anomaly injection system (non-recurring and recurring); Benchmarking framework (multiple detection methods); Dataset distribution (supplemental files and stay point files)
- Critical path: Real mobility survey data → DeepAM training → Synthetic activity generation → POI assignment → Road network routing → Anomaly injection → Dataset release
- Design tradeoffs: The dataset prioritizes controlled anomaly evaluation over perfect realism, using survey data rather than GPS traces for privacy and annotation feasibility
- Failure signatures: Poor anomaly detection performance may indicate either overly simplistic anomalies or detection methods that fail to capture key mobility features
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate synthetic data for a small population and visually inspect activity sequences for realism and temporal consistency
  2. Apply the visit rate anomaly detection method to verify that injected anomalies are detectable using simple statistical features
  3. Compare the distribution of activity durations, start times, and POI visit frequencies between synthetic and real NHTS data using Jensen-Shannon divergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How sensitive is the NUMOSIM anomaly detection benchmark to the specific types and frequencies of injected anomalies? The paper describes two types of injected anomalies (non-recurring and recurring) and provides benchmark results, but doesn't explore sensitivity to different anomaly configurations. The paper doesn't systematically vary anomaly types or frequencies to test detection algorithm robustness. Experiments showing detection performance across different anomaly injection strategies and frequencies would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
Can the Deep Activity Model (DeepAM) be effectively transferred to generate synthetic mobility data for regions with significantly different cultural contexts and mobility patterns than the training data? The paper mentions plans to use transfer learning for new regions but doesn't demonstrate or evaluate this capability. The paper only shows results for Los Angeles and mentions future plans for Cairo without validating the transfer learning approach. Successful generation and validation of realistic mobility data for culturally distinct regions using transfer learning would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal granularity level (agent, staypoint, trip, or point-level) for anomaly detection in mobility data, and how does this choice affect detection performance? The paper mentions different granularity levels are supported but only provides benchmark results at agent and staypoint levels. The paper doesn't compare detection performance across different granularity levels or determine which is optimal for different use cases. Comparative analysis of detection performance across all granularity levels with specific recommendations for different scenarios would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The synthetic nature of the dataset means detection algorithms optimized for NUMOSIM may not generalize perfectly to real-world applications
- The anomaly injection process may introduce artifacts that don't reflect naturally occurring anomalies
- Reliance on survey data rather than GPS traces may limit the complexity of captured mobility patterns

## Confidence

- High confidence: The synthetic data generation pipeline and anomaly injection mechanisms are well-specified and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The benchmark results are valid for the specific methods tested, but generalizability to other detection algorithms remains uncertain
- Low confidence: Claims about transfer learning effectiveness for regional adaptation are forward-looking and not yet validated

## Next Checks

1. Validate the synthetic data's realism by comparing the distribution of key mobility features (activity durations, temporal patterns, spatial distributions) against independent real-world datasets using statistical divergence measures.

2. Test the benchmark's sensitivity by systematically varying anomaly injection parameters and measuring their impact on detection performance across different methods.

3. Conduct a transferability study where detection algorithms trained on NUMOSIM are evaluated on real-world mobility datasets to assess practical applicability.
