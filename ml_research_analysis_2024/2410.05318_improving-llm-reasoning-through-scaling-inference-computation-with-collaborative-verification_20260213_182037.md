# Improving LLM Reasoning through Scaling Inference Computation with Collaborative Verification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05318
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05318
- Reference count: 11
- Qwen-72B-Instruct achieves 95.6% accuracy on GSM8k and 76.9% on MATH with CoTnPoT filtering

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving reasoning verification in large language models by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) approaches. The authors propose a comprehensive framework that collects correct and incorrect solutions for math and code reasoning tasks, trains verifiers using preference tuning methods, and employs a novel CoTnPoT filtering technique that leverages the complementary strengths of both approaches. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The approach involves constructing a dataset of correct and incorrect solutions for math and code reasoning problems, then training verifiers using preference tuning methods. The core innovation is the CoTnPoT filtering technique, which combines the intuitive reasoning paths of Chain-of-Thought with the structured, executable nature of Program-of-Thought solutions. This collaborative verification system evaluates multiple solution paths and selects the most reliable answer through cross-verification between different reasoning modalities, achieving superior performance compared to single-approach methods.

## Key Results
- Math-Rev and Code-Rev verifiers outperform existing baselines on GSM8k and MATH benchmarks
- Qwen-72B-Instruct with CoTnPoT filtering achieves 95.6% accuracy on GSM8k
- Same configuration achieves 76.9% accuracy on MATH benchmark
- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated against GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism succeeds by combining the intuitive, human-like reasoning paths of Chain-of-Thought approaches with the structured, verifiable nature of Program-of-Thought solutions. CoT provides natural language reasoning that can capture complex logical relationships, while PoT offers executable code that can be programmatically verified. The collaborative verification framework exploits these complementary strengths by cross-checking solutions across both modalities, reducing the likelihood of systematic errors that might affect one approach but not the other.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning** - Why needed: Enables LLMs to break down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps that mirror human problem-solving approaches. Quick check: Can the model generate coherent intermediate steps for a math problem?
2. **Program-of-Thought (PoT) reasoning** - Why needed: Provides structured, executable representations of solutions that can be automatically verified for correctness. Quick check: Does the generated code correctly implement the intended algorithm?
3. **Preference tuning** - Why needed: Trains verifiers to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality solutions based on human preferences and correctness criteria. Quick check: Can the verifier accurately rank two solutions from the same problem?
4. **Collaborative filtering** - Why needed: Combines multiple solution approaches to leverage their complementary strengths and reduce individual weaknesses. Quick check: Does the ensemble approach outperform any single method on benchmark tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Dataset Construction -> Preference Tuning -> CoTnPoT Filtering -> Solution Selection
- **Critical path:** The pipeline flows from collecting solution data, through training verifiers, to applying collaborative filtering for final answer selection. The CoTnPoT filtering stage is the critical component where both CoT and PoT solutions are evaluated and combined.
- **Design tradeoffs:** The system trades computational efficiency for accuracy by generating and evaluating multiple solution paths. While this increases inference time, it significantly improves reliability and correctness rates.
- **Failure signatures:** The approach may struggle with problems requiring domain-specific knowledge not present in training data, or when both CoT and PoT approaches fail to capture the problem's essential structure.
- **First experiments:**
  1. Verify that CoT and PoT solutions can be generated independently for benchmark problems
  2. Test verifier accuracy on distinguishing correct from incorrect solutions in isolation
  3. Evaluate CoTnPoT filtering performance against single-approach baselines on a small validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on single reasoner model (Qwen-72B-Instruct) limits generalizability across different LLM architectures
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate individual contributions of CoT and PoT components
- No quantitative analysis of when each approach succeeds or fails independently

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Verification methodology and dataset construction are technically sound and well-documented, with strong evidence against established baselines.

**Medium Confidence:** State-of-the-art claims are well-supported for Qwen-72B-Instruct specifically, but broader applicability to other models remains uncertain.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about complementary strengths leveraging lack empirical support without ablation studies or qualitative analysis of approach-specific success patterns.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-model generalization test: Evaluate Math-Rev and Code-Rev verifiers with multiple reasoner models to verify performance consistency across architectures.

2. Ablation analysis: Conduct systematic experiments removing CoT or PoT components individually to quantify their specific contributions.

3. Long-term stability assessment: Test verifier performance across extended time periods and on dynamically generated problems to evaluate robustness against distribution shifts.
