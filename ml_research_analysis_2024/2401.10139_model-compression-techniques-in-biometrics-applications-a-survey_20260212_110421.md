## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines model compression techniques—quantization, knowledge distillation (KD), and pruning—in biometrics applications, addressing the challenge of deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of compression methods, including their mathematical foundations and state-of-the-art applications in face recognition, periocular recognition, and other biometrics tasks. Key findings include the effectiveness of quantization in achieving significant memory and computational savings, KD’s superiority in preserving model performance while reducing complexity, and pruning’s ability to eliminate redundant connections.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on model compression techniques in biometrics, focusing on quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning. It analyzes the mathematical foundations of each method and their applications in biometrics tasks such as face recognition, periocular recognition, and iris recognition. The study evaluates the effectiveness of these techniques in reducing computational and memory costs while maintaining performance, with a particular emphasis on fairness implications. The survey identifies key challenges, such as compression-induced bias, and proposes future research directions, including fairness-aware compression strategies and hybrid methods. The analysis is based on a review of 40 references, providing a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in this field.

## Key Results
- Quantization effectively reduces memory and computational costs by lowering bit precision of weights and activations.
- Knowledge distillation preserves model performance while reducing complexity by transferring knowledge from a teacher to a student model.
- Pruning eliminates redundant connections, reducing model size without significant performance degradation.
- Compression techniques can disproportionately affect underrepresented demographic groups, leading to fairness concerns.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Quantization reduces computational and memory costs by representing weights and activations with fewer bits without significant performance degradation.
- Mechanism: By lowering the precision of model parameters (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers), quantization reduces memory bandwidth and computational load, especially on hardware optimized for low-precision operations.
- Core assumption: The model's performance remains acceptable because over-parameterized networks can tolerate quantization-induced errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "quantization in achieving significant memory and computational savings"
  - [section]: "lower bit-precision models have also been able to achieve near FP accuracy, especially when large networks are being considered"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors focus on other topics like set function learning and drowsiness detection, not quantization.
- Break condition: If quantization leads to significant performance degradation, especially for underrepresented groups, the assumption fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a complex teacher model to a simpler student model, enabling the student to achieve competitive performance.
- Mechanism: KD guides the student model by providing soft labels or intermediate features from the teacher, allowing the student to focus on relevant information and avoid overfitting.
- Core assumption: The teacher model has learned useful representations that can be effectively distilled to the student.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KD’s superiority in preserving model performance while reducing complexity"
  - [section]: "distilling the teacher’s knowledge to the student model may improve its performance, avoiding misinterpretations of the provided data"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not discuss KD or knowledge transfer.
- Break condition: If the teacher-student gap is too large, the student may not effectively learn from the teacher, leading to poor performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pruning removes redundant connections in a neural network, reducing its size and computational cost while maintaining performance.
- Mechanism: By identifying and eliminating less important weights or channels, pruning reduces the model's complexity without significantly impacting its ability to perform the task.
- Core assumption: The network contains redundant connections that do not contribute significantly to performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "pruning’s ability to eliminate redundant connections"
  - [section]: "pruning strategies compress networks by tearing apart some of their parts"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not discuss pruning or model compression.
- Break condition: If pruning removes too many important connections, the model's performance will degrade significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantization
  - Why needed here: Quantization is essential for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices, as it reduces memory and computational requirements.
  - Quick check question: How does quantization affect the precision of model parameters and what are the trade-offs in terms of performance and efficiency?
- Concept: Knowledge Distillation
  - Why needed here: KD is crucial for compressing complex models into simpler ones while preserving performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.
  - Quick check question: What are the different types of KD (e.g., response-based, feature-based) and how do they impact the student model's learning process?
- Concept: Pruning
  - Why needed here: Pruning is important for reducing the size of neural networks by removing redundant connections, which is beneficial for deployment on devices with limited resources.
  - Quick check question: How does pruning affect the architecture of a neural network and what are the challenges in maintaining performance after pruning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Quantization: Reduces bit precision of weights and activations.
  - Knowledge Distillation: Transfers knowledge from teacher to student model.
  - Pruning: Removes redundant connections in the network.
- Critical path:
  1. Apply quantization to reduce model size and computational cost.
  2. Use KD to transfer knowledge from a complex teacher to a simpler student.
  3. Prune the network to remove redundant connections and further reduce size.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Quantization vs. KD vs. Pruning: Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance, efficiency, and complexity.
  - Bit precision in quantization: Lower bit precision reduces size and computational cost but may impact performance.
  - Teacher-student gap in KD: A larger gap can lead to more compression but may result in poorer student performance.
  - Sparsity level in pruning: Higher sparsity reduces size but may degrade performance.
- Failure signatures:
  - Quantization: Significant performance degradation, especially for underrepresented groups.
  - KD: Poor student performance due to large teacher-student gap or ineffective knowledge transfer.
  - Pruning: Severe performance degradation due to removal of important connections.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply quantization to a pre-trained model and evaluate performance on a benchmark dataset.
  2. Use KD to compress a complex model into a simpler one and compare performance with the original model.
  3. Prune a neural network to different sparsity levels and analyze the impact on performance and model size.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the iterative application of quantization and knowledge distillation (KD) within the same framework impact the overall performance and bias of compressed models compared to applying each technique separately?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that combining quantization and KD could lead to better results by allowing early compensation of compression-induced losses and improved model adaptation.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions this as a promising research direction, it does not provide experimental evidence or a detailed analysis of the impact of such a combined approach on model performance and bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that compare the performance and bias of models compressed using iterative quantization and KD against models compressed using each technique separately, while considering different sparsity levels and KD strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal teacher-student gap for knowledge distillation in biometrics applications, and how does it affect the efficiency of knowledge transfer and the final model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of the teacher-student gap in KD and suggests that a smaller gap can lead to more efficient knowledge transfer, but it does not provide specific guidelines for determining the optimal gap.
- Why unresolved: The optimal teacher-student gap likely depends on the specific task, dataset, and model architectures involved, making it challenging to establish a universal guideline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic study that investigates the impact of different teacher-student gaps on the performance and efficiency of KD in various biometrics tasks, considering different model architectures and datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the fairness of compressed models vary across different sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender, age) and what are the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the issue of bias in compressed models and highlights the need for fairness-aware compression techniques, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how fairness varies across different sensitive attributes.
- Why unresolved: The fairness of compressed models is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including the compression technique used, the model architecture, and the dataset characteristics. Understanding the variations in fairness across different sensitive attributes requires a detailed investigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a large-scale study that evaluates the fairness of compressed models across multiple sensitive attributes, considering different compression techniques, model architectures, and datasets. This study should also investigate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to fairness variations.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of compression techniques varies significantly across different biometrics tasks and datasets, making it challenging to establish universal guidelines.
- The survey does not provide experimental validation of its claims, relying instead on a synthesis of existing research.
- The lack of standardized benchmarks for fairness evaluation in compressed models remains a significant challenge in the field.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general effectiveness of quantization, KD, and pruning in reducing model size and computational cost is well-established, supported by extensive literature.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific impact of compression techniques on biometrics performance and fairness requires further empirical validation, as the survey synthesizes existing studies without conducting new experiments.
- **Low Confidence**: The long-term implications of compression-induced bias and the effectiveness of fairness-aware strategies are not yet fully understood, necessitating more research.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing the performance and fairness of compressed models (using quantization, KD, and pruning) on a balanced biometrics dataset (e.g., RFW) to validate the survey's claims.
2. Implement and evaluate a fairness-aware compression strategy (e.g., FairGRAPE) on a real-world biometrics application to assess its effectiveness in mitigating bias.
3. Explore hybrid compression methods (e.g., combining quantization and pruning) on a complex biometrics model to determine the optimal balance between performance, efficiency, and fairness.
