# A Survey of Resource-efficient LLM and Multimodal Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.08092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08092
- Reference count: 40
- This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on resource-efficient algorithms and systems for large foundation models

## Executive Summary
This survey addresses the significant computational and memory challenges posed by large foundation models (LLMs, vision transformers, diffusion models, and multimodal models) by systematically categorizing and summarizing resource-efficient techniques. It covers model architectures, algorithms, and systems across the model lifecycle from pre-training to deployment, examining both algorithmic approaches (efficient attention, dynamic neural networks, compression) and system-level optimizations (distributed training, federated learning, serving systems). The work serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and implement strategies for developing and deploying resource-efficient large foundation models.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews 40 recent papers from top-tier CS conferences and arXiv, primarily published after 2020, to compile a comprehensive taxonomy of resource-efficient techniques. It covers four main model types (LLMs, vision transformers, diffusion models, and multimodal models) and organizes content across three key areas: Resource-efficient Architectures (Section 3), Resource-efficient Algorithms (Section 4), and Resource-efficient Systems (Section 5). The methodology involves identifying techniques that improve efficiency in terms of computing, memory, storage, and bandwidth while maintaining or improving model performance, with coverage spanning from algorithmic optimizations to system-level innovations.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive survey covering 40 recent papers on resource-efficient algorithms and systems for large foundation models
- Systematic categorization across model lifecycle stages: pre-training, fine-tuning, inference, and deployment
- Coverage of multiple model types including LLMs, ViTs, diffusion models, and multimodal models with unified taxonomy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey provides a comprehensive overview of resource-efficient algorithms and systems for large foundation models
- Mechanism: The paper systematically categorizes and summarizes various techniques across model lifecycle stages (pre-training, fine-tuning, inference, deployment) using a structured taxonomy
- Core assumption: A structured taxonomy can effectively organize diverse research techniques across multiple model types and lifecycle stages
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey systematically categorizes and summarizes various techniques aimed at improving efficiency, covering model architectures, algorithms, and systems across the model lifecycle"
  - [section] The paper is organized with clear sections for Resource-efficient Architectures, Resource-efficient Algorithms, and Resource-efficient Systems
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - only 5 papers mention "survey" and none directly reference this specific paper
- Break Condition: The taxonomy becomes too fragmented or misses key emerging techniques, reducing its utility for practitioners

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Resource-efficient techniques span from algorithmic optimizations to system-level innovations
- Mechanism: The paper covers both algorithmic approaches (like efficient attention, dynamic neural networks, model compression) and system-level optimizations (distributed training, federated learning, serving systems)
- Core assumption: Both algorithmic and system-level optimizations are necessary to address the resource challenges of large foundation models
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey delves into the critical importance of such research, examining both algorithmic and systemic aspects"
  - [section] The paper is divided into Resource-efficient Algorithms (§4) and Resource-efficient Systems (§5) sections
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence supporting this specific claim
- Break Condition: Focus on only algorithmic or only system-level optimizations proves insufficient for practical deployment

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey covers multiple model types including LLMs, ViTs, diffusion models, and multimodal models
- Mechanism: The paper provides dedicated sections for each model type's resource-efficient techniques while maintaining unified categorization across types
- Core assumption: Different model architectures require specialized resource-efficient techniques while sharing some common principles
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on resource-efficient algorithms and systems for large foundation models, including large language models, vision transformers, diffusion models, and multimodal models"
  - [section] The paper has separate subsections for Language Foundation Models (§2.1), Vision Foundation Models (§2.2), and Multimodal Foundation Models (§2.3)
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence supporting this specific claim
- Break Condition: New model types emerge that don't fit the existing categorization framework

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The survey extensively discusses transformer-based models and their variants, requiring understanding of attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder architecture, and self-attention computation
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of standard self-attention in terms of sequence length T and hidden dimension D?

- Concept: Model compression techniques
  - Why needed here: The survey dedicates significant coverage to model compression methods (pruning, knowledge distillation, quantization, low-rank decomposition) as key resource-efficiency strategies
  - Quick check question: How does quantization-aware training differ from post-training quantization in terms of model adaptation?

- Concept: Distributed systems and parallel computing
  - Why needed here: The survey covers distributed training systems, including data parallelism, model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and communication optimization techniques
  - Quick check question: What are the primary communication bottlenecks in data-parallel training of large models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Foundation Model Overview (Section 2) -> Resource-efficient Architectures (Section 3) -> Resource-efficient Algorithms (Section 4) -> Resource-efficient Systems (Section 5)

- Critical path: Understanding model costs → Learning architectural optimizations → Mastering algorithmic techniques → Implementing system optimizations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs efficiency: Many techniques trade some model accuracy for resource savings
  - Training cost vs inference efficiency: Some optimizations benefit inference more than training
  - Hardware specificity: Techniques may be optimized for specific hardware (GPU, CPU, edge)

- Failure signatures:
  - Overly aggressive compression causing model quality degradation
  - Distributed training configurations causing communication bottlenecks
  - Edge deployment attempts failing due to memory constraints

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and benchmark KV cache optimization techniques (like vLLM's PagedAttention) on a small transformer model
  2. Apply LoRA fine-tuning to a pre-trained model and measure parameter reduction vs accuracy impact
  3. Set up a simple data-parallel training configuration with mixed precision to observe memory savings and speed improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific mechanisms and challenges involved in achieving a balance between privacy preservation and performance in federated learning systems for large foundation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of privacy preservation in federated learning for foundation models and mentions the use of privacy-preserving technologies such as federated learning, differential privacy, and emulator-based tuning. However, it also notes that these methods face significant performance challenges.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the importance of privacy in federated learning, it does not provide specific details on the mechanisms or challenges involved in achieving a balance between privacy and performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the performance trade-offs associated with different privacy-preserving techniques in federated learning, including specific examples of how these techniques impact model accuracy and training efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the runtime sparsity of large foundation models be effectively exploited to reduce inference time and memory footprint beyond the current approaches like PowerInfer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that large foundation models exhibit runtime sparsity, where only a subset of neurons are consistently activated across inputs. It also discusses PowerInfer, which leverages this sparsity to reduce GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a high-level overview of the concept of runtime sparsity but does not delve into the specific techniques or challenges involved in exploiting this sparsity for efficient inference.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study of different methods for identifying and exploiting runtime sparsity in large foundation models, including quantitative comparisons of their effectiveness in reducing inference time and memory usage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the key factors that determine the optimal size and speed of foundation models for on-device deployment, and how can these factors be balanced to achieve ubiquitous, privacy-preserving, and highly available general intelligence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trend of foundation models sinking to near-user devices and mentions the importance of determining the optimal size and speed for on-device deployment. It also highlights the potential applications of on-device foundation models, such as personal assistants/agents and multimodal information retrieval.
- Why unresolved: While the paper recognizes the importance of on-device deployment, it does not provide specific insights into the factors that influence the optimal size and speed of foundation models for this purpose.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of the trade-offs between model size, inference speed, and performance for different on-device deployment scenarios, along with guidelines for selecting the appropriate model size and speed based on specific application requirements and device constraints.

## Limitations
