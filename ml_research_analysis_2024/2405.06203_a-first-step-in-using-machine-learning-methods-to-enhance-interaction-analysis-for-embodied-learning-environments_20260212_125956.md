# A First Step in Using Machine Learning Methods to Enhance Interaction Analysis for Embodied Learning Environments

## Quick Facts

- A visual timeline tool integrates multimodal data to support interaction analysis in embodied learning environments

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an AI-enhanced timeline tool to support interaction analysis in embodied learning environments, where students collaboratively simulate scientific processes. The tool integrates multimodal data—movements, gaze, affect, and system logs—into a synchronized visual timeline, enabling researchers to analyze complex learning behaviors more efficiently. By combining machine learning algorithms with human interpretation, the system captures and visualizes students' states, actions, and emotional responses during activities like a photosynthesis simulation. Results show the timeline effectively aligns AI-generated insights with interaction analysis, revealing learning patterns and emotional dynamics. The tool enhances temporal data presentation, aiding pattern recognition and performance evaluation. Future work includes expanding the tool for broader educational contexts and refining modalities like conversational data. This approach advances multimodal learning analytics by bridging AI capabilities with human expertise in embodied learning research.

## Method Summary
The study developed a visual timeline tool that integrates multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) with interaction analysis (IA) for embodied learning environments. The tool processes video streams, system logs, gaze tracking, and affect detection data using machine learning algorithms including face detection (MTCNN), emotion recognition (HSEmotions), and gaze estimation (L2CS-Net + ZoeDepth). Data from four video cameras, wireless microphones, screen recordings, and system logs are synchronized using the ChimeraPy framework. The processed data is displayed on an interactive timeline synchronized with video playback, allowing researchers to navigate between AI-generated insights and original footage. The system was tested with 7-8 students participating in a photosynthesis simulation activity.

## Key Results
- The timeline effectively aligns AI-generated insights with interaction analysis, revealing learning patterns and emotional dynamics
- Multimodal synchronization across video, gaze, affect, and system logs enables comprehensive temporal analysis
- Discrete emotion labeling based on continuous valence-arousal scores improves interpretability for educational contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AI-generated multimodal visualizations reduce cognitive load for researchers analyzing embodied learning.
- Mechanism: By aggregating and aligning disparate data streams (movement, gaze, affect, system logs) into a single interactive timeline, the tool presents complex behavioral patterns in a format that is easier to scan and interpret than raw video.
- Core assumption: Human researchers can efficiently extract meaning from visualized patterns rather than sequential frame-by-frame analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "visual timeline that displays MMLA results, tailored to augment IA"
  - [section] "Our multimodal timeline... marks a significant advance in examining student interactions within mixed-reality learning settings."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about cognitive load or visualization efficacy.
- Break condition: If researchers find the visual timeline more cognitively taxing or miss critical events visible only in raw video, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Synchronizing multimodal data with video playback enables cross-validation between AI and human analysis.
- Mechanism: The timeline is synchronized with video, allowing researchers to jump between AI-generated insights and original footage, facilitating verification and deeper investigation of "aha moments."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For each video analyzed by human researchers through IA, individual student timelines were produced, allowing for new rounds of IA."
  - [section] "The video and timeline are executed together and it is possible to navigate to specific events and zoom in/out to control the granularity of the data being shown."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about cross-validation efficacy.
- Break condition: If synchronization is inaccurate or researchers distrust AI outputs, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Discrete emotion labeling based on continuous valence-arousal scores improves interpretability for educational contexts.
- Mechanism: Continuous emotional states are mapped to discrete categories (engagement, boredom, confusion, frustration, delight) using Russell's circumplex model and D'Mello's dynamics, making patterns recognizable in the timeline.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "These scores are then categorized into learning-centered emotions based on Russell's circumflex of emotions and D'Mello's dynamics of affective states."
  - [section] "The system was initially configured to read input from a video file, initializing tools for face detection, facial landmark extraction, and emotion recognition."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about educational emotion labeling.
- Break condition: If discrete labels misrepresent continuous emotional dynamics or are not meaningful to researchers, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Embodied learning and multimodal data
  - Why needed here: Understanding that embodied learning involves physical movement, gaze, and affect as key data streams, not just verbal or digital interactions.
  - Quick check question: What are the primary modalities captured in this study beyond video?
- Concept: Interaction Analysis (IA) methodology
  - Why needed here: IA is the human analytical framework that the AI tool aims to support, so understanding its principles is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the main goal of Interaction Analysis in embodied learning contexts?
- Concept: Machine learning for affect and gaze detection
  - Why needed here: The study uses ML algorithms to process facial expressions and gaze data, so knowing how these algorithms work is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main steps in the affect detection pipeline described?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Ingestion: Video streams (4 cameras), wireless microphones, screen recordings, system logs
  - ML Processing: Face detection (MTCNN), emotion recognition (HSEmotions), gaze estimation (L2CS-Net + ZoeDepth), student re-identification, system log parsing
  - Data Alignment: Time synchronization across all modalities using ChimeraPy framework
  - Visualization: Interactive timeline with synchronized video playback, modular modality display
- Critical path: ML processing → data alignment → timeline visualization → researcher interaction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. speed: Fine-tuning MTCNN and using HSEmotions prioritizes speed over perfect accuracy for real-time analysis.
  - Granularity vs. cognitive load: Aggregating gaze and affect into 5-second intervals balances detail with readability.
  - Modality inclusion vs. complexity: Starting with core modalities (movement, gaze, affect, system logs) avoids overwhelming the interface.
- Failure signatures:
  - Misaligned timestamps causing temporal inconsistencies in the timeline
  - Missing or incorrect student re-identification leading to conflated emotion/gaze data
  - Overwhelming visual complexity preventing pattern recognition
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test timeline synchronization accuracy by comparing AI-identified events with manual video timestamps.
  2. Validate emotion labeling by comparing ML outputs with human-coded affect labels on sample frames.
  3. Assess gaze encoding accuracy by checking if gaze vectors correctly intersect with labeled objects of interest in the 3D reconstruction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the timeline tool affect learning outcomes when directly integrated into the classroom for real-time teacher feedback?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions future work includes tailoring the tool for teachers and using findings to assist students during learning activities, but does not provide evidence of classroom integration or its impact on learning outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on using the tool for post-hoc analysis by researchers, not real-time classroom use. No data exists on how real-time feedback might influence student performance or engagement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled classroom trials comparing groups with and without real-time timeline feedback, measuring learning gains, engagement, and behavioral changes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the accuracy of gaze estimation in 3D environments vary across different age groups, particularly for children?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that applying computer-vision methods to children remains problematic because they have not been trained on their data, and highlights the need for models tailored to children.
- Why unresolved: The study used models like L2CS-Net and ZoeDepth, which were not specifically trained on children, leading to potential inaccuracies in gaze tracking for younger participants.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing gaze estimation accuracy across age groups using models trained on diverse datasets, including children.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating conversational data into the timeline tool on the depth and accuracy of interaction analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions ongoing weekly meetings to refine the tool, including the inclusion of conversational data, but does not provide results on its impact.
- Why unresolved: While the tool currently integrates gaze, affect, and system logs, conversational data has not been analyzed or visualized, leaving its potential contributions unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of interaction patterns with and without conversational data integrated, comparing the richness of insights and accuracy of learning behavior interpretations.

## Limitations
- Small sample sizes (7-8 students) in single-session implementations limit generalizability
- Affect detection system assumes frontal face visibility and adequate lighting
- Timeline tool's efficacy depends on researcher familiarity with both interaction analysis and multimodal data interpretation
- Modular design for additional modalities remains theoretical without empirical validation

## Confidence

- Multimodal synchronization accuracy: **Medium**
- AI-generated insights aligning with interaction analysis: **Low-Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comparative analysis between AI-generated timeline insights and independent human interaction analysis coding to measure alignment rates and identify systematic divergences.
2. Perform usability testing with interaction analysis researchers to evaluate whether the timeline reduces analysis time and cognitive load compared to traditional video-based methods.
3. Validate affect detection accuracy by comparing ML-generated emotional labels against human-coded affect data across different lighting conditions and face orientations.
