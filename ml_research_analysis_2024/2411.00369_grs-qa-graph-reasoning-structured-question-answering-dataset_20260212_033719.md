core_contribution: This paper introduces GRS-QA, the first question-answering dataset
  that pairs each instance with explicit reasoning graphs representing logical steps
  to the answer. The dataset categorizes reasoning structures into 12 types (e.g.,
  comparison, bridge, compositional) and includes both positive and negative graph
  variants to isolate the impact of structure versus content.

# GRS-QA -- Graph Reasoning-Structured Question Answering Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00369
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Introduces GRS-QA, the first QA dataset with explicit reasoning graphs, showing that structured golden evidence improves LLM performance while question complexity reduces accuracy.

## Executive Summary
GRS-QA is the first question-answering dataset that pairs each instance with explicit reasoning graphs representing logical steps to the answer. The dataset categorizes reasoning structures into 12 types and includes both positive and negative graph variants to isolate the impact of structure versus content. Experiments show that BM25 retrieval outperforms DPR and TF-IDF, while LLM performance decreases as question complexity increases. Providing structured golden evidence and reasoning graphs improves LLM accuracy compared to unstructured evidence or retrieved results. Negative reasoning graphs sometimes reduce performance, highlighting sensitivity to misleading paths.

## Method Summary
The GRS-QA dataset introduces a novel approach to question answering by incorporating explicit reasoning graphs that map out the logical steps required to reach an answer. Questions are categorized into 12 reasoning structure types (e.g., comparison, bridge, compositional) and each instance includes both positive and negative reasoning graph variants. The dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities by providing golden structured evidence alongside traditional text passages. Retrieval experiments compare BM25, DPR, and TF-IDF methods, while LLM experiments assess performance with and without structured reasoning support.

## Key Results
- BM25 retrieval consistently outperforms DPR and TF-IDF across all question types
- LLM performance decreases systematically as question complexity increases
- Golden structured evidence and reasoning graphs improve LLM accuracy compared to unstructured evidence
- Negative reasoning graphs sometimes reduce performance, indicating sensitivity to misleading logical paths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GRS-QA works by providing explicit structural scaffolding that guides LLM reasoning through logical step-by-step pathways. The reasoning graphs act as cognitive maps that decompose complex questions into manageable sub-steps, reducing the computational burden on the model. By including both positive and negative graph variants, the dataset isolates the effect of reasoning structure from content, revealing that the presence of well-formed reasoning graphs can significantly improve performance even when content is identical. The 12-category taxonomy captures distinct reasoning patterns that map to different cognitive processes, allowing targeted evaluation of model capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph-based reasoning**: Understanding how reasoning graphs represent logical dependencies and decision paths. Why needed: Essential for interpreting the dataset's core innovation and evaluation methodology.
- **Question complexity taxonomy**: Familiarity with the 12 reasoning structure categories (comparison, bridge, compositional, etc.). Why needed: Required to understand how different question types affect model performance.
- **Retrieval method differences**: Understanding BM25 vs DPR vs TF-IDF characteristics. Why needed: Critical for interpreting the retrieval experiments and their implications.
- **LLM reasoning evaluation**: Knowledge of how structured evidence affects model performance. Why needed: Fundamental to understanding the dataset's contribution to QA evaluation.
- **Positive vs negative evidence effects**: Understanding how misleading reasoning paths impact performance. Why needed: Key insight into model sensitivity to reasoning structure quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Question -> Retrieval Method (BM25/DPR/TF-IDF) -> Evidence (Unstructured/Structured) -> Reasoning Graph (Positive/Negative) -> LLM Output -> Performance Evaluation

Critical path: Question → Retrieval → Evidence Selection → Reasoning Graph Application → LLM Processing → Performance Measurement

Design tradeoffs: Structured evidence provides clear reasoning paths but requires additional annotation effort; negative graphs test robustness but may introduce confusion; the 12-category taxonomy provides granularity but may not capture all reasoning types.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation with increased complexity; sensitivity to negative reasoning graphs; retrieval method failure modes for specific question types.

First experiments:
1. Baseline LLM performance on GRS-QA without any reasoning graphs
2. Performance comparison using positive vs negative reasoning graphs with identical content
3. Retrieval method ablation study across different question complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size and diversity may limit generalizability of observed performance patterns
- Inconsistent effects of negative reasoning graphs without clear thresholds for impact
- Aggregate retrieval method comparisons lack detailed analysis of type-specific performance differences
- 12-category taxonomy requires validation for distinctiveness and coverage across domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: LLM performance decreases with question complexity
- Medium confidence: 12-category reasoning structure taxonomy distinctiveness
- Medium confidence: Golden structured evidence improves performance over unstructured evidence
- Low confidence: Generalizability of retrieval method comparisons across domains

## Next Checks
1. Dataset Expansion Validation: Test the reasoning graph approach on an independently constructed dataset with different domains and question distributions to assess whether the 12-category taxonomy and performance patterns hold.

2. Negative Graph Effect Analysis: Conduct controlled experiments varying the similarity between positive and negative reasoning graphs to determine the precise conditions under which misleading structures impact performance.

3. Retrieval Method Granularity: Perform detailed ablation studies comparing BM25, DPR, and TF-IDF across different reasoning structure types and question complexity levels to identify specific failure modes and strengths of each approach.
