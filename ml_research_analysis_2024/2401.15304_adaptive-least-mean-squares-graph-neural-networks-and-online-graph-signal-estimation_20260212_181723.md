# Adaptive Least Mean Squares Graph Neural Networks and Online Graph Signal Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15304
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15304
- Authors: Yi Yan; Changran Peng; Ercan Engin Kuruoglu
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: LMS-GNN achieves more accurate online predictions compared to adaptive graph filters and graph convolutional neural networks, with lower Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error across different noise levels.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Adaptive Least Mean Squares Graph Neural Networks (LMS-GNN), a novel approach for online estimation of time-varying graph signals corrupted by noise and missing values. The LMS-GNN combines adaptive graph filters with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture time variation and bridge cross-space-time interactions. By updating filter coefficients via backpropagation based on estimation error at each time step, the model effectively handles the challenges of missing data, noise, and time variation in a simple and interpretable manner.

## Method Summary
The LMS-GNN combines adaptive graph filters with GNNs to estimate time-varying graph signals with missing data and noise. At each time step, the model performs forward propagation similar to adaptive graph filters, where the output is based on the error between observation and prediction. The filter coefficients are then updated via backpropagation, similar to GNNs. The method is trained using the residuals of the estimation at each time step, allowing it to learn and adapt to time-varying dynamics while leveraging the spatial structure of the graph.

## Key Results
- LMS-GNN achieves more accurate online predictions compared to adaptive graph filters and graph convolutional neural networks.
- The model shows lower Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error across different noise levels.
- LMS-GNN effectively handles missing data, noise, and time variation in a simple and interpretable manner.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The LMS-GNN effectively captures time-varying graph signal dynamics by combining adaptive graph filters with GNNs, allowing online updates based on estimation error.
- Mechanism: At each time step, the LMS-GNN uses a forward propagation similar to adaptive graph filters where the output is based on the error between observation and prediction. The filter coefficients are then updated via backpropagation, similar to GNNs. This allows the model to learn and adapt to time-varying dynamics while also leveraging the spatial structure of the graph.
- Core assumption: The time-varying graph signal can be approximated as a bandlimited signal in the spectral domain, and the bandlimited filter can be learned from the data rather than being predefined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The LMS-GNN is a combination of adaptive graph filters and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). At each time step, the forward propagation of LMS-GNN is similar to adaptive graph filters where the output is based on the error between the observation and the prediction similar to GNN."
  - [section] "The LMS-GNN combines the advantages of GNNs and adaptive graph filters: rather than predefining a fixed filter using prior knowledge like in GSP methods, LMS-GNN uses a Neural Network structure to learn the filter from the given missing and noisy observations."
- Break condition: If the time-varying graph signal cannot be approximated as a bandlimited signal, or if the filter cannot be effectively learned from the noisy and missing data, the LMS-GNN may not capture the dynamics accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The LMS-GNN effectively handles missing data and noise corruption in the graph signal by leveraging the denoising capabilities of GNNs and the error-based updates of adaptive filters.
- Mechanism: The GNN layers in the LMS-GNN serve as denoising layers, learning to filter out noise from the input signal. The adaptive filter backbone then updates based on the residual error between the observed and estimated signals, allowing it to correct for missing data and refine the estimation.
- Core assumption: The GNN layers can effectively learn to denoise the input signal, and the adaptive filter updates can compensate for missing data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LMS-GNN aims to capture the time variation and bridge the cross-space-time interactions under the condition that signals are corrupted by noise and missing values."
  - [section] "Instead of aggregating only the signal as seen in most GNNs, the adaptive filter backbone of LMS-GNN enables it to capture the time-varying signal dynamics."
- Break condition: If the noise level is too high or the missing data rate is too severe, the GNN denoising may not be sufficient, and the adaptive filter updates may not be able to compensate effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The LMS-GNN achieves high model interpretability and low computational complexity by combining the spatial aggregation of GNNs with the spectral filtering of adaptive graph filters in a simple architecture.
- Mechanism: The LMS-GNN uses a straightforward combination of GNN layers and adaptive filter updates, avoiding the need for complex preprocessing or postprocessing steps. This allows for clear interpretation of the model's behavior and efficient computation.
- Core assumption: The simple combination of GNN and adaptive filter components is sufficient to capture the necessary spatial and temporal features of the graph signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The combination of GNNs with adaptive graph filters makes the LMS-GNN simple yet efficient, offering high model interpretability and low computational complexity."
  - [section] "The combination of GNNs with adaptive graph filters makes the LMS-GNN simple yet efficient, offering high model interpretability and low computational complexity."
- Break condition: If the graph signal has complex spatial and temporal features that cannot be captured by the simple LMS-GNN architecture, the model may lack the necessary expressiveness and performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> GNN Layers -> Adaptive Filter -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Forward propagation through GNN layers to denoise and aggregate spatial features
  2. Adaptive filter update based on error between observed and estimated signals
  3. Backward propagation to update filter coefficients via backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: Simpler architectures like LMS-GNN offer higher interpretability but may lack the expressiveness of more complex models.
  - Fixed vs. adaptive filters: Adaptive filters can handle time-varying signals but may be more sensitive to noise and missing data.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on signals with high noise levels or severe missing data
  - Inability to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
  - Overfitting to training data, leading to poor generalization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare LMS-GNN performance with fixed graph filters on a synthetic time-varying graph signal with known dynamics.
  2. Evaluate the denoising capability of the GNN layers by adding increasing levels of noise to the input signal and measuring the output signal quality.
  3. Test the adaptability of the LMS-GNN by introducing sudden changes in the signal dynamics and measuring the model's ability to adjust to the new patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, based on the content, some potential open questions could be:

- How would LMS-GNN perform on extremely sparse or highly irregular graph structures compared to dense or regular graphs?
- What is the impact of different activation functions on LMS-GNN's performance, especially in handling non-linear relationships in graph signals?
- How does LMS-GNN scale with increasing graph size and time steps in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements?

## Limitations
- The paper's experiments are limited to a single real-world dataset (temperature data), which may not generalize to other types of graph signals.
- The assumption that time-varying signals can be effectively approximated as bandlimited in the spectral domain may not hold for all types of graph signals.
- The performance under extreme noise conditions (beyond 40% missing data) is not thoroughly evaluated.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The combination of adaptive filters with GNNs for online learning is well-grounded theoretically and demonstrates clear advantages in handling time-varying signals with missing data.
- **Medium Confidence**: The model's effectiveness in handling noise corruption and its computational efficiency claims are supported by experiments, but would benefit from testing on additional datasets and noise scenarios.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the approach to different types of graph signals and structures beyond temperature data and 8-nearest-neighbor graphs remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalizability Test**: Apply the LMS-GNN to at least two additional real-world graph signal datasets (e.g., traffic flow, social network activity) to evaluate performance across different domains.

2. **Robustness Analysis**: Systematically test the model's performance under extreme noise conditions (60-80% missing data) and compare with state-of-the-art methods to validate robustness claims.

3. **Computational Efficiency Validation**: Measure and compare the actual computational complexity (training time, memory usage) of LMS-GNN against baseline methods across different graph sizes to confirm efficiency claims.
