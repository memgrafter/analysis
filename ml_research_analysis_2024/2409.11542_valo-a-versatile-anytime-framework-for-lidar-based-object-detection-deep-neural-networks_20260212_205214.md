# VALO: A Versatile Anytime Framework for LiDAR-based Object Detection Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.11542
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11542
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: VALO achieves higher accuracy across all deadline constraints compared to state-of-the-art baselines while demonstrating effectiveness down to 90ms deadlines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of enabling dynamic latency-accuracy tradeoffs in LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles. It introduces VALO, a data-centric framework that transforms LiDAR object detection DNNs into anytime (contract) algorithms by selectively processing subsets of input regions to meet varying deadline constraints. VALO combines three key techniques: (1) a deadline-aware scheduler that partitions and schedules LiDAR input regions, (2) a lightweight forecasting mechanism that predicts poses of previously detected objects to mitigate accuracy loss from partial input processing, and (3) an input reduction technique in detection heads that eliminates redundant computation. Evaluated on CenterPoint and VoxelNext models using the nuScenes dataset on Jetson AGX Xavier, VALO achieves higher accuracy across all deadline constraints compared to state-of-the-art baselines while demonstrating effectiveness down to 90ms deadlines. The approach shows versatility across different DNN architectures and incurs minimal scheduling overhead (6ms).

## Method Summary
VALO transforms LiDAR object detection into anytime computing by partitioning the detection area into vertical regions and selectively processing subsets based on deadline constraints. The framework uses a history-based approach to predict execution times of 3D backbone blocks from input voxel counts, enabling accurate scheduling decisions. To mitigate accuracy loss from partial input processing, VALO maintains a queue of previously detected object poses and updates their positions using a simple physics model based on velocity and ego-vehicle movement. Additionally, VALO optimizes detection heads by selectively gathering and batching small patches corresponding to object proposals, applying convolutions only to relevant data instead of the full input volume. The framework is evaluated on nuScenes dataset with CenterPoint and VoxelNext models on Jetson AGX Xavier hardware.

## Key Results
- VALO achieves higher accuracy across all deadline constraints (90-350ms) compared to CenterPoint75, VoxelNext75, and AnytimeLidar baselines
- Scheduling overhead is minimal at 6ms, with region scheduling time increasing linearly with the number of regions
- Forecasting mechanism improves accuracy by 6-7% when processing only 2-3 out of 6 regions
- Input reduction technique in detection heads provides significant acceleration without sacrificing accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VALO achieves anytime computing by scheduling subsets of input regions instead of skipping architectural components.
- Mechanism: The framework partitions the LiDAR detection area into equally sized vertical regions, then uses a greedy policy to select the maximum number of input regions that can be processed within the given deadline. This maintains spatial continuity and avoids accuracy degradation from slicing non-adjacent regions.
- Core assumption: Selecting adjacent regions maintains sufficient spatial coverage for accurate object detection while reducing computational load.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "VALO employs a deadline-aware scheduler to selectively process input regions, making execution time and accuracy tradeoffs without architectural modifications."
  - [section] "Instead, we focus on developing a single model that can deliver the highest possible accuracy when there is flexibility with the deadline, while intelligently adjusting input data when the deadline becomes more stringent."
- Break condition: If the distribution of objects becomes highly non-uniform such that critical objects consistently fall outside the scheduled regions, accuracy will degrade despite reduced latency.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: VALO mitigates accuracy loss from partial input processing through lightweight object forecasting.
- Mechanism: VALO maintains a queue of previously detected object poses and updates their positions to the current time using a simple physics model based on velocity and ego-vehicle movement. These forecasted objects are merged with DNN-detected objects through non-maximum suppression.
- Core assumption: Object motion between consecutive LiDAR scans is limited enough that simple physics-based forecasting provides reasonable pose estimates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it leverages efficient forecasting of past detection results to mitigate possible loss of accuracy due to partial processing of input."
  - [section] "For effective region scheduling, V ALO predicts execution times of subsequent network stages of each possible region selection."
- Break condition: If objects move erratically or the forecasting model's assumptions about constant velocity are violated, forecasted poses will be inaccurate, reducing the effectiveness of this mechanism.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: VALO reduces redundant computation in detection heads without accuracy loss through input reduction.
- Mechanism: Instead of applying convolutions to all parts of the input, VALO first computes the heatmap to identify object proposals, then selectively gathers and batches small patches from the input tensor corresponding to these proposals. Convolutions are applied only to these relevant patches.
- Core assumption: Most of the input volume in detection heads contains no objects, so computing on the full volume is wasteful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, it utilizes a novel input reduction technique within its detection heads to significantly accelerate execution without sacrificing accuracy."
  - [section] "This optimization ensures that convolutions are applied only to the data that is needed for producing the desired output corresponding to the locations in R."
- Break condition: If the object distribution changes such that many small objects appear in previously empty regions, the selective approach may miss some detections or require processing larger patches, reducing efficiency gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: LiDAR point cloud representation and voxelization
  - Why needed here: VALO operates at the voxel level for scheduling decisions and relies on understanding how point clouds are transformed into sparse tensors for efficient processing.
  - Quick check question: How does converting point clouds to voxels enable the use of sparse convolutions, and why is this more efficient than dense convolutions for LiDAR data?

- Concept: Sparse convolution operation and execution time variability
- Why needed here: VALO's execution time prediction for the 3D backbone depends on understanding how sparse convolutions generate different output voxel counts based on input voxel positions.
- Quick check question: Why does the same number of input voxels produce different execution times for sparse convolutions depending on their relative positions, and how does VALO address this variability?

- Concept: Anytime algorithms and contract algorithms
  - Why needed here: VALO transforms LiDAR object detection into a contract algorithm that delivers results within predetermined time budgets with controlled accuracy tradeoffs.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes anytime algorithms from contract algorithms, and why is the contract algorithm model appropriate for real-time autonomous driving scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Region scheduler: Partitions detection area into vertical regions and selects subsets based on deadline constraints
  - Execution time predictor: Uses history-based approach to predict 3D backbone execution time from input voxel counts
  - Forecasting module: Maintains queue of previous object poses and updates positions using physics model
  - Detection head optimizer: Implements selective convolution on object-relevant patches instead of full input volume
  - Non-maximum suppression: Combines forecasted and DNN-detected objects for final output

- Critical path: Feature transform → Region scheduling → 3D backbone → 2D backbone → Detection head optimization → Forecasting → Non-maximum suppression

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Scheduling granularity: Finer partitioning enables more precise deadline control but increases scheduling overhead
  - Forecasting accuracy vs. computational cost: More sophisticated models could improve accuracy but would increase overhead
  - Region selection policy: Greedy approach is simple but may not always find optimal region combinations

- Failure signatures:
  - High deadline miss rates despite region scheduling: Likely indicates inaccurate execution time prediction or overly aggressive deadline constraints
  - Significant accuracy degradation when using tight deadlines: May indicate forecasting model inadequacy or insufficient spatial coverage from scheduled regions
  - Unexpected GPU underutilization: Could indicate suboptimal batching in detection head optimization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Profile execution times of CenterPoint components on target hardware to validate the time prediction model assumptions
  2. Test region scheduling with varying deadline constraints to observe the relationship between scheduled regions and detection accuracy
  3. Evaluate forecasting accuracy by comparing forecasted object poses against ground truth positions in subsequent frames

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does VALO's performance scale when applied to different LiDAR point cloud resolutions or densities, particularly in sparse urban environments versus dense environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions VALO's versatility across different DNN architectures but does not explicitly test different LiDAR point cloud resolutions or densities.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation uses a fixed nuScenes dataset with standard point cloud characteristics, but does not explore performance variations across different point cloud densities or resolutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative performance metrics of VALO across datasets with varying point cloud densities and resolutions, showing accuracy-latency tradeoffs in different environmental conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of VALO's forecasting mechanism on accuracy when object motion patterns deviate significantly from the simple physics model assumptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that forecasting uses a simple physics model to predict object poses but does not explore scenarios where objects exhibit non-linear or complex motion patterns.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation uses real-world driving data where object motions are generally predictable, but does not test edge cases with sudden direction changes or acceleration/deceleration patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Accuracy degradation metrics when objects exhibit non-linear motion patterns, and comparison of forecasting accuracy with more sophisticated prediction models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does VALO's region scheduling algorithm perform when LiDAR point clouds are unevenly distributed across the detection area, such as when objects cluster in specific regions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The scheduling algorithm assumes equal priority across all regions and processes adjacent regions together, but does not explicitly address scenarios with highly non-uniform point cloud distributions.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation uses general driving scenarios but does not specifically test cases where objects cluster in specific regions of the detection area.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance comparison of VALO's scheduling algorithm versus alternative strategies (like priority-based scheduling) in scenarios with highly non-uniform object distributions.

## Limitations
- VALO is validated only on nuScenes dataset with CenterPoint and VoxelNext architectures on a single hardware platform (Jetson AGX Xavier)
- Forecasting mechanism relies on simple physics-based updates without incorporating environmental factors like traffic patterns or object interactions
- Input reduction technique's efficiency gains depend on the assumption that detection heads contain significant empty space, which may not hold for scenes with dense object distributions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The anytime computing mechanism through region scheduling and the forecasting approach for pose updates are technically sound and well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The generality of VALO across different LiDAR detection architectures and datasets is claimed but not fully validated.
- **Low confidence**: The long-term stability and effectiveness of the forecasting mechanism in scenarios with high object density, occlusion, or complex motion patterns is not thoroughly evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Evaluate VALO on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset to assess performance consistency across different data distributions and scene complexities.
2. **Hardware platform expansion**: Test VALO on different edge platforms (e.g., Nvidia Orin, Intel Xeon) and compare scheduling overhead and accuracy-latency tradeoffs to validate hardware independence.
3. **Forecasting accuracy analysis**: Conduct ablation studies isolating the forecasting contribution by comparing detection accuracy with and without forecasting under various object density and motion patterns.
