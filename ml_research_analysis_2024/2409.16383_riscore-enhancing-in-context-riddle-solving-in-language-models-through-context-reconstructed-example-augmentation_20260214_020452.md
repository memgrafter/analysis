# RISCORE: Enhancing In-Context Riddle Solving in Language Models through Context-Reconstructed Example Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16383
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RISCORE improves riddle-solving performance by up to 4% over semantic similarity-based few-shot methods

## Executive Summary
RISCORE is a fully automated prompting method that enhances in-context riddle-solving in language models by augmenting few-shot exemplars with contextually reconstructed examples. The method addresses the challenge that semantically similar examples may have different reasoning processes by generating new riddles that preserve the original reasoning while altering context. RISCORE combines these context-reconstructed riddles with original examples as few-shot demonstrations, showing consistent performance improvements across multiple models and datasets compared to traditional few-shot approaches.

## Method Summary
RISCORE operates through a three-stage process: first, it selects semantically similar exemplars from the training set using similarity metrics; second, it generates context-reconstructed riddles that preserve the original reasoning patterns while altering the contextual framing; and third, it combines both original and reconstructed examples as few-shot demonstrations. The context reconstruction leverages LLMs to generate new riddles that maintain the same logical relationship between question and answer but in different contextual settings. The method is designed to prioritize reasoning similarity over semantic similarity, helping models learn abstract reasoning patterns rather than memorizing surface-level features.

## Key Results
- RISCORE achieves up to 4% improvement over semantically similar exemplar selection on BrainTeaser dataset
- Demonstrates 2-2.5% gains on RiddleSense compared to standard few-shot approaches
- Consistently outperforms traditional few-shot methods across multiple models including Llama3-70B, Llama3-8B, Mistral-8x7B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2-7B
- Effectively mitigates noise from suboptimal shot selections while maintaining or improving reasoning performance with fewer examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Context-reconstructed examples help the model isolate reasoning patterns by removing semantic distractions.
- Mechanism: By generating riddles that preserve the same logical relationship between question and answer but in a different contextual framing, the model can learn to recognize the abstract reasoning structure rather than memorizing surface-level semantic features.
- Core assumption: The reasoning process underlying a riddle is independent of its specific contextual framing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RISCORE generates context-reconstructed riddles that maintain the original reasoning while altering context"
  - [section 3.1] "although these riddles are semantically similar, follow the same structure, and refer to the same objects, their reasoning processes differ"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on evaluation of reasoning but don't specifically address context reconstruction as a prompting technique
- Break condition: If the reasoning process is inherently tied to the specific context (e.g., cultural references that can't be abstracted), the context-reconstruction will fail to preserve the reasoning pattern.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RISCORE reduces noise from suboptimal exemplar selection by combining semantically similar examples with their context-reconstructed counterparts.
- Mechanism: When exemplar selection is imperfect (semantic similarity doesn't perfectly capture reasoning similarity), the context-reconstructed example provides an alternative path to the same reasoning pattern, increasing the chances that at least one exemplar will properly guide the model.
- Core assumption: Even when semantic similarity fails to select optimal exemplars, the corresponding context-reconstructed example will provide the correct reasoning path.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "RISCORE effectively mitigates the noise introduced by suboptimal shot selections" and shows performance improvements when adding context-reconstructed examples to semantically similar ones
  - [section 5.1] "With the Llama3-70B model, the 2-shot FS Sim achieves a performance score of 0.825. However, adding two more semantically similar examples reduces the score to 0.792. In contrast, the 2+2-shot RISCOREm achieves a score of 0.833—a 4% improvement over FS Sim"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence directly supports this specific noise-reduction mechanism
- Break condition: If semantic similarity is extremely poor at selecting exemplars (e.g., selecting riddles with completely different reasoning patterns), context reconstruction won't compensate for fundamentally wrong exemplar choices.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RISCORE enables reasoning transfer by showing the model multiple contextual instantiations of the same abstract pattern.
- Mechanism: By presenting both the original riddle and its context-reconstructed version, the model learns to recognize that the underlying reasoning pattern is invariant across different contexts, improving its ability to apply this pattern to new, unseen riddles.
- Core assumption: LLMs can learn abstract reasoning patterns through exposure to multiple concrete instances.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "Incorporating such reconstructed instances as few-shot exemplars, together with their original counterparts, offers an alternative few-shot strategy that prioritizes reasoning similarity and analogy"
  - [section 5.1] "RISCORE m demonstrates superior performance" and "RISCORE consistently enhances performance by effectively leveraging reconstructed contexts"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on reasoning evaluation but don't provide evidence about pattern transfer through multiple instantiations
- Break condition: If the model cannot abstract patterns from multiple instances (e.g., due to insufficient model capacity or training), providing multiple contextual versions won't improve reasoning transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic vs reasoning similarity distinction
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly distinguishes between semantically similar examples that may have different reasoning processes versus examples that share reasoning patterns but differ semantically
  - Quick check question: Given "A man shaves everyday, yet keeps his beard long" and "Tom attends class every day but doesn't do any homework", are these semantically similar or reasoning-similar?

- Concept: In-context learning and exemplar selection
  - Why needed here: RISCORE builds on few-shot learning by modifying how exemplars are selected and augmented
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between random exemplar selection and semantic similarity-based selection in few-shot prompting?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting limitations
  - Why needed here: The paper compares RISCORE against CoT methods and finds it superior in some cases
  - Quick check question: Why might Chain-of-Thought prompting underperform compared to well-designed few-shot approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input dataset -> Exemplar selection module -> Context reconstruction engine -> Quality filtering -> Prompt assembly -> Model inference
- Critical path: Exemplar selection → Context reconstruction → Quality filtering → Prompt assembly → Model inference
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Quality vs quantity: Higher quality context reconstructions improve performance but are harder to generate
  - Model size impact: Larger models generate better reconstructions but require more resources
  - Semantic similarity vs reasoning similarity: Semantic similarity is easier to compute but may not perfectly align with reasoning needs
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor exemplar selection leading to irrelevant reasoning patterns
  - Low-quality context reconstructions that don't preserve the original reasoning
  - Overfitting to specific contexts rather than learning abstract patterns
  - Computational constraints limiting the number of context reconstructions that can be generated
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate context reconstructions for a small subset of BrainTeaser riddles using both zero-shot and few-shot LLM approaches, compare quality manually
  2. Test whether combining original and reconstructed examples improves performance compared to original examples alone on a small validation set
  3. Evaluate different exemplar selection strategies (random vs semantic similarity) with and without context reconstruction to isolate the impact of each component

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset specificity: Evaluation focuses exclusively on two riddle datasets, limiting generalizability to other reasoning tasks
- Reconstruction quality dependency: Method's effectiveness depends heavily on quality of context reconstructions, which isn't systematically quantified
- LLM dependency: Context reconstruction relies on LLMs themselves, creating potential circularity in evaluation
- Semantic similarity limitations: Paper doesn't explore performance with deliberately poor exemplar selections or alternative selection strategies

## Confidence

**Claim 1: RISCORE improves riddle-solving performance over traditional few-shot methods** - **High confidence**
The experimental results show consistent improvements across multiple models and datasets, with specific performance metrics provided.

**Claim 2: Context-reconstructed examples help isolate reasoning patterns by removing semantic distractions** - **Medium confidence**
While the mechanism is plausible and results support this claim, there's limited direct evidence showing models learn abstract reasoning patterns.

**Claim 3: RISCORE mitigates noise from suboptimal exemplar selection** - **Medium confidence**
Paper demonstrates improved performance when adding context-reconstructed examples, but doesn't systematically test with increasingly poor exemplar selections.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate RISCORE on reasoning tasks outside the riddle domain (e.g., mathematical word problems, logical puzzles) to assess generalizability of the context reconstruction approach.

2. **Reconstruction quality analysis**: Systematically measure the success rate of context reconstructions by having human evaluators rate whether reconstructed riddles preserve the original reasoning pattern, and analyze how reconstruction quality correlates with performance gains.

3. **Ablation study on exemplar selection**: Test RISCORE with different exemplar selection strategies ranging from optimal to deliberately poor choices to quantify how much the method compensates for suboptimal selections versus simply adding more examples.
