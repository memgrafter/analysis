# SEER: Self-Aligned Evidence Extraction for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.11315
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11315
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 13.5% improvement in QA accuracy over FILCO on NQ dataset while reducing evidence length by 9.25x

## Executive Summary
SEER introduces a self-aligned learning framework to address evidence extraction challenges in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The method optimizes a vanilla model as an evidence extractor through response sampling, expert assessment, and listwise-aware Lambda Preference Optimization (LPO). By leveraging model-based augmentation and smoothing CoV-weighted scoring, SEER achieves significant improvements in faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness of extracted evidence while demonstrating robustness against noisy passages.

## Method Summary
SEER employs a three-stage pipeline for self-aligned evidence extraction. First, it generates multiple candidate evidence passages through response sampling from a base extractor, removing duplicates and ensuring uniform distribution. Second, three experts assess the quality of evidence based on faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness, with scores weighted using a smoothing CoV-weighting schema to obtain an overall assessment. Finally, the base extractor is optimized via listwise-aware Lambda Preference Optimization (LPO) that considers ranking positions of evidence samples. This self-alignment process enhances the quality of extracted evidence while reducing its length significantly compared to baselines.

## Key Results
- Achieves 13.5% improvement in QA accuracy over FILCO on NQ dataset
- Reduces evidence length by 9.25x compared to FILCO
- Demonstrates robustness to noise with consistent performance across varying noise-to-signal ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Model-based augmentation produces more contextually relevant evidence than heuristic-based augmentation. Response sampling from the base extractor generates multiple candidate evidence passages, filtered to remove duplicates and retain uniformly distributed samples. This allows exploration of a wider range of evidence variations and selection of the most contextually relevant ones. Core assumption: The base extractor can generate diverse evidence samples more contextually relevant than heuristic-based methods. Evidence shows context relevance of Upper Model-based Aug is consistently higher than StrInc Heur-based Aug.

### Mechanism 2
SEER's self-alignment process improves faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness of extracted evidence. Three experts assess evidence quality, with scores weighted using smoothing CoV-weighting to obtain an overall assessment score. This score optimizes the base extractor via listwise-aware Lambda Preference Optimization (LPO), which considers ranking position of evidence samples. Core assumption: Experts accurately assess quality and CoV-weighting effectively balances learning difficulty. Experimental results show extensive improvements in final RAG performance and evidence quality.

### Mechanism 3
SEER demonstrates robustness to noise from irrelevant passages. The self-alignment process and CoV-weighting help the model focus on most relevant evidence even in presence of noise. The model learns to prioritize evidence that is more contextually relevant and less affected by irrelevant passages. Core assumption: Self-alignment and CoV-weighting effectively mitigate noise impact. Experimental results show the aligned extractor consistently outperforms the base under varying noise-to-signal ratios.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Combines large language models with external knowledge retrieval to improve response quality. Needed as foundation for SEER framework. Quick check: What is the main advantage of using RAG over traditional language models?
- **Preference optimization**: Fine-tunes models based on quality assessments rather than traditional supervised learning. Used to improve evidence extraction quality. Quick check: What is the difference between preference optimization and traditional supervised learning?
- **Self-alignment**: Allows models to improve themselves by leveraging generated evidence and assessing its quality. Key component enabling SEER's effectiveness. Quick check: How does self-alignment differ from traditional alignment methods that rely on human feedback?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Evidence Extraction Stage -> Expert Assessment Stage -> Self-Alignment Stage
- **Critical path**: Data flows from evidence extraction through expert assessment to self-alignment. Final evidence quality depends on effectiveness of each pipeline stage.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Limited base extractor capacity may produce less diverse evidence; expert choice significantly impacts assessment quality; LPO effectiveness depends on preference data quality.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor context relevance indicates evidence extraction or base extractor issues; inconsistent quality across criteria suggests expert assessment problems; limited improvement after self-alignment indicates LPO or preference data issues.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate context relevance of evidence samples from base extractor using response sampling vs heuristic-based augmentation
  2. Assess evidence quality using three experts with CoV-weighting; analyze impact of different weighting schemes
  3. Fine-tune base extractor using LPO; evaluate quality improvement and compare with other preference optimization methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations

- Effectiveness heavily depends on base extractor quality and expert assessment accuracy
- Lacks direct corpus evidence for CoV-weighting schema and LPO method effectiveness
- Experimental robustness demonstration not directly supported by corpus evidence

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: 13.5% QA accuracy improvement over FILCO on NQ dataset; 9.25x evidence length reduction
- **Medium confidence**: Enhanced faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness claims supported by experimental setup but not direct corpus evidence
- **Low confidence**: Robustness to noise demonstrated experimentally but lacking direct corpus evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus Evidence Validation**: Gather direct corpus evidence for CoV-weighting and LPO effectiveness by analyzing impact of different weighting schemes and optimization methods across large datasets
2. **Base Extractor Capacity Assessment**: Evaluate different base extractors' capacity to generate diverse, contextually relevant evidence samples through comparative performance analysis
3. **Noise Robustness Testing**: Design systematic study varying noise-to-signal ratios in retrieved passages to directly measure SEER's robustness compared to base extractor across controlled noise conditions
