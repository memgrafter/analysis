# IntellBot: Retrieval Augmented LLM Chatbot for Cyber Threat Knowledge Delivery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05442
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05442
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: Cyber security chatbot achieving BERT score above 0.8 and cosine similarity scores ranging from 0.8 to 1

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IntellBot, a cyber security chatbot that leverages Large Language Models and Langchain with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to deliver threat intelligence. The system gathers information from diverse data sources including cyber security books, APT reports, vulnerability databases, and security blogs to create a comprehensive knowledge base. The chatbot provides tailored responses to cyber security queries and serves as a primary hub for cyber security insights. Performance evaluation using a two-stage strategy demonstrates high accuracy with BERT scores above 0.8 and cosine similarity scores between 0.8-1.

## Method Summary
The IntellBot system collects cyber security data from multiple sources including 445 cyber security books, 2,002 APT reports, 7,989 malicious file hashes, and various vulnerability and security blog datasets. The data undergoes preprocessing through document loading and text splitting before being converted to numerical embeddings using sentence-transformers and OpenAI models. These embeddings are stored in separate FAISS vector stores for different data types, with an ensemble retriever combining outputs. The chatbot interface is built using Streamlit with prompt-based responses, and performance is evaluated using a two-stage approach measuring BERT scores and cosine similarity between bot-generated responses and human-curated answers.

## Key Results
- Achieved BERT score above 0.8 through indirect approach comparing bot questions to original queries
- Obtained cosine similarity scores ranging from 0.8 to 1 when comparing bot responses to human answers
- RAGAS evaluation showed all metrics consistently above 0.77, confirming the efficacy of the RAG approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves chatbot response accuracy by combining a language model with context from external documents.
- Mechanism: The system retrieves relevant documents using vector similarity (FAISS) and passes them as context to the LLM, which then generates a response grounded in those documents.
- Core assumption: The retrieved documents are sufficiently relevant and comprehensive to answer the query.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and emerging threats."
  - [section 3.2] "RAG ensures that responses generated by an LLM are not solely dependent on static or outdated training data."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence of RAG's performance from related work.
- Break condition: Retrieved documents are irrelevant, incomplete, or outdated, leading to inaccurate responses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-stage evaluation strategy (indirect proof and cosine similarity) validates the accuracy of the chatbot's responses.
- Mechanism: First, the system generates bot questions from the response and compares their similarity to the original query (BERT score). Second, it compares the bot's response to a human-curated answer using cosine similarity (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT embeddings).
- Core assumption: High similarity scores indicate correct responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.8] "We achieved BERT score above 0.8 by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which affirms the accuracy of our copilot."
  - [section 5.1] "Our findings show that in the first stage, we achieved a BERT score greater than 0.8 and consistently obtained cosine similarity scores ranging from 0.8 to 1."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence of this evaluation strategy from related work.
- Break condition: Low similarity scores, indicating incorrect or irrelevant responses.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LangChain simplifies the development of LLM-based applications by providing a modular framework for working with LLMs.
- Mechanism: LangChain abstracts the complexities of LLM operations, such as loading models, tokenizing input, and managing conversational context.
- Core assumption: LangChain's abstractions are effective and efficient for building chatbot applications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "Langchain provides a range of fundamental tools for loading and managing LLM models from different sources, tokenizing input text, batching requests, and managing other common LLM operations."
  - [section 3.1] "Furthermore, LangChain offers advanced tools for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs, which are particularly beneficial in the context of a cyber security chatbot."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence of LangChain's effectiveness from related work.
- Break condition: LangChain's abstractions are insufficient or introduce performance bottlenecks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector embeddings
  - Why needed here: To represent text data in a numerical format for efficient similarity search and retrieval.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of converting text into numerical vectors in the context of this chatbot?
- Concept: Cosine similarity
  - Why needed here: To measure the semantic similarity between the bot's response and a human-curated answer.
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity help evaluate the accuracy of the chatbot's responses?
- Concept: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  - Why needed here: To improve the accuracy and relevance of the chatbot's responses by combining a language model with context from external documents.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using RAG over a standalone language model for this chatbot?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Collection -> Document Loading -> Text Splitting -> Text Embedding -> Vector Store -> Similarity Search -> Response Generation -> Evaluation
- Critical path: User query -> Similarity Search -> Retrieved documents -> LLM response generation -> Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using FAISS for vector storage prioritizes query performance over storage efficiency; using multiple embedding techniques (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) provides a more robust evaluation but increases computational cost.
- Failure signatures: Low BERT scores or cosine similarity scores indicate inaccurate or irrelevant responses; slow response times may indicate performance bottlenecks in the vector store or LLM operations.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the chatbot with a simple query and verify that it retrieves relevant documents and generates a coherent response.
  2. Evaluate the chatbot's response to a query using the two-stage evaluation strategy and verify that the similarity scores are above the expected thresholds.
  3. Measure the response time for various query types and identify potential performance bottlenecks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the system handle ambiguous or incomplete user queries in cybersecurity contexts, and what fallback mechanisms are in place when retrieved documents are insufficient?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the chatbot's ability to handle diverse queries and adapt to conversational contexts, but does not explicitly address ambiguity handling or fallback mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The methodology section outlines the chatbot's architecture and evaluation but lacks details on query ambiguity resolution or handling insufficient document retrieval.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the chatbot's performance on ambiguous or incomplete queries, and documentation of fallback strategies when retrieval yields insufficient results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different embedding models (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) on the chatbot's performance in various cybersecurity domains, and which model is most effective overall?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates cosine similarity using Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT embeddings, but does not compare their impact on overall chatbot performance across different cybersecurity domains.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides cosine similarity scores, it does not analyze the effectiveness of each embedding model in specific cybersecurity contexts or their overall impact on chatbot performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of chatbot performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, relevance) using different embedding models across various cybersecurity domains, with clear identification of the most effective model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the chatbot's performance scale with increasing data volume, and what are the computational costs associated with maintaining and querying large knowledge bases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the creation of a comprehensive knowledge base but does not discuss scalability or computational costs associated with handling large datasets.
- Why unresolved: The methodology and experimental results focus on the chatbot's accuracy and relevance but do not address scalability challenges or computational resource requirements as the knowledge base grows.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks showing the chatbot's response time and accuracy as the knowledge base size increases, along with analysis of computational costs (e.g., memory usage, processing time) for maintaining and querying the system.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on similarity-based validation without human-grounded error analysis
- Limited transparency in test case selection and absence of error analysis for evaluation results
- No evidence of real-world deployment or user testing to validate practical utility claims

## Confidence

- High confidence in the technical implementation of RAG and LangChain components
- Medium confidence in evaluation results due to limited transparency in test case selection and absence of error analysis
- Low confidence in claims about practical utility without evidence of real-world deployment or user testing

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a human evaluation study where security analysts assess the chatbot's responses to real-world threat intelligence queries, comparing its performance against traditional research methods
2. Test the system's performance with adversarial queries designed to elicit incorrect or misleading responses, measuring false positive and false negative rates
3. Evaluate the system's response time and resource utilization under concurrent usage scenarios to assess scalability and practical deployment viability
