# Deceptive Diffusion: Generating Synthetic Adversarial Examples

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.19807
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19807
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Deceptive diffusion generates synthetic adversarial examples with 93.6% misclassification rate, closely matching original attack patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces deceptive diffusion, a novel approach for generating synthetic adversarial examples using diffusion models. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that perturb existing images, deceptive diffusion trains generative models on adversarially perturbed images to produce entirely new, misclassified images. The method offers a scalable way to generate adversarial training data and reveals a concerning vulnerability: diffusion models trained on partially poisoned data produce misleading outputs in proportion to the poisoning level. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that images generated by a deceptive diffusion model achieve a 93.6% misclassification rate when trained on 86.5% successfully attacked images, closely mirroring the attack patterns of the original adversarial attack algorithm.

## Method Summary
Deceptive diffusion works by first applying an adversarial attack to images in the training dataset, creating perturbed versions that fool a target classifier. A diffusion model is then trained on this adversarially perturbed dataset. During inference, the diffusion model generates entirely new images that inherit the misclassification properties of the training data without being direct perturbations of any specific image. The approach is evaluated using the MNIST dataset, where the diffusion model learns to generate new digit images that are consistently misclassified by the target classifier. The study also investigates data poisoning by training diffusion models on mixtures of clean and adversarially attacked images, revealing that the proportion of misleading generated outputs directly corresponds to the proportion of poisoned training data.

## Key Results
- Deceptive diffusion achieves 93.6% misclassification rate on generated MNIST images
- Generated images closely mirror the attack patterns of the original adversarial attack algorithm
- Class-Aware Fréchet Distance increases linearly with poisoning level, confirming model's ability to mimic adversarially attacked data
- Diffusion models trained on partially poisoned data produce misleading outputs in direct proportion to poisoning ratio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works because diffusion models learn the statistical distribution of their training data through a denoising process. When trained on adversarially attacked images, the model learns to generate images that fall within the distribution of misclassified examples rather than the true data distribution. The iterative denoising process allows the model to capture subtle patterns that cause misclassification while still producing visually plausible images. This approach bypasses the need for optimization at inference time, as the model directly generates misclassified examples without requiring gradient computations against the target classifier.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Why needed - generate high-quality synthetic images through iterative denoising; Quick check - verify stable training on MNIST
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Why needed - create training data that causes misclassification; Quick check - confirm 86.5% attack success rate
- **Fréchet Distance**: Why needed - quantify distributional similarity between generated and target data; Quick check - observe linear relationship with poisoning level
- **Data Poisoning**: Why needed - understand vulnerability when training on compromised data; Quick check - verify proportion of misleading outputs matches poisoning ratio
- **Generative Adversarial Training**: Why needed - create robust models resistant to adversarial examples; Quick check - test classification accuracy on deceptive diffusion outputs
- **Distribution Learning**: Why needed - diffusion models must capture the statistical properties of adversarial examples; Quick check - compare generated samples to training distribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Deceptive Diffusion Model <- (Trained on) <- Adversarially Attacked Images <- (Generated by) <- Adversarial Attack Algorithm -> Target Classifier

**Critical Path**
1. Apply adversarial attack to training images
2. Train diffusion model on attacked images
3. Generate new images from diffusion model
4. Evaluate misclassification rate on target classifier

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Training diffusion models requires significant computational resources but enables generation of unlimited adversarial examples
- The approach trades real-time computation (required by traditional attacks) for up-front training costs
- Model quality depends heavily on the diversity and quality of the adversarially attacked training data

**Failure Signatures**
- Generated images that are visually implausible or clearly corrupted
- Misclassification rates that deviate significantly from the training attack success rate
- Class-Aware Fréchet Distance that doesn't scale linearly with poisoning level
- Diffusion model that fails to converge or produces mode collapse

**3 First Experiments**
1. Train a diffusion model on clean MNIST images and verify it generates recognizable digits
2. Apply FGSM attack to MNIST test set and confirm target classifier misclassification
3. Train a basic diffusion model on the adversarially attacked images and measure initial misclassification rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to MNIST dataset, which is simpler than real-world image domains
- Only considers binary poisoning scenarios (clean vs. attacked images)
- Computational overhead of training diffusion models not compared to traditional methods
- Single poisoning strategy used, may not capture full complexity of real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core methodology and MNIST experimental results
- Medium confidence: Generalization to more complex datasets
- Medium confidence: Data poisoning vulnerability findings

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on CIFAR-10 or ImageNet to assess scalability to more complex image domains
2. Test multiple adversarial attack methods (e.g., PGD, CW) to verify consistent results across attack types
3. Implement real-time comparison of computational costs between deceptive diffusion and traditional adversarial example generation methods
