# Advancing Ante-Hoc Explainable Models through Generative Adversarial Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04647
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04647
- Reference count: 14
- One-line primary result: GAN-based ante-hoc explainable model achieves 91.82% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 65.49% on CIFAR-100 with interpretable concept visualizations.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an ante-hoc explainable model for visual classification that incorporates a GAN to learn visual concepts. The method augments a classifier with a concept encoder and GAN-based generator/discriminator, jointly trained to align internally learned concepts with human-interpretable visual properties. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show improved classification accuracy and auxiliary accuracy over baselines, with the best model achieving 91.82% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 65.49% on CIFAR-100. Concept visualizations demonstrate coherent activations corresponding to object parts and attributes. The GAN integration and noise sampling methods enhance concept learning and image generation quality. This work presents a significant step towards building inherently interpretable deep vision models with task-aligned concept representations.

## Method Summary
The proposed method appends a GAN-based explanation module to a visual classifier, creating an ante-hoc explainable model. The architecture consists of a base encoder, concept encoder, GAN generator (with noise input), discriminator, classifier, and concept classifier. All components are jointly trained using classification, reconstruction, fidelity, and GAN losses. The model learns to map images to interpretable visual concepts that both predict class labels and enable image reconstruction through the GAN. Noise sampling strategies (DAN, ICN, PCN) and conditional GAN variants are explored to enhance concept learning and generation quality.

## Key Results
- Best model achieves 91.82% classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 65.49% on CIFAR-100
- Auxiliary accuracy (concept-based prediction) reaches 90.84% on CIFAR-10 and 59.83% on CIFAR-100
- GAN integration increases training time by 1.4x compared to baseline but improves concept quality and classification accuracy
- Concept visualizations show coherent activations corresponding to object parts and attributes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The GAN integration enlarges the feature space available to the generator, enabling richer concept learning.
- Mechanism: By feeding both the concept encodings and noise sampled from a normal distribution into the generator, the model can explore a broader space of possible image reconstructions, which in turn forces the concept encoder to capture more informative and diverse visual properties.
- Core assumption: The additional randomness from noise, combined with structured concept inputs, creates a more expressive latent space that better aligns with human-interpretable visual concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This choice effectively enlarges the feature space available to the generator."
  - [section] "Although this increases model complexity, it helps capture richer concepts that can be validated from the figures."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus about GAN-driven concept space expansion.
- Break condition: If the noise overwhelms the concept signal, the generator may fail to learn meaningful mappings, degrading both classification and interpretability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Label conditioning in cGAN improves concept alignment with class-relevant visual attributes.
- Mechanism: By incorporating class labels as conditioning information, the generator learns to produce images that are not only realistic but also semantically consistent with the target class, which reinforces the concept encoder to extract attributes that are discriminative and class-specific.
- Core assumption: Conditioning on labels guides the adversarial training to focus on class-relevant visual features, leading to more coherent concept visualizations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We conduct experiments on Vanilla GAN and cGAN to assess the impact of label conditioning on our framework."
  - [section] "While cGAN leverages labels as an additional input parameter to control the generation of the image."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on concept bottleneck models but do not explicitly compare cGAN vs vanilla GAN conditioning effects.
- Break condition: If labels are noisy or irrelevant, conditioning may introduce bias, leading to misaligned or misleading concepts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different noise sampling strategies (DAN, ICN, PCN) affect how well concepts capture visual semantics.
- Mechanism: The way noise is sampled and combined with concepts changes the statistical properties of the input to the generator, which influences the diversity and quality of reconstructed images, thereby shaping the concept encoder's learning trajectory.
- Core assumption: Structured noise sampling preserves some statistical properties (e.g., Gaussian) that aid stable training, while varied sampling methods allow exploration of different latent manifolds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We show that introducing noise improves model adaptability, enhancing image quality and overall model efficiency."
  - [section] "Different noise generation strategies are explored. The noise sampled helped us in determining the effects of different noise perturbations on our model."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus focuses on concept bottleneck models but does not address noise sampling strategies in GAN-based frameworks.
- Break condition: If noise sampling introduces instability or breaks the Gaussian assumption, training may diverge or produce incoherent concepts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: GANs provide a mechanism for generating realistic images from learned concepts, enabling the model to enforce that concepts capture meaningful visual semantics.
  - Quick check question: What are the two core components of a GAN and what are their respective roles?

- Concept: Concept Bottleneck Models
  - Why needed here: These models explicitly model human-understandable concepts as intermediate layers, enabling both interpretability and task performance to be optimized jointly.
  - Quick check question: How do concept bottleneck models differ from post-hoc explanation methods in terms of training integration?

- Concept: Conditional Generation
  - Why needed here: Conditioning the generator on class labels ensures that generated images are semantically consistent with the target class, improving concept alignment.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using conditional GANs over vanilla GANs in a classification setting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Base encoder H(.) → Concept encoder Λ(.) → Concept generator G(.) + Noise → Image reconstruction → Discriminator D(.)
  - Classifier Θ(.) and concept classifier T(.) share concepts from Λ(.)
  - Losses: classification (Lc), reconstruction (LR), fidelity (LF), GAN (LG)

- Critical path:
  1. Input image → H(.) → Λ(.) → concepts
  2. Concepts + noise → G(.) → generated image
  3. Real vs generated image → D(.)
  4. Concepts → T(.) and Θ(.) → predictions
  5. Compute all losses and backpropagate jointly

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Adding GAN increases model complexity and training time (~1.4x) but improves concept quality and classification accuracy.
  - Noise sampling methods balance between exploration (diversity) and stability (Gaussian assumptions).
  - Label conditioning improves semantic alignment but may introduce bias if labels are noisy.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor classification accuracy: concepts not discriminative enough.
  - Uninterpretable concept visualizations: concepts not aligned with human visual attributes.
  - Training instability: GAN loss oscillations, mode collapse, or noisy reconstructions.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline (Sarkar et al. 2021) on CIFAR-10 without GAN; record accuracy and concept quality.
  2. Add vanilla GAN with DAN noise; compare accuracy, auxiliary accuracy, and concept visualizations.
  3. Replace vanilla GAN with cGAN; evaluate impact of label conditioning on both metrics and concept coherence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Model architecture details are not fully specified, leaving key design choices to reader interpretation.
- Noise sampling mechanisms are mentioned but exact procedures and impact on training dynamics are not detailed.
- Loss weight tuning is not explicitly provided, which could significantly affect performance.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The overall framework design (concept encoder + GAN + classifier) is well-justified by existing ante-hoc XAI literature.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about GAN-driven concept space expansion are supported by experimental results but lack direct mechanistic evidence.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that label conditioning consistently improves concept alignment across all datasets and classes is based on limited ablation studies.

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture fidelity test**: Implement the model with multiple plausible GAN architectures (DCGAN, SAGAN variants) and compare concept quality and classification performance to isolate the effect of architectural choices.

2. **Noise sampling ablation**: Systematically vary noise sampling strategies (DAN, ICN, PCN) and quantify their impact on concept diversity, image reconstruction quality, and training stability using controlled experiments.

3. **Label conditioning robustness**: Evaluate the model on datasets with varying label quality (e.g., CIFAR-10 vs. CIFAR-100 vs. noisy-labeled variants) to assess whether label conditioning consistently improves concept alignment or introduces bias.
