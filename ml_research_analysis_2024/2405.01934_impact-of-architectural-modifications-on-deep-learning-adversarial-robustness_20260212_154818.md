# Impact of Architectural Modifications on Deep Learning Adversarial Robustness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.01934
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01934
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: Architectural improvements like residual connections and squeeze-and-excitation modules can enhance robustness to adversarial attacks, while batch normalization may reduce it.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates how architectural modifications in deep learning models affect their robustness against adversarial attacks. Using white-box attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W) on VGG, Inception, and MobileNet architectures, the research reveals that architectural improvements such as residual connections, factorization, bottleneck designs, and squeeze-and-excitation modules generally enhance model robustness. The study found that batch normalization, while improving standard performance metrics, can negatively impact robustness, particularly in VGG models. MobileNet V3, which incorporates these architectural improvements, demonstrated superior robustness compared to its predecessor, MobileNet V2, highlighting the importance of careful architectural design for safety-critical applications.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted experiments using pre-trained models on the ImageNet dataset, specifically selecting 1000 test images (one per class, correctly classified by all models). They evaluated three white-box adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W) on variations of VGG, Inception, and MobileNet architectures. The study measured attack success rate, attack time, and noise rate (1-SSIM) to assess robustness. Key architectural modifications examined included batch normalization layers, residual connections, factorization techniques, bottleneck designs, and squeeze-and-excitation modules. The experiments were conducted on PyTorch framework using specific hardware configurations (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2620 v3, GTX Titan X GPUs).

## Key Results
- Batch normalization improves standard performance but can reduce robustness to adversarial attacks, as demonstrated in VGG models
- Architectural improvements including residual connections, factorization, bottleneck designs, and squeeze-and-excitation modules enhance model robustness
- MobileNet V3, incorporating multiple architectural improvements, demonstrated superior robustness compared to MobileNet V2
- Increasing model depth (number of layers) in VGG architectures led to improved robustness to adversarial attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improved robustness in architectures with residual connections stems from their ability to preserve information flow through skip connections, making it harder for adversarial perturbations to disrupt the model's decision-making process. Factorization techniques reduce computational complexity while maintaining representational power, creating a more distributed representation that is less susceptible to targeted perturbations. Bottleneck designs compress information through smaller layers, forcing the model to learn more robust features that are less sensitive to noise. Squeeze-and-excitation modules improve channel-wise feature recalibration, allowing the model to focus on more robust feature combinations that are less affected by adversarial noise.

## Foundational Learning
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Deep learning architectures designed for image processing that use convolutional layers to extract spatial features
- Why needed: Understanding CNN architecture is fundamental to analyzing how architectural modifications affect robustness
- Quick check: Can you explain how convolutional layers differ from fully connected layers in feature extraction?

**Adversarial Attacks**: Methods that generate input perturbations to fool machine learning models
- Why needed: The study's core focus is on evaluating model robustness against these attacks
- Quick check: What distinguishes white-box attacks from black-box attacks in terms of attacker knowledge?

**Batch Normalization**: A technique that normalizes layer inputs to stabilize and accelerate training
- Why needed: The study identifies batch normalization as having a negative impact on robustness
- Quick check: How does batch normalization change during inference versus training?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pre-trained Models -> Adversarial Attack Generation -> Robustness Evaluation -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Loading -> Attack Implementation -> Metric Calculation -> Result Analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study highlights the tradeoff between performance (accuracy) and robustness (resistance to attacks), showing that techniques like batch normalization that improve accuracy can sometimes reduce robustness

**Failure Signatures**: Models with batch normalization layers show higher attack success rates; simpler architectures without architectural improvements demonstrate lower robustness to adversarial attacks

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement and verify FGSM attack on a simple CNN to establish baseline attack methodology
2. Add batch normalization to a VGG model and compare robustness before and after
3. Implement a residual connection in a basic architecture and test its impact on adversarial robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: How does the integration of batch normalization impact the robustness of different types of deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) beyond VGG?
- Basis in paper: The study focused on VGG models and observed that batch normalization negatively impacts their robustness to adversarial attacks
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore the effects of batch normalization on other types of deep learning models
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on a diverse set of deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) to assess the impact of batch normalization on their robustness to adversarial attacks

**Open Question 2**: What are the specific mechanisms by which squeeze-and-excitation modules and hard-swish activation functions improve the robustness of MobileNet V3?
- Basis in paper: The study observed that MobileNet V3, which incorporates squeeze-and-excitation modules and hard-swish activation functions, demonstrated superior robustness compared to its predecessor, MobileNet V2
- Why unresolved: The study did not investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the improved robustness of MobileNet V3
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting ablation studies to isolate the contributions of squeeze-and-excitation modules and hard-swish activation functions to the robustness of MobileNet V3

**Open Question 3**: How does the number of layers in a deep learning model affect its robustness to adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: The study observed that increasing the number of layers in VGG models led to improved robustness to adversarial attacks
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore the relationship between the number of layers and robustness in a broader context or across different types of models
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on a wide range of deep learning models with varying numbers of layers to establish a general trend or pattern in the relationship between model depth and robustness

## Limitations
- The study relies on pre-trained models without detailing their training procedures, making it difficult to isolate whether robustness differences stem from architectural design or training variations
- The evaluation uses only ImageNet with 1000 images, limiting generalizability to other datasets or larger-scale testing
- The paper does not report statistical significance testing or confidence intervals for the reported metrics

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core finding that architectural improvements (residual connections, factorization, bottleneck designs, squeeze-and-excitation) generally improve robustness while batch normalization can have negative effects
- **Medium confidence**: Specific robustness rankings between MobileNet V3, V2, and other architectures due to potential training procedure variations
- **Low confidence**: Precise numerical values for attack success rates, times, and noise rates without access to exact hyperparameters and seeds

## Next Checks
1. Re-run experiments with documented epsilon values and random seeds to verify reproducibility of key metrics
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing architectures with identical training procedures to isolate architectural effects from training variations
3. Test robustness across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) to assess generalizability beyond ImageNet
