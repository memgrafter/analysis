# Exploring the Nexus Between Retrievability and Query Generation Strategies

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.09473
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09473
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Different query generation techniques yield significantly different retrievability scores, with rule-based simulation showing the highest correlation to real queries.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses reproducibility challenges in retrievability assessments by comparing artificially generated queries to real query logs across multiple datasets. The authors demonstrate that different query generation techniques produce significantly different retrievability score distributions, with real queries showing the highest disparity and rule-based simulated queries the least. They find that the rule-based simulation technique (RSQ) achieves the highest correlation with real-query retrievability scores, suggesting it as a promising alternative when query logs are unavailable. The work highlights the need for standardized query set construction in retrievability studies and contributes to understanding accessibility nuances in information retrieval systems.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate retrievability across three datasets (TREC Robust, WT10g, Wikipedia) using five different query sets: four simulated (SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, RSQ) and one real (AOL). Documents are indexed with Apache Lucene and retrieval is performed using BM25 with tuned parameters. Retrievability scores are computed by counting how many queries retrieve each document within a cutoff rank, and inequality is quantified using the Gini coefficient. The study compares these scores across query sets using Pearson's r and Kendall's τ correlations to assess reproducibility and bias in accessibility measurements.

## Key Results
- Different query generation techniques yield significantly different retrievability score distributions
- Real queries show the highest disparity in retrievability scores compared to simulated queries
- Rule-based simulation (RSQ) achieves the highest correlation with real-query retrievability scores
- Real queries contain notably more named entities compared to simulated queries
- Rule-based simulation results in the least inequality (lowest Gini coefficients) across all datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Different query generation techniques lead to different retrievability score distributions because the query set determines which documents are retrieved at the cutoff rank.
- Mechanism: Retrievability scores are computed by counting how many queries retrieve each document within a cutoff rank. Simulated queries sample the term space differently from real queries, so the set of retrieved documents varies.
- Core assumption: The choice of query set directly influences the number of times each document appears within the cutoff.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "different query generation techniques yield significantly different retrievability scores"
  - [section]: "retrieval is performed with the set of queries, and the retrievability of a document d is computed in the third step as the summation of the number of times d is retrieved within the top c position"
  - [corpus]: Weak. Corpus shows related work on synthetic query generation but does not directly confirm the mechanism.
- Break condition: If the cutoff rank is increased to include all documents, the query set effect diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Simulated queries often lack the named entity richness of real queries, leading to systematically different retrievability distributions.
- Mechanism: Real queries contain more named entities, which tend to be more discriminative. Simulated queries from frequent terms miss these discriminative terms, reducing their ability to retrieve certain documents.
- Core assumption: Named entities in real queries are underrepresented in simulated queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "real queries contain a notably greater proportion of named entities compared to simulated queries"
  - [section]: "realistic queries generated using the rule-based approach (RSQ) result in even lower Gini coefficients across all datasets"
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct evidence in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If query simulation includes named entities, the disparity would reduce.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Rule-based simulation that filters N-grams by part-of-speech patterns produces query sets more similar to real queries, resulting in higher correlation with real-query retrievability scores.
- Mechanism: By retaining only N-grams with "query-like" POS tag patterns (noun-adj-noun, etc.), the rule-based method mimics the grammatical structure of real queries, increasing overlap in retrievability scores.
- Core assumption: POS-based filtering yields more discriminative and realistic query patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "alternative approach holds promise for improving reproducibility when query logs are unavailable"
  - [section]: "rule-based simulation technique (RSQ) results in the least inequality in the retrievability scores among all"
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct evidence in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: If the POS tagger or pattern rules are inaccurate, the similarity to real queries may decrease.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Part-of-speech tagging and N-gram extraction
  - Why needed here: The rule-based query generation relies on POS tagging to filter for "query-like" patterns, which improves realism.
  - Quick check question: What POS patterns does Justeson and Katz recommend for identifying collocations?

- Concept: Retrievability as a document accessibility metric
  - Why needed here: Understanding how retrievability scores are computed (via cutoff rank counts) is key to grasping why query set choice matters.
  - Quick check question: How is the retrievability score for a document computed mathematically?

- Concept: Gini coefficient and inequality metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper uses the Gini coefficient to quantify bias in retrievability distributions; understanding it helps interpret results.
  - Quick check question: What does a Gini coefficient of 0.6 indicate about a document collection's retrievability distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query generation module -> Retrieval engine (BM25) -> Retrievability score calculator -> Inequality summarizer (Gini)
- Critical path:
  1. Generate query sets (real logs or simulated)
  2. Index documents with Apache Lucene
  3. Retrieve documents for each query with BM25
  4. Count top-c retrievals per document
  5. Compute Gini coefficient
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Real queries: more realistic but harder to obtain and may have vocabulary mismatch.
  - Simulated queries: easier to generate but may misrepresent actual user behavior.
  - Rule-based simulation: adds complexity but improves realism and reproducibility.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between query sets -> query generation not representative.
  - Gini coefficient inconsistent across query sets -> systemic bias in retrieval.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Gini coefficients for all query sets on a small test collection.
  2. Measure Pearson and Kendall correlations between query sets' retrievability scores.
  3. Vary cutoff rank c and observe changes in retrievability score distributions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different retrieval models (beyond BM25) impact retrievability scores when using various query generation techniques?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses only BM25 as the retrieval model and mentions this as part of future work in the conclusion.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on a single retrieval model to isolate the effect of query generation techniques on retrievability scores.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of retrievability scores using multiple retrieval models (e.g., language models, neural rankers) with different query generation techniques across various collections.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal threshold for truncating N-grams in the rule-based query generation technique to maximize correlation with real query logs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The rule-based technique (RSQ) truncates N-grams based on frequency distribution inspired by AOL query logs, but specific optimal thresholds are not provided.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the technique but doesn't perform an in-depth analysis of threshold sensitivity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation varying truncation thresholds and measuring correlation with real query logs across multiple collections.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the temporal mismatch between query logs and document collections affect the validity of retrievability assessments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge temporal scope differences between datasets and query sets, particularly when using the AOL query log from 2006 with more recent collections.
- Why unresolved: The paper addresses this issue through exclusionary filtering but doesn't quantify the impact of temporal mismatch.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing retrievability scores using temporally matched versus mismatched query logs across collections with known temporal characteristics.

## Limitations

- The study's findings are limited by its reliance on a small set of datasets and query sets, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world retrieval scenarios.
- The rule-based simulation technique (RSQ) is only described in Appendix A, making it difficult to fully assess its implementation and potential biases.
- The paper does not address the impact of query set size on retrievability scores, which could be significant for smaller datasets.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The observation that different query generation techniques yield significantly different retrievability scores is well-supported by the data and methodology. The correlation between rule-based simulated queries and real queries is also robust.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that rule-based simulation is a promising alternative when query logs are unavailable is plausible but would benefit from further validation on additional datasets and query sets.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that real queries show the highest disparity in retrievability scores is less certain, as the study does not explore the full range of potential query sets or retrieval scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study on additional datasets (e.g., ClueWeb, GOV2) to assess the generalizability of the findings across different domains and collection sizes.
2. Compare the performance of RSQ with other query generation techniques (e.g., neural query generation) to determine if it remains the most effective method for improving reproducibility.
3. Investigate the impact of query set size on retrievability scores by systematically varying the number of queries in each set and observing changes in the Gini coefficient and correlation metrics.
