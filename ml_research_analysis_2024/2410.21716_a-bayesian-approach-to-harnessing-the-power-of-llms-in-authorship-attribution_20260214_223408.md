# A Bayesian Approach to Harnessing the Power of LLMs in Authorship Attribution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21716
- Reference count: 12
- This study achieves 85% accuracy on one-shot authorship attribution using pre-trained LLMs without fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to authorship attribution that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) through a Bayesian framework. The method uses probability outputs from LLMs to infer authorship by calculating the likelihood that an unknown text was written by a specific author, achieving 85% accuracy on IMDb and blog datasets. The approach requires only a single forward pass per author and demonstrates high efficiency compared to traditional fine-tuning methods. By utilizing prompt construction and log probability aggregation, the method provides a new baseline for one-shot authorship analysis without requiring manual feature engineering.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs a Bayesian framework that utilizes pre-trained LLMs (specifically Llama-3-70B) to perform one-shot authorship attribution. For each candidate author, the method creates a prompt using their known texts, then calculates the token-level log probabilities from the LLM for the unknown text given this prompt. These log probabilities are aggregated into a text-level score representing the likelihood that the unknown text was written by that author. The method then applies Bayesian inference to calculate posterior probabilities of authorship across all candidates, returning the author with the highest probability as the attribution result. The approach requires no fine-tuning of the LLM and uses only a single forward pass per author, making it computationally efficient.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85% accuracy on IMDb and blog datasets for one-shot authorship attribution across ten authors
- Sets new baselines for one-shot authorship analysis without requiring fine-tuning or manual feature engineering
- Demonstrates high efficiency with only a single forward pass per author required

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Log probability from LLMs can serve as a reliable measure of authorship likelihood without fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: The method computes token-level log probabilities from an LLM, aggregates them into a text-level log probability, and uses these scores to infer which author is most likely to have written an unknown text.
- Core assumption: The probability distribution of text generated by an author is unique enough that the LLM can distinguish between authors based on log probability differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our methodology calculates the probability that a text entails previous writings of an author, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of authorship."
  - [section 2] "We propose a novel approach based on a Bayesian framework that utilizes the probability outputs from LLMs."
- Break condition: If the training data lacks diversity or the authors' writing styles are too similar, the LLM may not be able to reliably distinguish between authors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Bayesian framework allows for accurate one-shot authorship attribution.
- Mechanism: By treating the unknown text as a sample from the same distribution as the known texts from each author, the method calculates the posterior probability of authorship for each candidate.
- Core assumption: The "sufficient training set" assumption, where the known texts from an author are sufficient to represent their writing style.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "We then introduce the 'sufficient training set' assumption, where P(aj|t(ai)) = 1 if ai = aj and 0 otherwise."
  - [abstract] "By utilizing only pre-trained models such as Llama-3-70B, our results on the IMDb and blog datasets show an impressive 85% accuracy in one-shot authorship classification across ten authors."
- Break condition: If the unknown text is too short or the known texts are not representative of the author's typical style, the Bayesian inference may be inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt construction enhances the accuracy of log probability estimation.
- Mechanism: By providing the LLM with a prompt that includes an example text from the candidate author, the method guides the LLM to focus on the stylistic features of the author when calculating the log probability of the unknown text.
- Core assumption: The LLM's output is sensitive to the prompt, and a well-designed prompt can improve the accuracy of the log probability estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "To estimate P(u|t(ai)) for authorship attribution, we define P(u|t(ai)) = PLLM(u|prompt_construction(t(ai)))."
  - [section 4.3] "Using prompts is essential for enhancing the accuracy of our method (#1 vs. #2)."
- Break condition: If the prompt is poorly designed or does not provide sufficient context, the LLM may not focus on the relevant stylistic features, leading to inaccurate log probability estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian inference
  - Why needed here: The method relies on calculating posterior probabilities of authorship for each candidate author based on the likelihood of the unknown text given the known texts from each author.
  - Quick check question: What is the formula for calculating the posterior probability in Bayesian inference?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Why needed here: The method uses the probability outputs from pre-trained LLMs to estimate the likelihood of an unknown text given the known texts from each author.
  - Quick check question: How do LLMs calculate the probability of a token or sequence of tokens given prior context?

- Concept: Prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The method relies on constructing prompts that guide the LLM to focus on the stylistic features of the candidate authors when calculating the log probability of the unknown text.
  - Quick check question: What are some best practices for designing prompts that elicit the desired behavior from LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Prompt Construction -> LLM Probability Calculation -> Log Probability Aggregation -> Posterior Probability Calculation -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Construct prompts for each candidate author using their known texts and the unknown text.
  2. Compute the log probability of the unknown text given each prompt using the LLM.
  3. Calculate the posterior probability of authorship for each candidate author using the Bayesian formula.
  4. Return the author with the highest posterior probability as the most likely author of the unknown text.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a larger LLM may improve accuracy but increase computational cost.
  - Using more known texts from each author may improve accuracy but increase the size of the prompts and computational cost.
  - Using a more complex prompt construction may improve accuracy but increase the complexity of the implementation.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy: The LLM may not be able to distinguish between authors' writing styles, or the prompts may not be effectively guiding the LLM.
  - High computational cost: The LLM may be too large, or the prompts may be too long, leading to slow inference times.
  - Bias: The known texts may not be representative of the authors' typical writing styles, or the LLM may be biased towards certain writing styles.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the accuracy of the method on a small dataset with a known ground truth to verify that the method is working as intended.
  2. Vary the size of the LLM (e.g., Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-13B, Llama-2-70B) to see how it affects accuracy and computational cost.
  3. Vary the number of known texts used from each author (e.g., 1, 5, 10) to see how it affects accuracy and prompt size.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the accuracy of the LLM-based authorship attribution method scale with the number of candidate authors beyond 50?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests accuracy up to 50 candidates but notes that accuracy decreases as candidate count increases.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests up to 50 candidates, leaving open questions about performance at larger scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the method with hundreds or thousands of candidate authors and measuring accuracy trends.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of dataset diversity on the model's ability to generalize across different writing styles and topics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that biases in training data can affect performance, implying that dataset diversity is crucial.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how different levels of dataset diversity affect the model's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets of varying diversity and measuring the impact on authorship attribution accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the method perform on languages other than English, particularly those with different grammatical structures or scripts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on English datasets (IMDb and blog) and does not address multilingual performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test the method on non-English languages, leaving its applicability to other languages unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the method to multilingual datasets and comparing performance across languages.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the computational requirements for scaling this method to real-time authorship attribution in large-scale applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions efficiency in terms of inference time but does not discuss scalability to real-time applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the computational demands of scaling the method for real-time use in large-scale applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the method's performance in real-time scenarios with large datasets and analyzing computational requirements.

## Limitations

- The approach assumes that a single text from an author is sufficient to represent their writing style, which may break down for authors with inconsistent styles.
- Performance on domains outside of IMDb and blog datasets remains untested, raising questions about generalization to legal documents, academic papers, or technical writing.
- The method lacks cross-dataset validation, with no evidence of performance on out-of-distribution data or different writing styles.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The Bayesian framework itself and the log probability calculation method are well-established. The architectural components (prompt construction, LLM integration) are technically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The 85% accuracy claim is supported by results on two datasets but lacks cross-dataset validation. The claim that no fine-tuning is required should be qualified by noting that prompt engineering still requires some manual design.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that this approach sets "new baselines for one-shot authorship analysis" is difficult to verify without a comprehensive comparison to existing methods across multiple datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset evaluation**: Test the method on at least two additional datasets from different domains (e.g., academic papers, news articles, technical documentation) to assess generalization performance and identify potential domain-specific limitations.

2. **Author similarity stress test**: Create synthetic datasets with authors having deliberately similar writing styles (similar vocabulary, sentence structure, and topic preferences) to determine the method's failure points and accuracy degradation patterns.

3. **Known-text quantity sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the number of known texts used per author (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 10) to quantify how the accuracy scales with more training data and identify the minimum effective sample size for reliable attribution.
