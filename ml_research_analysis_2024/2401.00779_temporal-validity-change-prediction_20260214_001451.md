# Temporal Validity Change Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.00779
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00779
- Reference count: 28
- Models achieve up to 78.7% accuracy on temporal validity change prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Temporal Validity Change Prediction (TVCP), a novel NLP task that predicts how context affects the temporal validity duration of statements. The authors create a dataset from Twitter statements and crowdsourced follow-up contexts, then benchmark transformer models including BERT, RoBERTa, and ChatGPT. They find that a Siamese RoBERTa architecture achieves 78.7% accuracy and 48.2% exact match, while multitask learning improves performance across models. ChatGPT underperforms fine-tuned models, and model performance increases with more training data but plateaus around 75% of the dataset.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a Siamese transformer architecture that processes target and follow-up statements separately, combining their embeddings through element-wise operations to capture temporal validity changes. They implement multitask learning by jointly predicting TVCP class and temporal validity duration, using BERT-Base-uncased and RoBERTa-Base embeddings with specific dropout rates and learning rates. The models are trained using ADAMW optimizer with cross-entropy loss, evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation, and tested on accuracy and Exact Match metrics across Twitter-sourced temporal statements.

## Key Results
- Siamese RoBERTa architecture achieves 78.7% accuracy and 48.2% exact match on TVCP task
- Multitask learning improves accuracy by 2.3 percentage points and EM by 2.4 percentage points across models
- ChatGPT achieves 71.4% accuracy, underperforming fine-tuned transformer models
- Model performance plateaus around 75% of the dataset during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Siamese architecture improves performance by learning comparative representations between target and follow-up statements
- Mechanism: Instead of processing concatenated statements, the Siamese network creates separate embeddings for st and sf, then combines them through element-wise operations ([hst, hsf, hst - hsf, hst ⊗ hsf]). This allows the model to explicitly capture the relationship between statements rather than treating them as a single sequence
- Core assumption: Temporal validity changes depend on the relationship between statements, not just their combined content
- Evidence anchors:
  - "SIAMESE CLASSIFIER : Builds a hidden representation from the concatenated embeddings [hst, hsf , hst − hsf , hst ⊗ hsf ], where hst and hsf are the sentence-embedding tokens of the target- and follow-up statement, respectively"
  - "it improves much more when switching to the SIAMESE CLASSIFIER implementation"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multitask learning with temporal validity duration prediction improves embeddings for TVCP classification
- Mechanism: The auxiliary task of predicting TV d(st) and TV sf d (st) provides additional gradient signals that help the model learn better temporal representations, which transfer to improved TVCP classification
- Core assumption: Understanding temporal validity duration is a prerequisite for understanding how context changes that duration
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Our intuition is that embeddings with an understanding of TV d may be better suited for TVCP"
  - "we find p = 0.0027 for accuracy, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.0036, 0.0192]. For EM, p = 0.0025, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.0089, 0.0487]"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Freezing ROBERTA embedding layers prevents the model from getting stuck in poor local minima during fine-tuning
- Mechanism: By keeping pre-trained embeddings fixed, the model focuses on learning task-specific transformations in higher layers rather than disrupting the valuable pre-trained representations
- Core assumption: ROBERTA's pre-trained embeddings contain useful temporal and semantic information that shouldn't be altered during TVCP fine-tuning
- Evidence anchors:
  - "For some ROBERTA-based models, we freeze embedding layers (i.e., only fine-tune intermediate and classification weights), as training all parameters leads to poor performance"
  - "ROBERTA gets stuck in a false minimum of predicting a constant class when embedding layers are unfrozen"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal validity as a binary property of text at specific timestamps
  - Why needed here: The entire task depends on understanding when text remains valid, which requires grasping the concept of time-dependent truth values
  - Quick check question: Given the statement "I'm at the park", would you expect it to be valid 2 hours after it was written? Why or why not?

- Concept: Difference between explicit and implicit temporal validity changes
  - Why needed here: The dataset contains both types of changes, and models need to distinguish between direct temporal modifications and those requiring inference
  - Quick check question: Is "The meeting is postponed to 3pm" an explicit or implicit change to temporal validity compared to "The meeting is in the conference room"?

- Concept: Siamese network architecture for comparative learning
  - Why needed here: The best-performing model uses this architecture, and understanding its mechanics is crucial for debugging and improvement
  - Quick check question: How does a Siamese network's approach to comparing two inputs differ from simply concatenating them and processing as one sequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input statements → BERT/ROBERTA embeddings → Siamese comparison layer → Classification head (+ optional regression heads for multitask) → Output class
- Critical path: The comparison operations in the Siamese layer (difference and element-wise multiplication) are critical as they capture the relationship between statements that determines temporal validity change
- Design tradeoffs: Siamese architecture provides explicit relationship modeling but requires more parameters than simple concatenation; multitask learning provides better embeddings but adds complexity and training time
- Failure signatures: Constant prediction of a single class suggests embedding issues; poor performance on specific change types (DEC vs INC) indicates relationship modeling problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Siamese vs concatenated input performance on a small validation set
  2. Test multitask vs single-task performance with identical hyperparameters
  3. Evaluate impact of freezing vs unfreezing embedding layers on ROBERTA-based models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does multitask learning with temporal validity duration prediction as an auxiliary task improve performance across different text sources beyond Twitter?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates multitask learning on a Twitter-based dataset and finds it improves model performance, but notes that current weights may be task-specific and not generalize well to other text sources.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted solely on Twitter data, and the paper acknowledges limitations in external validity regarding different text sources.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating multitask learning performance on datasets from other sources (news, Wikipedia, social media platforms) would show whether the improvement generalizes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can temporal validity change prediction be effectively implemented as a generative task rather than classification?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions future work could explore using the dataset for generative approaches, including generative adversarial networks.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is purely classification-based, and the paper suggests this direction but doesn't explore it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating generative models (e.g., GPT-style models) that predict temporal validity changes through text generation would provide evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of temporal validity change prediction models scale with dataset size beyond the current dataset?
- Basis in paper: The paper finds that model performance increases with more training data but plateaus around 75% of the current dataset, suggesting potential for improvement with more data.
- Why unresolved: The current dataset size limits conclusions about scaling behavior, and the paper suggests collecting more data but doesn't implement this.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training models on progressively larger datasets (including automatically extracted samples) would show the true scaling relationship and potential performance ceiling.

## Limitations

- The Siamese architecture shows only modest performance improvement (78.7% vs 77.8%) over baseline BERT, suggesting limited generalizability
- Multitask learning improvements (2.3-2.4 percentage points) are statistically significant but have small effect sizes
- Dataset is limited to Twitter data, restricting external validity to other text sources and domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** ChatGPT's underperformance (71.4% accuracy) relative to fine-tuned models is well-supported by direct comparisons with consistent evaluation protocols. Freezing ROBERTA embedding layers preventing poor local minima is strongly evidenced by dramatic performance drops when embeddings are unfrozen.

**Medium Confidence:** Siamese architecture improvement through explicit relationship modeling is supported by comparative results but lacks ablation studies isolating specific pairwise operation contributions. Multitask learning improvement is statistically significant but the causal mechanism remains speculative.

**Low Confidence:** The 75% dataset size plateau assertion is based on aggregate training curves without individual model-specific analysis, potentially being an artifact of this particular dataset.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study of Siamese components:** Systematically remove each pairwise operation ([hst - hsf] and [hst ⊗ hsf]) individually and jointly to isolate which specific comparison mechanisms drive the performance improvement.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test:** Evaluate the best-performing Siamese RoBERTa model on temporally annotated statements from different domains (news articles, scientific papers, social media) to assess whether the architecture generalizes beyond Twitter-based temporal validity changes.

3. **Representation analysis for multitask learning:** Use probing classifiers to examine whether the multitask objective specifically improves temporal representation quality by testing if intermediate layer activations show enhanced ability to predict temporal attributes (time expressions, duration spans) compared to single-task trained models.
