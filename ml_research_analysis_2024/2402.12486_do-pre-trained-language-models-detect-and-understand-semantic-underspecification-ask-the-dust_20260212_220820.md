# Do Pre-Trained Language Models Detect and Understand Semantic Underspecification? Ask the DUST!

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12486
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12486
- Authors: Frank Wildenburg; Michael Hanna; Sandro Pezzelle
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Pre-trained language models can moderately identify underspecification when explicitly prompted, but struggle to correctly interpret underspecified sentences in naturalistic settings, revealing limitations in current LM semantic processing.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DUST, a dataset of semantically underspecified sentences and more specified counterparts grouped by type of underspecification. The authors evaluate whether pre-trained language models can detect and correctly interpret underspecified language using two experiments: 1) prompting models to distinguish underspecified from more specified sentences, and 2) testing model interpretations of underspecified vs. specified sentences without explicit prompts. Results show that newer models (Llama 2, Mistral) can moderately identify underspecification when explicitly prompted, but all models struggle to correctly interpret underspecified sentences in naturalistic settings. This reveals limitations in current LMs' processing of sentence semantics and highlights the importance of using naturalistic data and communicative scenarios when evaluating LMs' language capabilities.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces DUST, a Dataset of semantically Underspecified Sentences grouped by Type, containing 2,123 English underspecified sentences and equally many specified counterparts. Two main experiments are conducted: Experiment 1 tests if LMs can distinguish underspecified sentences from more specified counterparts when explicitly prompted with comparative specification labels; Experiment 2 tests if LMs correctly interpret underspecified vs. specified sentences in a more naturalistic communicative setting using perplexity-based approaches. The study uses models including GPT-2 XL, FLAN-T5 XXL, OPT-13b, Llama 2 7b and 13b, and Mistral 7b v0.1, evaluating their performance on detecting and interpreting semantic underspecification.

## Key Results
- Newer LMs (Llama 2, Mistral) can moderately identify underspecified sentences when explicitly prompted with comparative specification labels
- All models struggle to correctly interpret underspecified sentences in naturalistic settings, showing little uncertainty in their interpretations
- Concrete lexical content correlates with better underspecification detection, with models performing better on sentences containing more concrete words

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Models can detect underspecification when explicitly prompted with comparative specification labels
- Mechanism: By constructing prompts that directly compare an underspecified sentence to its more specified counterpart, the model is given a clear contrastive task that leverages its learned representation of sentence-level detail and specificity
- Core assumption: The model has sufficient capacity to distinguish fine-grained semantic differences between sentence pairs when these differences are explicitly highlighted in the prompt
- Evidence anchors: "Newer LMs are reasonably able to identify underspecified sentences when explicitly prompted" and "All models besides Flan-T5 do so at a rate significantly higher than chance"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models default to a single interpretation of underspecified sentences unless explicitly guided to consider alternatives
- Mechanism: Without explicit prompts, models collapse underspecified sentences into one plausible interpretation, mirroring a heuristic processing strategy rather than exploring the full ambiguity space
- Core assumption: The model's generation and probability estimation processes favor coherence and fluency over exhaustive semantic exploration, leading to biased interpretations
- Evidence anchors: "interpreting them correctly is much harder for any LMs" and "when interpreting underspecified sentences, LMs exhibit little uncertainty"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Concrete lexical content in sentences correlates with better underspecification detection
- Mechanism: Sentences with higher concreteness ratings allow models to anchor interpretations in more tangible semantic referents, improving their ability to differentiate between levels of specification
- Core assumption: The model's embeddings capture concreteness as a feature that influences semantic differentiation, possibly because concrete words have more stable and consistent meanings across contexts
- Evidence anchors: "These results suggest that models are better able to recognize semantic underspecification when the words in the sentence are more concrete"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic underspecification vs. ambiguity
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing underspecification from ambiguity is essential to frame the evaluation and avoid conflating phenomena
  - Quick check question: Can a sentence be underspecified without being ambiguous? (Answer: Yes, if it has only one possible reading but lacks sufficient detail.)

- Concept: Perplexity-based evaluation
  - Why needed here: The experiments rely on comparing perplexity scores across sentence variants to infer model sensitivity to specification differences
  - Quick check question: What does lower perplexity for a specification-matched prompt indicate? (Answer: The model finds the label-sentence pairing more coherent.)

- Concept: Prompt sensitivity
  - Why needed here: Model performance is heavily influenced by prompt wording, which is central to interpreting experimental results
  - Quick check question: How does increasing prompt explicitness affect model accuracy? (Answer: It generally improves accuracy, as seen in the second experiment.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DUST dataset -> Experimental prompts (comparative specification) -> Model perplexity scoring -> Statistical analysis of correctness
- Critical path: Construct minimal sentence pairs -> Embed in contrastive prompts -> Compute perplexity differences -> Evaluate above/below chance performance
- Design tradeoffs: Minimal pairs ensure controlled evaluation but limit coverage of complex underspecification; explicit prompts improve detectability but may not reflect naturalistic use
- Failure signatures: Performance near chance level indicates inability to detect specification; lack of difference between underspecified and specified continuations signals failure to model ambiguity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify prompt design works with sentiment classification (control)
  2. Test underspecification detection with explicit prompts
  3. Evaluate interpretation of underspecified vs. specified sentences without explicit guidance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does underspecification in text impact language model performance differently based on concreteness of words used?
- Basis in paper: Paper shows models perform better at recognizing underspecification when sentences contain more concrete words, based on logistic regression analysis of surface-level statistics
- Why unresolved: While correlation is established, causal relationship and underlying mechanisms are not explored
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying concreteness while holding underspecification constant, or vice versa, would help isolate the effects

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the presence of underspecification in training data affect a language model's ability to handle it in inference?
- Basis in paper: The paper tests models on underspecified sentences but doesn't examine whether exposure to such patterns during training improves performance
- Why unresolved: The study uses pre-trained models without investigating the relationship between training data composition and underspecification handling capabilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of models trained with varying amounts of underspecified data would clarify this relationship

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do language models develop default interpretations for underspecified sentences similar to human cognitive biases?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that models show little uncertainty when interpreting underspecified sentences, contrary to theoretical accounts that predict ambiguity in interpretation
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes this tendency, it doesn't systematically investigate whether models develop consistent default interpretations across different types of underspecification
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing model outputs across many underspecified sentences to identify consistent interpretation patterns would reveal whether models mimic human processing patterns

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on manually crafted sentence pairs that may not represent natural underspecification diversity
- Prompt-based approach introduces artificial settings that may not reflect unconstrained LM processing
- Perplexity-based metrics may not fully capture semantic understanding or interpretation quality
- Study focuses on English language models, limiting multilingual generalizability

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Models can moderately identify underspecification when explicitly prompted with comparative specification labels
- Medium Confidence: Models default to single interpretations of underspecified sentences in naturalistic settings
- Low Confidence: Concrete lexical content correlates with better underspecification detection

## Next Checks
1. Test whether the same models show sensitivity to underspecification when evaluated on naturally occurring underspecified sentences from large-scale corpora
2. Modify the experimental setup to explicitly require models to generate multiple interpretations for underspecified sentences
3. Evaluate whether models trained on English data can detect and interpret underspecification in other languages using translated versions of DUST
