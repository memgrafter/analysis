# Recall Them All: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Long Object List Extraction from Long Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02732
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: L3X achieves up to 85% recall and 50% R@P50 on long object list extraction tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces L3X, a novel method for extracting long lists of objects from lengthy documents. The approach addresses the limitations of existing information extraction methods when dealing with extensive lists by employing a two-stage architecture that combines recall-oriented generation with precision-oriented validation. L3X leverages retrieval-augmented language models to enhance both recall and precision, demonstrating significant improvements over LLM-only baselines across two diverse datasets.

## Method Summary
L3X tackles long object list extraction through a two-stage process. First, it uses an LLM with retrieval augmentation to generate candidate objects, employing techniques like passage ranking and evidence retrieval to improve recall. Second, it applies precision-oriented classifiers (score-based thresholding, confidence elicitation, and predicate-specific classifiers) to validate or prune candidates. The method is evaluated on fiction books and web documents, showing substantial performance gains over baselines, particularly with the pseudo-relevance feedback variant.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 85% recall on long object list extraction tasks
- R@P50 reaches almost 50%, representing substantial improvement over baselines
- Best configuration (amp/pred) combines pseudo-relevance feedback with predicate-specific classifiers
- Performance degrades for extremely long lists and loosely defined extraction cues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The L3X approach works by addressing the fundamental challenge of balancing recall and precision in long object list extraction. The retrieval-augmented generation stage helps capture more candidates by providing relevant context to the LLM, while the subsequent validation stage filters out incorrect candidates using specialized classifiers. The two-stage architecture allows for separate optimization of recall and precision, which is particularly effective for the inherent difficulty of extracting long, complex lists from lengthy documents.

## Foundational Learning

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- **Why needed**: Standard LLMs struggle with long lists due to context limitations and lack of focused attention on relevant passages
- **Quick check**: Verify that retrieval modules provide relevant passages by examining top-k retrieved results

### Two-Stage Architecture
- **Why needed**: Separating recall generation from precision validation allows for independent optimization of each objective
- **Quick check**: Confirm that recall improves in stage one and precision improves in stage two

### Predicate-Specific Classifiers
- **Why needed**: Different types of lists require different validation criteria based on their semantic properties
- **Quick check**: Test classifier performance on held-out examples for each predicate type

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
LLM with retrieval augmentation -> Candidate Generation -> Precision Classifiers -> Final Output

### Critical Path
Document input → Passage ranking → Retrieval augmentation → LLM generation → Candidate validation → Final list

### Design Tradeoffs
The method trades increased computational cost (due to retrieval and multiple processing stages) for improved recall and precision. The use of predicate-specific classifiers improves accuracy but requires more training data and domain knowledge.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor recall when extraction cues are sparse or ambiguous
- High computational overhead from retrieval operations
- Degraded performance on extremely long lists (>100 items)
- Reduced effectiveness when predicates are not well-defined

### First Experiments
1. Compare recall of retrieval-augmented LLM vs. standard LLM on a subset of documents
2. Evaluate precision gains from each classifier type independently
3. Test performance degradation on artificially extended lists

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance significantly degrades for extremely long lists and loosely defined extraction cues
- Computational costs associated with retrieval augmentation may limit practical deployment
- Absolute precision levels remain moderate (R@P50 reaching only 50%)
- Reliance on pre-defined predicates may limit flexibility for open-domain extraction

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Method's ability to improve recall over baselines
- **Medium confidence**: General effectiveness of two-stage architecture
- **Low confidence**: Method's robustness for extremely challenging extraction scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance on documents with varying ambiguity levels and extraction cue densities
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of each retrieval augmentation technique
3. Measure computational overhead and inference time compared to baseline approaches
