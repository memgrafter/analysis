# Advancing Retail Data Science: Comprehensive Evaluation of Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13130
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces comprehensive evaluation framework for synthetic retail data across fidelity, utility, and privacy dimensions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of evaluating synthetic retail data by introducing a tripartite framework that systematically assesses generative AI models across three essential dimensions: fidelity (statistical similarity to real data), utility (performance in downstream tasks), and privacy (protection against re-identification). The framework employs holdout-based evaluation to prevent overfitting and uses domain-agnostic, non-parametric metrics to ensure broad applicability across different retail contexts. Through comprehensive testing on the Complete Journey dataset, the framework demonstrates that TabAutoDiff and CTGAN models outperform alternatives in balancing the three evaluation criteria.

## Method Summary
The evaluation framework operates by first preprocessing retail transaction data and splitting it into training, holdout, and evaluation sets. Five generative models (CTGAN, AutoGAN, TabDDPM, StasyAutoDiff, and TabAutoDiff) are trained exclusively on the training set, generating synthetic datasets of equal size. The framework then applies a battery of non-parametric metrics to assess fidelity (Wasserstein and Jensen-Shannon distances for continuous attributes, correlation matrices for discrete attributes), utility (classification accuracy and product association analysis), and privacy (Distance to Closest Record and Closest Cluster Ratio). The holdout dataset serves as an independent benchmark to evaluate generalization capabilities.

## Key Results
- TabAutoDiff and CTGAN models demonstrate superior performance across fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics
- Synthetic data achieves comparable utility to real data in classification tasks while maintaining privacy guarantees
- The framework successfully identifies trade-offs between model performance and privacy protection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The tripartite evaluation framework (fidelity, utility, privacy) works because it directly maps to the three dimensions where synthetic data must demonstrate value in retail.
- Mechanism: By structuring evaluation around these three pillars, the framework ensures that synthetic data is assessed both on its statistical similarity to real data (fidelity), its performance in downstream tasks (utility), and its privacy guarantees (privacy). This comprehensive coverage prevents the common pitfall of optimizing for one metric at the expense of others.
- Core assumption: Fidelity, utility, and privacy are the three critical dimensions for retail synthetic data to be useful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "focusing on fidelity, utility, and privacy"
  - [section] "Our framework distinguishes between continuous and discrete attributes within retail datasets, providing clear methodologies for their evaluation."
- Break condition: If the evaluation framework is applied to a domain where these three pillars are not equally important (e.g., synthetic data for gaming), the framework may not be optimal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The holdout-based evaluation approach effectively prevents overfitting and ensures generalizability.
- Mechanism: By training the generative model only on the training dataset T and evaluating on a held-out dataset H, the framework prevents the model from simply memorizing the training data. The comparison between metrics on H and the synthetic dataset S reveals whether the model has learned generalizable patterns.
- Core assumption: A good generative model should perform similarly on both the training and held-out data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "By exposing only the training dataset T to the synthesizer, we generate a synthetic dataset S of the same size as T. The isolated holdout dataset H can then serve as a benchmark to assess the synthesizer's ability to generalize beyond the data it was trained on."
  - [corpus] "Holdout-based empirical assessment of mixed-type synthetic data"
- Break condition: If the holdout dataset is not representative of the training data distribution, the evaluation results may be misleading.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The use of domain-agnostic, non-parametric metrics ensures the framework is broadly applicable.
- Mechanism: By relying on statistical measures like Wasserstein distance, Jensen-Shannon distance, and correlation matrices, the framework avoids making assumptions about the underlying data distribution. This allows it to be applied to various retail datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge.
- Core assumption: Non-parametric metrics are sufficient to capture the essential characteristics of retail data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Utilizing non-parametric measures, our data-centric evaluation provides a systematic review of an array of black-box synthetic data solutions, examining whether generated data is practical, safe, and broadly applicable."
  - [corpus] "Holdout-based empirical assessment of mixed-type synthetic data"
- Break condition: If the retail dataset has very specific, non-statistical characteristics that are critical for downstream tasks, non-parametric metrics may miss these nuances.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Wasserstein distance
  - Why needed here: To measure the similarity of numerical feature distributions between real and synthetic data.
  - Quick check question: What does a small Wasserstein distance indicate about the similarity between two distributions?

- Concept: Differential Privacy
  - Why needed here: To ensure the synthetic data does not compromise individual privacy by being too similar to specific records in the training data.
  - Quick check question: How does Differential Privacy protect against the risk of re-identification in synthetic data?

- Concept: Market basket analysis
  - Why needed here: To evaluate the utility of synthetic data in capturing product associations and co-purchase patterns, which are crucial for retail applications like recommendation systems.
  - Quick check question: What metric is commonly used in market basket analysis to measure the strength of association between two products?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Train/holdout/eval split -> Generative model training -> Synthetic data generation -> Fidelity evaluation -> Utility evaluation -> Privacy evaluation
- Critical path: preprocess data -> split data -> train generative model on training set -> generate synthetic data -> evaluate synthetic data using fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics -> compare results to real data
- Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes comprehensive evaluation over speed, using multiple metrics and datasets. It also prioritizes privacy, using differential privacy techniques even if they may slightly reduce utility.
- Failure signatures: If the synthetic data fails to capture the joint distributions of features, it will have low fidelity scores. If it fails to generalize to unseen data, the utility scores on the holdout set will be significantly lower than on the training set. If it's too similar to the training data, it will have high privacy risk scores.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the framework on a small, simple retail dataset to verify the pipeline works end-to-end.
  2. Compare the performance of two different generative models (e.g., CTGAN and TabAutoDiff) on the same dataset to see which performs better.
  3. Evaluate the impact of different data preprocessing techniques (e.g., feature scaling, encoding) on the fidelity and utility scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between fidelity and privacy metrics in synthetic retail data generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that fidelity and privacy are both crucial aspects of synthetic data evaluation, but does not provide a specific balance point.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates these metrics separately but does not provide a framework for combining them into a single optimal score.
- What evidence would resolve it: A weighted scoring system that combines fidelity and privacy metrics, validated across multiple retail datasets and use cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different generative models perform on higher-order dependencies and dynamic patterns in retail data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that existing models struggle with product association analysis and capturing complex pairwise relationships.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on basic statistical properties and simple tasks, leaving higher-order interactions unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive testing of generative models on tasks requiring understanding of complex, multi-step customer decision processes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of synthetic data quality on downstream machine learning tasks beyond classification and product association?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates utility through classification tasks and product association analysis, but acknowledges this is limited.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of synthetic data quality on more complex machine learning tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, or reinforcement learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing of synthetic data across a wide range of machine learning tasks, measuring performance degradation or improvement compared to real data.

## Limitations

- The framework's generalizability to other retail contexts may be constrained by the specific characteristics of the Complete Journey dataset used for validation
- The privacy evaluation, while thorough, relies on specific metrics that may not capture all privacy risks, particularly for datasets with complex relationships or rare events
- The framework prioritizes comprehensive evaluation over computational efficiency, potentially limiting its practicality for real-time applications

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in methodological rigor for assessing synthetic retail data across fidelity, utility, and privacy dimensions
- **Medium confidence** in framework's generalizability to different retail contexts and ability to detect all privacy breaches
- **Medium confidence** in scalability to larger datasets and more complex downstream tasks

## Next Checks

1. Apply the framework to a distinct retail dataset with different characteristics (e.g., grocery vs. fashion retail) to validate cross-domain applicability of the fidelity and utility findings.

2. Test the framework's sensitivity to privacy breaches by deliberately introducing known privacy vulnerabilities in synthetic data and measuring detection rates using the proposed metrics.

3. Evaluate the framework's performance when applied to smaller datasets (under 100K transactions) to assess scalability and whether the current hyperparameter settings remain optimal for different data volumes.
