# FairTP: A Prolonged Fairness Framework for Traffic Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16214
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Achieves prolonged fairness in traffic prediction by improving region-based static fairness (RSF) by 15.89% to 128.69% and sensor-based dynamic fairness (SDF) by 1.299 to 6.533 while maintaining or enhancing accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical issue of fairness in traffic prediction for intelligent transportation systems, where existing approaches focus on overall accuracy but overlook fairness, especially when traffic sensors are unevenly distributed. The authors introduce FairTP, a framework designed to achieve prolonged fairness by defining two novel metrics: region-based static fairness (RSF) and sensor-based dynamic fairness (SDF). FairTP uses a state identification module to classify sensor states as "sacrifice" or "benefit" based on prediction accuracy and employs a state-guided balanced sampling strategy to improve performance in underprivileged areas. Experiments on two real-world datasets (HK and SD) show that FairTP significantly improves prediction fairness while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy, with MAE improvements ranging from 4.86% to 50.28%.

## Method Summary
FairTP is a framework that achieves prolonged fairness in traffic prediction by dynamically adjusting sensor sampling probabilities based on their prediction accuracy states. The method uses a state identification module to classify sensors as "sacrifice" (low accuracy) or "benefit" (high accuracy) states, then employs a state-guided balanced sampling strategy to improve performance in underprivileged areas. The framework defines two complementary fairness metrics—region-based static fairness (RSF) and sensor-based dynamic fairness (SDF)—to address both immediate and long-term fairness concerns. FairTP integrates fairness objectives directly into the training loss, allowing it to maintain high predictive accuracy while improving fairness through joint optimization of accuracy and fairness losses.

## Key Results
- FairTP improves region-based static fairness (RSF) by 15.89% to 128.69% across datasets
- Sensor-based dynamic fairness (SDF) improves by 1.299 to 6.533 compared to baseline models
- Maintains or enhances accuracy with MAE improvements ranging from 4.86% to 50.28%
- Effectively balances performance across regions and achieves both short-term static and prolonged dynamic fairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FairTP achieves prolonged fairness by dynamically adjusting sensor sampling probabilities based on their prediction accuracy states.
- Mechanism: The framework alternates sensor states between "sacrifice" (low accuracy) and "benefit" (high accuracy). Sensors identified as "sacrifice" are sampled more frequently to improve their performance, balancing overall accuracy across regions.
- Core assumption: Sensor accuracy states can be reliably identified and used to guide sampling without degrading the model's overall predictive capability.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section]
- Break condition: If the state identification module cannot accurately distinguish between "sacrifice" and "benefit" states, or if the sampling adjustment causes significant accuracy loss in privileged regions, prolonged fairness cannot be achieved.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework defines two complementary fairness metrics—region-based static fairness (RSF) and sensor-based dynamic fairness (SDF)—to address both immediate and long-term fairness concerns.
- Mechanism: RSF measures prediction disparities between regions at each time point, while SDF evaluates the overall state consistency of sensors over a period (Td). Minimizing both losses ensures fairness across regions and over time.
- Core assumption: Fairness in traffic prediction is both spatially and temporally dynamic, requiring separate metrics for static and dynamic fairness.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section]
- Break condition: If traffic conditions change too rapidly or if the temporal window (Td) is not well-chosen, SDF may fail to capture meaningful state consistency, leading to ineffective prolonged fairness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FairTP integrates fairness objectives directly into the training loss, allowing it to maintain high predictive accuracy while improving fairness.
- Mechanism: The overall loss function combines accuracy (MAE), RSF loss, and SDF loss with tunable weights (λ1, λ2). This joint optimization ensures that fairness improvements do not come at the cost of significant accuracy degradation.
- Core assumption: Balancing accuracy and fairness in the loss function can lead to a model that performs well on both objectives simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section]
- Break condition: If the weighting hyperparameters (λ1, λ2) are not properly tuned, the model may either prioritize fairness at the expense of accuracy or vice versa, failing to achieve the desired balance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Spatio-Temporal Data**
  - Why needed here: Traffic prediction inherently involves spatial relationships (road networks) and temporal dependencies (traffic flow over time). GNNs are well-suited to model these complex interactions.
  - Quick check question: How does a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) differ from a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in handling traffic data?

- Concept: **Fairness Metrics in Machine Learning**
  - Why needed here: Ensuring fairness in traffic prediction is crucial for equitable decision-making. Understanding existing fairness metrics (e.g., group fairness, individual fairness) is essential for designing novel metrics like RSF and SDF.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between group fairness and individual fairness, and why might neither be sufficient for dynamic traffic scenarios?

- Concept: **Stratified Sampling**
  - Why needed here: Stratified sampling ensures that the training data is representative of different regions, which is crucial for addressing data imbalances caused by uneven sensor deployment.
  - Quick check question: How does stratified sampling differ from random sampling, and why is it particularly useful in scenarios with imbalanced data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State Identification Module -> State-Guided Balanced Sampling Module -> ST Dependencies Learning Module -> Overall Objective Function

- Critical path: 1. Initialize sampling using stratified sampling. 2. Train the model on the sampled data. 3. Identify sensor states using the state identification module. 4. Adjust sampling probabilities based on sensor states. 5. Repeat steps 2-4 every Td batches. 6. Optimize the composite loss function to improve both accuracy and fairness.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sampling Frequency vs. Model Stability: Frequent sampling adjustments may lead to unstable training, while infrequent adjustments may not adequately address fairness concerns.
  - Fairness vs. Accuracy: Balancing the weights of fairness and accuracy in the loss function is crucial to avoid significant performance degradation in either objective.
  - Computational Cost: The state identification and sampling adjustment processes add computational overhead, which may impact training efficiency.

- Failure signatures:
  - High RSF but Low SDF: Indicates that fairness is achieved at individual time points but not sustained over time.
  - Low RSF but High SDF: Suggests that fairness is maintained over time but not across regions at each time point.
  - Degraded Accuracy: If the model's predictive performance drops significantly after incorporating fairness objectives, the balance in the loss function may be incorrect.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation Study: Remove the state identification module and retrain the model to assess its impact on fairness and accuracy.
  2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different values of λ1 and λ2 to find the optimal balance between accuracy and fairness.
  3. Temporal Analysis: Vary the dynamic time length (Td) to determine its effect on the model's ability to achieve prolonged fairness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out any open questions in the abstract or introduction. The authors focus on presenting their proposed framework and experimental results without discussing specific unresolved issues or directions for future research.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness heavily depends on the accuracy of the state identification module, which could be a critical bottleneck if sensor states cannot be reliably distinguished.
- The computational overhead introduced by the state identification and sampling adjustment processes is not thoroughly analyzed, potentially limiting scalability to large-scale traffic networks.
- The generalizability of results to other traffic scenarios beyond the specific datasets (HK and SD) used in experiments remains uncertain.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The mechanism of achieving prolonged fairness through dynamic sensor sampling adjustments is well-supported by the experimental results, showing significant improvements in both RSF and SDF metrics.
- Medium Confidence: The integration of fairness objectives into the training loss is theoretically sound, but the sensitivity of the results to the weighting hyperparameters (λ1, λ2) is not fully explored.
- Low Confidence: The paper's claims about maintaining or enhancing accuracy while improving fairness are based on specific datasets (HK and SD), and the generalizability of these results to other traffic scenarios remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **State Identification Robustness**: Conduct experiments with varying threshold values for state identification to assess the robustness of the state identification module and its impact on fairness and accuracy.
2. **Computational Efficiency Analysis**: Measure the computational overhead introduced by the FairTP framework and compare it with baseline models to evaluate its scalability for large-scale traffic networks.
3. **Generalizability Test**: Apply the FairTP framework to additional datasets from different geographical regions and traffic conditions to validate its effectiveness across diverse scenarios.
