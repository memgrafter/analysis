core_contribution: This work proposes a taxonomy of pragmatic abilities in LLMs, distinguishing
  between discourse pragmatics (context-dependent meaning inference, figurative speech)
  and interactational pragmatics (turn-taking, politeness, repair) to provide a clearer
  framework for analyzing grounding capabilities. It identifies a gap in systematic
  research on interactional pragmatics despite its relevance to grounding in dialog
  systems, noting that while discourse pragmatic phenomena like implicatures and metaphors
  have been tested using established benchmarks, interactional phenomena lack standardized
  measurement instruments.

# Towards an Analysis of Discourse and Interactional Pragmatic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.03074
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03074
- Authors: Amelie Robrecht; Judith Sieker; Clara Lachenmaier; Sina Zarieß; Stefan Kopp
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Proposes taxonomy distinguishing discourse pragmatics (context-dependent meaning, figurative speech) from interactional pragmatics (turn-taking, politeness, repair) to analyze LLM grounding capabilities

## Executive Summary
This work proposes a structured framework for analyzing pragmatic reasoning capabilities in large language models by distinguishing between discourse pragmatics and interactional pragmatics. The authors identify a significant research gap: while discourse pragmatic phenomena like implicatures and metaphors have established benchmarks, interactional phenomena lack standardized measurement instruments despite their importance for grounding in dialog systems. The paper surveys existing literature, maps tested phenomena to the proposed taxonomy, and calls for more systematic research on interactional pragmatics.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a literature survey of existing research on pragmatic abilities in LLMs, classifying phenomena into discourse pragmatics (context-dependent meaning inference, figurative speech) and interactional pragmatics (turn-taking, politeness, repair). They documented the methods traditionally used to analyze these phenomena and identified patterns in what has been tested versus what remains unexplored. The approach combines theoretical taxonomy development with empirical analysis of research practices in the field.

## Key Results
- Discourse pragmatic phenomena (implicatures, metaphors) have established benchmarks while interactional phenomena lack standardized measurement instruments
- The proposed taxonomy reveals that research on pragmatic abilities in LLMs remains more scarce and less systematic for interactional pragmatics
- Traditional pragmatic analysis methods from psychology and psycholinguistics provide a starting point but may require adaptation for LLM contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The proposed taxonomy provides a clearer framework for analyzing LLM grounding capabilities
- Mechanism: By distinguishing between formal reasoning processes (discourse pragmatics) and conversational reasoning phenomena (interactional pragmatics), the taxonomy creates a structured approach to identify which pragmatic abilities have been tested and which remain underexplored
- Core assumption: The distinction between discourse and interactional pragmatics is both theoretically valid and practically useful for research organization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "distinguishing between discourse pragmatics (context-dependent meaning inference, figurative speech) and interactional pragmatics (turn-taking, politeness, repair)"
  - [section] "We propose to cluster them into two main categories: discourse pragmatics and interactional pragmatics"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on moral reasoning and other pragmatic aspects but don't directly validate this specific taxonomy distinction
- Break condition: If empirical research shows that discourse and interactional pragmatics cannot be meaningfully separated for LLM evaluation purposes, or if new pragmatic phenomena emerge that don't fit either category

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The work identifies a systematic gap in research on interactional pragmatics despite its relevance to grounding in dialog systems
- Mechanism: By surveying existing literature and noting that while discourse pragmatic phenomena have established benchmarks, interactional phenomena lack standardized measurement instruments, the paper highlights an underexplored research area
- Core assumption: Grounding in dialog systems requires both discourse and interactional pragmatic capabilities, and the current research imbalance is problematic
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identifies a gap in systematic research on interactional pragmatics despite its relevance to grounding in dialog systems"
  - [section] "It remains questionable whether these phenomena should be considered part of interactional pragmatics or not"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - corpus includes papers on pragmatics understanding benchmarks but limited focus on interactional aspects specifically
- Break condition: If future research demonstrates that interactional pragmatics are not as critical for grounding as claimed, or if standardized measurement instruments for interactional phenomena are developed and adopted

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The heterogeneous set of phenomena and methods from traditional pragmatics provides a starting point for LLM research
- Mechanism: By mapping established pragmatic phenomena and their traditional analysis methods to the LLM context, the work creates a bridge between linguistic theory and computational implementation
- Core assumption: Traditional pragmatic analysis methods can be adapted for LLM evaluation, even if they were originally developed for human communication
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We give a non-exhaustive overview of the phenomena of those two subdomains and the methods traditionally used to analyze them"
  - [section] "Often, testing instruments – drawing from the field of psychology or psycholinguistics – are established"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors mention various pragmatic approaches but don't specifically validate the adaptation of traditional methods to LLM contexts
- Break condition: If traditional pragmatic analysis methods prove fundamentally incompatible with LLM evaluation, or if new methods emerge that make traditional approaches obsolete

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distinction between semantics and pragmatics
  - Why needed here: The paper operates on the assumption that pragmatics involves meaning beyond literal semantics, which is fundamental to understanding why pragmatic capabilities matter for LLMs
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between semantic meaning and pragmatic meaning in language understanding?

- Concept: Grounding in dialog systems
  - Why needed here: The paper repeatedly connects pragmatic capabilities to grounding, assuming readers understand this concept as it relates to how LLMs maintain coherent conversations
  - Quick check question: How does pragmatic reasoning contribute to grounding in conversational AI systems?

- Concept: Turn-taking and repair mechanisms in conversation
  - Why needed here: These are core interactional pragmatic phenomena mentioned as examples, and understanding them is essential for grasping the interactional pragmatics category
  - Quick check question: What are the basic organizational principles of turn-taking in human conversation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Taxonomy development -> Literature survey -> Gap identification -> Research direction recommendations
- Critical path: 1) Establish theoretical distinction between discourse and interactional pragmatics, 2) Survey existing LLM pragmatic research, 3) Identify gaps and limitations, 4) Propose research directions
- Design tradeoffs: The taxonomy approach trades comprehensive coverage for clarity and manageability. By focusing on two main categories, the paper sacrifices some nuance but gains analytical tractability. Another tradeoff is between qualitative and quantitative research methods - the paper acknowledges that interactional pragmatics often requires qualitative approaches despite the quantitative focus of most LLM research
- Failure signatures: If the taxonomy proves too rigid to accommodate new pragmatic phenomena, if the identified research gaps don't materialize as productive research directions, or if the distinction between discourse and interactional pragmatics doesn't help researchers organize their work effectively
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Survey existing LLM benchmarks to categorize tested pragmatic phenomena according to the proposed taxonomy, documenting which areas are well-represented and which are neglected
  2. Develop a preliminary measurement instrument for one interactional pragmatic phenomenon (e.g., turn-taking or repair) and test it across multiple LLM architectures
  3. Conduct a comparative analysis of LLM performance on discourse vs interactional pragmatic tasks to empirically validate the taxonomy's practical utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific methodologies would be most effective for systematically measuring interactional pragmatic phenomena in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies a gap in standardized measurement instruments for interactional pragmatics, noting that "there is a lack of instruments and measurements" for these phenomena compared to discourse pragmatics
- Why unresolved: Interactional pragmatics involves dynamic, context-dependent phenomena like turn-taking and repair that are harder to capture than the more structured discourse phenomena. The paper acknowledges this challenge but doesn't propose specific solutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new evaluation frameworks specifically designed for interactional phenomena, including protocols for capturing real-time conversational dynamics and measures for assessing turn-taking, repair strategies, and politeness in LLM-generated dialogue

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the grounding capabilities of LLMs differ when tested with discourse versus interactional pragmatic phenomena?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper distinguishes between discourse pragmatics (context-dependent meaning inference, figurative speech) and interactional pragmatics (turn-taking, politeness, repair) and notes that "research on pragmatic abilities in LLMs remains more scarce and less systematic" for interactional phenomena
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes the distinction between these two types of pragmatics, it doesn't provide empirical comparisons of LLM performance across these domains or investigate how these differences impact grounding capabilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring LLM performance on matched sets of discourse and interactional pragmatic tasks, with systematic analysis of how performance differences relate to grounding effectiveness in conversational contexts

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between Theory of Mind capabilities and interactional pragmatic reasoning in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "most research connected to interactional pragmatics focuses on Theory of Mind or related theories" and questions "whether these phenomena should be considered part of interactional pragmatics or not"
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies overlap between Theory of Mind research and interactional pragmatics but doesn't clarify the boundaries or investigate how Theory of Mind capabilities relate to broader interactional pragmatic reasoning
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies mapping Theory of Mind task performance to interactional pragmatic task performance in LLMs, along with theoretical work clarifying the conceptual boundaries between these domains and their relationship to grounding

## Limitations
- The boundary between discourse and interactional pragmatics is fuzzy and could lead to inconsistent classification of phenomena
- Survey methodology is not fully detailed, making it difficult to assess completeness of literature review
- Traditional pragmatic analysis methods may require significant adaptation rather than direct application to LLM contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical distinction between discourse and interactional pragmatics as useful research categories
- Medium confidence: The identification of research gaps in interactional pragmatics measurement instruments
- Low confidence: The claim that traditional pragmatic analysis methods can be directly adapted for LLM evaluation without modification

## Next Checks
1. **Taxonomy validation study**: Conduct a multi-reviewer exercise where different researchers independently classify the same set of pragmatic phenomena using the proposed taxonomy, measuring inter-rater agreement to assess the taxonomy's clarity and usability

2. **Benchmark gap analysis**: Systematically catalog all existing LLM benchmarks that test pragmatic capabilities, categorizing them according to the discourse/interactional framework to empirically verify the claimed research imbalance

3. **Method adaptation feasibility test**: Select one traditional pragmatic analysis method (e.g., discourse completion tasks) and attempt to adapt it for LLM evaluation, documenting successes, failures, and necessary modifications to assess the validity of the adaptation assumption
