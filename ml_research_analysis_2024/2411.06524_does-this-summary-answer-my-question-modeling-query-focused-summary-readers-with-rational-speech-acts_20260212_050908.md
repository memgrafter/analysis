# Does This Summary Answer My Question? Modeling Query-Focused Summary Readers with Rational Speech Acts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06524
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06524
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: RSA-based answer reconstruction consistently outperforms reader-unaware approaches across three QFS datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an RSA framework adaptation for query-focused summarization that models readers through an answer reconstruction objective. The approach re-ranks candidate summaries based on their ability to enable QA systems to generate answers without the source document. Applied to BART and Llama 3 across MultiOpEd, QMSum, and SQuALITY datasets, the method consistently outperformed baselines with higher ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore scores. The answer reconstruction objective proved more effective than source reconstruction, and combining both yielded optimal results.

## Method Summary
The method adapts the Rational Speech Act framework to query-focused summarization by introducing an answer reconstruction objective. Candidate summaries are generated using existing QFS systems (BART/Llama 3), then re-ranked based on a QA system's ability to reconstruct the original answer from the summary alone. A rationality parameter λ interpolates between literal summarizer likelihood and reader reconstruction likelihood, with answer reconstruction proving more effective than source reconstruction for this task.

## Key Results
- Answer reconstruction objective consistently outperformed reader-unaware approaches across three datasets
- Answer reconstruction was more effective than source reconstruction for query-focused summaries
- Combining answer and source reconstruction objectives with optimal λ yielded the best performance
- The approach achieved higher ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore scores than baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Answer reconstruction explicitly models user understanding by scoring summaries based on their ability to enable QA systems to generate answers without the source document.
- Mechanism: During re-ranking, candidate summaries are scored by the probability that a QA system can generate the original answer using only the summary, rather than the full document.
- Core assumption: A good query-focused summary contains the minimal information needed to answer the query.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "answer reconstruction objective which approximates a reader's understanding of a summary by their ability to use it to reconstruct the answer to their initial query"
  - [section 3]: "We think of existing QFS systems as literal summarizers since, similar to the original RSA formulation, they do not directly consider the readers of their summaries."
- Break condition: If the QA system is unreliable or the answer requires information explicitly excluded from the summary, the answer reconstruction score becomes misleading.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining literal summarizer likelihood with reader reconstruction likelihood via a rationality parameter λ balances content coverage and query relevance.
- Mechanism: Final summary score = (literal summarizer likelihood)^(1-λ) × (reader reconstruction likelihood)^λ
- Core assumption: Both content coverage (literal summarizer) and query relevance (reader reconstruction) are necessary for high-quality summaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3]: "a rationality parameter λ ∈ [0, 1] is used by S1 to regulate the importance assigned to R1's answer reconstruction ability"
  - [section 5]: "using a rationality parameter which optimally interpolates between S0 and R1 consistently leads to performance improvements"
- Break condition: If λ is set too high, summaries may become overly focused on answering the query at the expense of broader content; if too low, query relevance is ignored.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The answer reconstruction objective is more effective than source reconstruction because it aligns with the intended use case of query-focused summaries.
- Mechanism: Unlike source reconstruction which scores based on ability to recreate the full document, answer reconstruction scores based on ability to answer the specific query.
- Core assumption: Query-focused summaries should prioritize answering the query over preserving all source content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our method's answer reconstruction objective is directly defined through a query-focused summary's intended use case: as a way of informing the user about their posed query"
  - [section 5]: "the answer reconstruction objective, which reflects the downstream use of query-focused summaries, is a more beneficial reader model than the generic source reconstruction objective"
- Break condition: If users actually need comprehensive document coverage rather than just query answers, source reconstruction might be more appropriate.

## Foundational Learning

- Rational Speech Act framework
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical foundation for modeling how speakers (summarizers) generate utterances (summaries) that listeners (readers) can understand in context
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of RSA framework and how do they map to QFS?

- Question answering systems
  - Why needed here: Used to measure reader's ability to reconstruct answers from summaries, serving as proxy for understanding
  - Quick check question: How does the QA system score function as a "reader model" in this approach?

- ROUGE and other summarization metrics
  - Why needed here: Evaluation metrics to measure how well re-ranked summaries align with reference summaries
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Literal summarizer (BART/Llama 3) -> generates candidate summaries -> QA system (Llama 3) -> generates answers and scores summaries -> Rationality parameter λ -> Re-ranking mechanism -> selects best summary

- Critical path:
  1. Generate n candidate summaries from literal summarizer
  2. Generate answer from QA system using original document
  3. Score each candidate summary using QA system
  4. Compute combined score with λ
  5. Select highest-scoring summary

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More candidates → better selection but higher computation
  - Higher λ → more query-focused but potentially less comprehensive
  - QA system quality → directly impacts answer reconstruction accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - Summaries become too short/tailored to answer only
  - QA system hallucinations propagate to summary selection
  - Literal summarizer quality varies significantly across domains

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare random selection vs literal summarizer only vs answer reconstruction only
  2. Sweep λ values to find optimal balance point
  3. Compare answer reconstruction vs source reconstruction performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do reader models based on the RSA framework perform when applied to other user-centered language generation tasks beyond query-focused summarization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude by suggesting that existing language generation systems could better serve their users by explicitly considering them during the generation process
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the approach on three query-focused summarization datasets. No experiments were conducted on other user-centered tasks like personalized generation, instruction following, or conversational AI.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of RSA-based reader models across diverse user-centered NLP tasks, measuring improvements in both task-specific metrics and user satisfaction scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between answer reconstruction and source reconstruction objectives when both are combined in a hybrid approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that combining both objectives yielded the best results, but only tested a limited set of interpolation values
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a dynamic computation for λ but only tests a fixed set of α values. The interaction between these parameters across different datasets and models remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive grid search or Bayesian optimization over both λ and α parameters across multiple datasets and model architectures, measuring both summarization quality and text quality metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of RSA-based reader models change when using different QA systems or when gold answers are available?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that using a QA generation system rather than gold answers introduces noise, but they limited their exploration to a single QA system (Llama 3)
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses Llama 3 for both summarization and QA tasks, preventing isolation of the impact of the QA system choice on overall performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using multiple QA systems (both neural and non-neural), as well as experiments with oracle gold answers, to measure the contribution of QA quality to the final summarization performance.

## Limitations

- Answer reconstruction depends heavily on QA system quality, creating a potential single point of failure
- The rationality parameter λ requires dataset-specific tuning, suggesting limited transferability across domains
- The approach increases computational cost by requiring multiple candidate summaries and QA system scoring

## Confidence

- **High**: The core mechanism of answer reconstruction outperforming source reconstruction, as this is directly supported by empirical results across three datasets
- **Medium**: The claim that RSA framework provides a principled theoretical foundation, as this depends on acceptance of RSA as the appropriate model for summarization
- **Medium**: The assertion that combining both objectives yields best results, as optimal λ values vary and the improvement may be dataset-dependent

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test whether the optimal λ values identified for one dataset transfer to others, or if dataset-specific tuning remains necessary. This would reveal whether the approach generalizes beyond the three studied datasets.

2. **QA system robustness analysis**: Systematically evaluate how variations in QA system quality (different models, different prompts) affect answer reconstruction scores and downstream summary quality. This would quantify the sensitivity to this critical component.

3. **Real user study**: Conduct user studies comparing summaries selected via answer reconstruction versus traditional metrics to verify that the theoretical improvements in query-alignment translate to actual user satisfaction and task completion.
