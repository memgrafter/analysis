# AEye: A Visualization Tool for Image Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04072
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Web-based tool for exploring large image datasets through semantically meaningful embeddings and hierarchical visualization

## Executive Summary
AEye is a web-based visualization tool designed to enable intuitive exploration of large-scale image datasets through semantically meaningful embeddings. The tool leverages CLIP for generating embeddings, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and a hierarchical layered approach with k-means clustering to manage visual complexity. AEye supports both text and image-based semantic search using vector databases and provides AI-generated captions via LLaVA integration. The system is demonstrated on the COCO dataset and shown to handle over 100k images with preprocessing taking only a few hours on commodity hardware.

## Method Summary
AEye preprocesses image datasets by first generating CLIP embeddings that capture semantic meaning, then projecting these high-dimensional representations to 2D space using UMAP while preserving local and global structure. The tool employs a hierarchical visualization strategy with multiple zoom levels, where each level displays representative images selected through a modified k-means clustering algorithm that maintains visual continuity across layers. A vector database stores the embeddings to enable efficient semantic search for both text and image queries. The system also integrates LLaVA for generating AI captions for images. The preprocessing pipeline is designed to be efficient, allowing exploration of large datasets (100k+ images) within reasonable time frames on standard hardware.

## Key Results
- Successfully visualizes and explores large-scale image datasets (tested with COCO 2017, MNIST, CelebA-HQ)
- Handles over 100k images with preprocessing taking only a few hours on commodity hardware
- Enables semantic search using both text and image queries through vector database integration
- Reveals dataset patterns, outliers, and potential biases through hierarchical visualization approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLIP embeddings preserve semantic meaning of images, enabling meaningful clustering and search
- Mechanism: Contrastive learning trains CLIP on paired image-text data, learning to embed both modalities into a shared latent space where similar concepts are close together
- Core assumption: The diverse internet image-text pairs used for training CLIP generalize well to the target dataset's domain
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AEye utilizes a contrastively trained model to embed images into semantically meaningful high-dimensional representations, facilitating data clustering and organization"
  - [section] "CLIP embeddings effectively preserve the semantic meaning of images by encoding rich semantic information learned during pretraining"
- Break condition: If the target dataset contains images or concepts significantly different from CLIP's training data, embeddings may not capture meaningful semantic relationships

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: UMAP projection preserves both local and global structure of high-dimensional embeddings in 2D space
- Mechanism: UMAP constructs a fuzzy topological representation of the high-dimensional data and finds a low-dimensional embedding that best preserves this topology
- Core assumption: The embedding space manifold structure can be approximated in 2D while maintaining meaningful relationships
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we select UMAP due to its ability to preserve the data's local and global structure. Unlike traditional methods like PCA, which primarily focus on preserving variance, UMAP aims to capture the underlying manifold structure of the data"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found about UMAP's effectiveness for this specific application, but it's a well-established dimensionality reduction technique
- Break condition: If the embedding space has very complex manifold structure, 2D projection may distort relationships beyond usefulness

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical layered visualization with k-means clustering enables exploration of large image datasets without overwhelming the user
- Mechanism: Images are organized in multiple zoom levels, each showing representatives from k-means clusters, allowing users to navigate from coarse to fine-grained views
- Core assumption: k-means clustering with fixed centroids from previous layers maintains visual continuity across zoom levels
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We adopt a hierarchical strategy comprising multiple layers... Within each tile, a fixed predefined number k of images serves as representatives, approximately corresponding to the number of images visible on screen at any time"
  - [section] "To maintain consistency in representatives across layers, we modify the k-mean algorithm by retaining the positions of representatives from previous layers as fixed centroids throughout the algorithm's execution"
- Break condition: If k is too small, important variations may be lost; if too large, the visualization becomes cluttered

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning and CLIP embeddings
  - Why needed here: Understanding how CLIP creates semantically meaningful representations is crucial for grasping why AEye can organize and search images effectively
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between contrastive learning and traditional supervised learning approaches for image representations?

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP vs t-SNE vs PCA)
  - Why needed here: Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of different projection methods helps understand why UMAP was chosen for this application
  - Quick check question: How does UMAP's approach to preserving manifold structure differ from t-SNE's focus on local neighborhoods?

- Concept: Vector databases and nearest neighbor search
  - Why needed here: Understanding how semantic search works requires knowledge of how high-dimensional embeddings are indexed and queried efficiently
  - Quick check question: Why are specialized vector databases needed for semantic search instead of traditional relational databases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CLIP embedding generation → Vector database storage → UMAP projection → Hierarchical clustering computation → Web application serving
- Critical path:
  1. CLIP embedding generation (bottleneck for large datasets)
  2. UMAP projection computation
  3. Hierarchical clustering computation for all layers
  4. Vector database population
  5. Web application serving

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Preprocessing time vs. real-time performance: Heavy preprocessing enables fast interactive exploration
  - Layer count vs. representation fidelity: More layers provide better detail but increase complexity
  - k value vs. screen density: Larger k shows more variety but risks clutter

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor semantic clustering: Indicates CLIP embeddings don't capture meaningful relationships for this dataset
  - Distorted UMAP projection: May suggest embedding space is too complex for 2D representation
  - Search returning irrelevant results: Could indicate vector database indexing issues or CLIP text encoder limitations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CLIP embeddings on a small subset of the target dataset to verify semantic meaningfulness
  2. Run UMAP on a sample of embeddings to check projection quality and layer structure
  3. Implement basic hierarchical visualization with a small dataset to verify zooming and layering functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does AEye's scalability compare to other large-scale image visualization tools when handling datasets exceeding 100k images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states AEye can handle over 100k images with preprocessing taking only a few hours on commodity hardware, but does not provide direct comparisons to other tools.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include benchmark comparisons with other visualization tools for large-scale image datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing AEye's processing time and memory usage against other visualization tools (e.g., Embedding Projector, VisAtlas) when handling datasets of varying sizes (10k, 50k, 100k+ images).

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of layers (d) for different dataset sizes, and how does this affect user experience and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the number of layers scales logarithmically with the number of images but does not provide specific guidelines for optimal layer configuration.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how different layer configurations impact user navigation experience or computational requirements across various dataset sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing different layer configurations (varying k and d) across datasets of different sizes, measuring both user task completion times and computational resource usage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How effective is AEye at detecting subtle biases in image datasets compared to specialized bias detection tools?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While AEye demonstrates ability to identify outliers and labeling errors in the COCO dataset case study, the paper does not compare its bias detection capabilities against dedicated bias detection tools like REVISE.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents AEye's ability to reveal patterns and outliers but does not validate its effectiveness for bias detection against established methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring AEye's performance in detecting known biases (gender, racial, etc.) in benchmark datasets against specialized bias detection tools, using precision and recall metrics.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on CLIP embedding quality for specific dataset domains, not validated across diverse image types
- K-means clustering may oversimplify complex semantic relationships, particularly for datasets with high intra-class variability
- Current implementation focuses on static datasets without support for dynamic updates or incremental learning

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core technical implementation (CLIP embeddings, UMAP projection, vector database search) follows established methods with clear theoretical foundations
- **Medium confidence**: The modified k-means clustering approach for representative selection is reasonable but lacks extensive validation across different dataset characteristics
- **Medium confidence**: The case study demonstrates utility but is limited to a single dataset (COCO), requiring broader testing for generalizability

## Next Checks
1. Test AEye with datasets from domains significantly different from COCO (e.g., medical images, satellite imagery) to evaluate CLIP embedding effectiveness across diverse image types
2. Conduct user studies comparing AEye's exploration efficiency against baseline methods (random sampling, metadata-based filtering) across datasets of varying complexity
3. Measure the impact of UMAP hyperparameters and layer count on visualization quality and exploration effectiveness through systematic ablation studies
