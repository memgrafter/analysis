# Crossroads of Continents: Automated Artifact Extraction for Cultural Adaptation with Large Multimodal Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.02067
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02067
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: LLaVA and GPT-4V outperform humans on cultural awareness benchmarks; CULTUREADAPT adapts images to target cultures with fine-grained edits

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive study on cultural understanding in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) through three interconnected phases. First, it introduces DALLESTREET, a large-scale dataset of 9,935 images covering 67 countries and 10 concept classes, generated by DALL-E 3 and validated by humans. Second, it proposes a cultural artifact extraction task using tf-idf scoring to identify implicit associations between cultures and artifacts, analyzing over 18,000 artifacts to reveal stereotypical cultural associations. Third, it introduces CULTUREADAPT, a modular pipeline that adapts images to target cultures by modifying detected cultural associations using diffusion-based inpainting. The study finds disparities in LMM cultural understanding across geographic sub-regions, with GPT-4V performing better than LLaVA on DALL-E 3 images, and demonstrates successful cultural adaptation while maintaining structural similarity.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a three-phase methodology for cultural understanding in LMMs. First, DALLESTREET is generated using DALL-E 3 with specific prompt templates covering 67 countries and 10 concept classes, then validated by human annotators. Second, cultural artifact extraction employs GPT-4V to detect objects in images, followed by tf-idf scoring to identify culturally salient artifacts based on their frequency and uniqueness across countries. Third, CULTUREADAPT implements a modular pipeline combining GPT-4V for object detection, Grounding DINO for bounding box generation, and Stable Diffusion for inpainting to adapt images to target cultures while preserving structural similarity through CLIPScore and DINO-ViT metrics.

## Key Results
- LLaVA and GPT-4V outperform humans on cultural awareness classification tasks with accuracies of 69.13% and 83.56% respectively
- Cultural artifact extraction reveals stereotypical associations, with some artifacts showing tf-idf scores exceeding one standard deviation from the mean
- CULTUREADAPT outperforms baseline methods in cultural relevance adaptation while maintaining structural similarity, with 54% of samples meeting cultural relevance criteria versus 50% for baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4V outperforms LLaVA on DALL-E 3 images because DALL-E 3's generated images include stereotypical associations that GPT-4V is better at recognizing.
- Mechanism: GPT-4V has stronger visual instruction-following capabilities and can better extract cultural artifacts from hyper-realistic synthetic images, while LLaVA struggles with the same task.
- Core assumption: The performance difference is due to the models' ability to recognize stereotypical cultural cues rather than their general visual understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We find disparities in cultural understanding at geographic sub-region levels with both open-source (LLaVA) and closed-source (GPT-4V) models"
  - [section 3.2] "On the MARVL data, LLaVA performs about as good as random guessing. This may be because MARVL covers specific indigenous concepts that the model may not have seen before"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on cultural alignment but don't directly compare LLaVA vs GPT-4V performance
- Break condition: If LLaVA's performance on DALL-E 3 images matches GPT-4V's, the mechanism would need revision.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The tf-idf score effectively identifies culturally salient artifacts by measuring how frequently they co-occur for specific countries.
- Mechanism: Artifacts with high tf-idf scores are more likely to be culturally distinctive because they appear frequently in images from one country but rarely in others.
- Core assumption: Frequency of co-occurrence is a reliable proxy for cultural salience, even if some associations are stereotypical.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "Some cultural artifacts are strongly tied to specific countries, with certain artifacts exceeding one standard deviation from the mean tf-idf score"
  - [section 4.2] "Our method effectively surfaces implicit associations but also highlights challenges with stereotype reinforcement"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - related papers don't use tf-idf for cultural artifact extraction
- Break condition: If human validation shows low correlation between high tf-idf scores and cultural relevance, the mechanism would need revision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CULTURE ADAPT successfully adapts images by modifying detected cultural associations while maintaining structural similarity.
- Mechanism: The modular pipeline uses GPT-4V for object detection, Grounding DINO for bounding box generation, and Stable Diffusion for inpainting to make targeted cultural edits without changing the overall image structure.
- Core assumption: Diffusion-based inpainting can effectively modify cultural elements while preserving the rest of the image.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] "CULTURE ADAPT outperformed cap-edit in a statistically significant way"
  - [section 5.2] "For M1, 54% of samples met the condition versus 50% for cap-edit"
  - [section 5.2] "In a human study of 100 images, 3 participants rated both methods equally preferable on structure preservation"
- Break condition: If CLIPScore-based metrics show that edited images are not closer to target cultures, the mechanism would need revision.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural artifact extraction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to identify implicit cultural associations is crucial for both benchmarking LMMs and developing cultural adaptation methods
  - Quick check question: How does tf-idf scoring help identify culturally salient artifacts?

- Concept: Zero-shot classification
  - Why needed here: The cultural awareness task uses zero-shot prompting to classify images by geographical region without providing answer choices
  - Quick check question: Why might the model default to "policy violation" responses for some images?

- Concept: Diffusion-based inpainting
  - Why needed here: CULTURE ADAPT relies on diffusion models to modify cultural elements in images while preserving structural similarity
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of using Stable Diffusion for cultural adaptation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DALL-E 3 generation → Cultural awareness benchmark → Artifact extraction → Cultural adaptation pipeline
- Critical path: Artifact extraction (GPT-4V) → Grounding DINO → Stable Diffusion inpainting → CLIPScore evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using closed-source models (GPT-4V) vs. open-source alternatives (LLaVA, Stable Diffusion)
- Failure signatures: Poor artifact extraction leads to ineffective cultural adaptation; CLIPScore may not capture all aspects of cultural relevance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare LLaVA vs GPT-4V performance on DALL-E 3 images to understand model differences
  2. Test tf-idf scoring with human validation to refine artifact extraction
  3. Implement and test CULTUREADAPT with different diffusion models (Stable Diffusion vs DALL-E 3)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do cultural associations and artifact recognition differ between open-source and closed-source LMMs, and what underlying factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares LLaVA and GPT-4V performances on cultural awareness tasks and artifact extraction, finding disparities in their abilities to recognize and differentiate cultures.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies performance differences but doesn't deeply investigate the underlying factors contributing to these differences, such as training data composition, model architecture, or fine-tuning approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis comparing the training datasets, architectures, and fine-tuning processes of open-source and closed-source LMMs, coupled with controlled experiments varying these factors, would provide insights into the root causes of performance disparities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can cultural adaptation techniques like CULTURE ADAPT be extended to preserve fine-grained cultural nuances beyond object-level changes, such as style, composition, and implicit cultural cues?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on object-level changes in cultural adaptation but acknowledges limitations in preserving realism and human faces, suggesting potential for extending the approach to capture more subtle cultural elements.
- Why unresolved: The current approach primarily targets object-level changes, and while it shows promise, it doesn't fully address the preservation of broader cultural nuances that contribute to the overall feel and meaning of an image.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying CULTURE ADAPT to images with complex cultural elements, such as traditional ceremonies, artistic styles, or architectural details, and evaluating the preservation of these nuances using both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments by cultural experts, would demonstrate the approach's ability to capture fine-grained cultural elements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do economic disparities influence cultural understanding in LMMs, and can models be developed to mitigate potential biases arising from these disparities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study reveals that LMMs perform differently across income quartiles in various regions, suggesting potential biases in their cultural understanding based on economic contexts.
- Why unresolved: While the study identifies disparities, it doesn't explore the mechanisms behind these biases or propose methods to address them, leaving open the question of how to develop more equitable cultural understanding in LMMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating the relationship between economic indicators and cultural representation in training data, coupled with experiments fine-tuning models on balanced datasets that account for economic diversity, would provide insights into mitigating biases and promoting fairer cultural understanding.

## Limitations
- Limited human evaluation scale (100 images) may not capture full variability in cultural understanding
- tf-idf-based artifact extraction may capture stereotypical rather than authentic cultural associations
- Reliance on multiple closed-source APIs (GPT-4V, Grounding DINO) creates reproducibility concerns

## Confidence
- Benchmark performance claims (High): The classification accuracy metrics and tf-idf analysis are well-documented with clear statistical significance
- Cultural adaptation claims (Medium): While CULTUREADAPT outperforms baselines in controlled experiments, the human evaluation sample size and potential prompt engineering effects limit generalizability
- Artifact extraction methodology (Medium): The tf-idf approach is statistically sound but may conflate frequency with cultural significance without additional validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-model generalization test**: Evaluate CULTUREADAPT using open-source alternatives (e.g., LLaVA, Segment Anything) to verify that performance improvements aren't solely dependent on GPT-4V's capabilities

2. **Stereotype vs. authenticity validation**: Conduct targeted human studies to distinguish between stereotypical and authentic cultural associations, particularly for high-tf-idf artifacts that may reflect cultural clichés rather than genuine cultural understanding

3. **Long-tail cultural performance analysis**: Systematically evaluate model performance on underrepresented cultures and indigenous concepts that showed poor performance in the MARVL subset, identifying specific failure patterns for improvement
