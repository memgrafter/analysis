# Joint PET-MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion Stochastic Differential Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11840
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11840
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: JR-diffusion model achieves superior PET-MRI reconstruction quality compared to traditional methods under undersampling conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel diffusion stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework for joint PET-MRI reconstruction that learns the statistical correlation between modalities through a score-based diffusion model. The approach addresses the challenge of undersampled data acquisition by leveraging the complementary information from both PET and MRI to generate high-quality reconstructions. The model was validated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional Linear Parallel Level Sets (LPLS) and supervised deep learning methods like Joint ISTA-Net, particularly under 3-fold and 5-fold Cartesian undersampling conditions.

## Method Summary
The JR-diffusion model employs a score-based diffusion framework that learns the joint probability distribution between PET and MRI modalities through forward and reverse diffusion processes. The forward diffusion gradually adds Gaussian noise to transform clean images into a known prior distribution, while the reverse diffusion removes noise to recover the original data distribution. The reconstruction framework maximizes posterior probability using the learned joint distribution as a prior, with the separability assumption allowing reconstruction of one modality conditioned on the other. The model was trained on 167 individuals with 5010 image pairs from the ADNI dataset, specifically addressing undersampled data from both modalities to accelerate MRI acquisition and improve PET image quality.

## Key Results
- JR-diffusion model outperforms traditional LPLS and Joint ISTA-Net methods in both PET and MRI reconstruction quality
- Demonstrated superior performance under 3-fold and 5-fold Cartesian undersampling in k-space and sinograms
- Qualitative and quantitative improvements in reconstruction metrics, with accuracy in learning joint probability distributions identified as the primary driver of performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The diffusion SDE framework learns the joint probability distribution between PET and MRI modalities through forward and reverse diffusion processes. The forward process gradually adds Gaussian noise to transform clean images into a known prior distribution, while the reverse process removes noise to recover the original data distribution. This learned joint distribution serves as a prior for joint reconstruction, capturing the statistical correlation between modalities.

### Mechanism 2
Undersampled data from both modalities can be reconstructed by conditioning on the learned joint probability distribution. The posterior probability is simplified using a separability assumption, allowing reconstruction of one modality conditioned on the other through the learned distribution. This factorization enables efficient computation of the reconstruction target.

### Mechanism 3
The complementary information from both modalities improves reconstruction quality compared to single-modality reconstruction. MRI provides high spatial resolution anatomical information while PET provides functional information, and the joint model leverages both to generate superior reconstructions than either modality alone.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Diffusion probabilistic models and score-based generative modeling
  - Why needed here: The entire reconstruction approach relies on understanding how diffusion SDEs work to learn probability distributions
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between forward and reverse diffusion processes in score-based models?

- **Concept**: Bayesian inference and posterior probability estimation
  - Why needed here: The reconstruction framework is based on maximizing posterior probability using learned priors
  - Quick check question: How does the separability assumption in the joint likelihood affect the posterior formulation?

- **Concept**: Compressed sensing and undersampling in k-space
  - Why needed here: The model is specifically designed to handle undersampled MRI k-space data and PET sinograms
  - Quick check question: What aliasing artifacts would you expect from 3-fold and 5-fold undersampling in Cartesian k-space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Forward diffusion process → Score network → Reverse diffusion process → Joint reconstruction output; PET forward operator (Radon transform) and MRI forward operator (Fourier transform) as measurement models
- **Critical path**: Undersampled PET/MRI data → Forward diffusion noise addition → Score network training → Reverse diffusion denoising → Reconstructed PET/MRI images
- **Design tradeoffs**: Diffusion models are computationally intensive but provide superior generative quality; requires large training datasets (167 individuals, 5010 pairs used here)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor reconstruction quality at high undersampling factors; mode collapse in generated images; inability to capture fine anatomical details
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement forward diffusion process on synthetic clean PET/MRI pairs and verify noise addition
  2. Train score network on single modality (MRI only) to verify basic diffusion model functionality
  3. Implement joint reconstruction on small dataset with 2-fold undersampling to verify framework before scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense, but several important research directions remain unexplored based on the methodology and results presented.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (167 individuals, 5010 image pairs) may not capture full diversity of PET-MRI acquisitions across different populations and imaging protocols
- Separability assumption in joint likelihood formulation not empirically validated, raising questions about model applicability to more complex multimodal relationships
- Computational complexity of diffusion models during inference not addressed, potentially limiting clinical deployment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Basic framework of using diffusion models for joint PET-MRI reconstruction, superior performance compared to traditional methods (LPLS and Joint ISTA-Net), validation on ADNI dataset
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism by which joint probability distribution learning improves reconstruction quality, specific contribution of separability assumption in posterior formulation
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of results to different datasets, computational efficiency claims, model's robustness to varying undersampling patterns beyond Cartesian sampling

## Next Checks
1. Validate the JR-diffusion model on an independent PET-MRI dataset (e.g., from a different medical center or disease population) to assess robustness beyond the ADNI cohort
2. Conduct ablation studies to empirically test the impact of different joint likelihood factorizations on reconstruction quality
3. Measure wall-clock inference time and memory requirements for JR-diffusion compared to baseline methods, and evaluate potential optimization strategies for clinical deployment
