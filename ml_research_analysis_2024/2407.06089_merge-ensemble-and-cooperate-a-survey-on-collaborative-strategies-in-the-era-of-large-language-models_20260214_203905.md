# Merge, Ensemble, and Cooperate! A Survey on Collaborative Strategies in the Era of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06089
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06089
- Reference count: 40
- This paper surveys collaborative strategies for large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into three main approaches: merging, ensemble, and cooperation

## Executive Summary
This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of collaborative strategies for large language models (LLMs), organizing them into three distinct categories: merging, ensemble, and cooperation. The authors systematically review various methods within each category, highlighting how these approaches leverage the strengths of multiple LLMs to enhance performance and capabilities. The paper serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand the landscape of collaborative LLM strategies and their potential applications.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic literature review approach to identify and categorize collaborative strategies for large language models. The authors conducted an extensive search of academic literature and industry publications to gather relevant methods and techniques. They then organized these findings into three main categories based on the underlying collaborative mechanism: merging (combining parameters of multiple LLMs into a unified model), ensemble (combining outputs of different LLMs), and cooperation (leveraging diverse LLM capabilities to achieve specific objectives). The review includes detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category, along with discussions of their advantages, limitations, and potential applications.

## Key Results
- The paper categorizes collaborative LLM strategies into three main approaches: merging, ensemble, and cooperation
- Merging involves integrating multiple LLMs into a unified model by combining their parameters
- Ensemble combines the outputs of different LLMs, while cooperation leverages diverse LLM capabilities to achieve specific objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The collaborative strategies for LLMs work by leveraging the complementary strengths and diverse capabilities of multiple models. Merging strategies combine the parameter space of different LLMs, effectively creating a more comprehensive knowledge base and diverse reasoning capabilities. Ensemble methods work by aggregating outputs from multiple models, which can reduce individual model biases and improve overall robustness through consensus mechanisms. Cooperation strategies enable task-specific optimization by assigning different roles or specializations to different LLMs, allowing them to work together more effectively than any single model could alone.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Parameter Space Integration** - why needed: To combine knowledge from multiple models without retraining; quick check: Verify parameter compatibility across models
2. **Output Aggregation Methods** - why needed: To effectively combine predictions from multiple models; quick check: Test different voting/weighting schemes
3. **Specialization Assignment** - why needed: To optimize cooperative workflows; quick check: Validate task allocation efficiency

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM Models -> Merging Layer -> Unified Model
LLM Models -> Ensemble Layer -> Aggregated Output
LLM Models -> Cooperation Layer -> Task-specific Output

Critical Path:
Model Selection → Strategy Selection → Integration Method → Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Merging: Parameter compatibility vs. model diversity
- Ensemble: Aggregation complexity vs. performance gain
- Cooperation: Communication overhead vs. specialization benefits

Failure Signatures:
- Merging: Parameter conflicts, loss of individual model characteristics
- Ensemble: Over-aggregation, dilution of strong individual predictions
- Cooperation: Communication bottlenecks, misaligned task allocation

First Experiments:
1. Compare single LLM vs. merged model on standard benchmark
2. Test ensemble voting vs. weighted averaging methods
3. Evaluate cooperation efficiency with varying task complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The review appears highly selective, potentially missing emerging or less mainstream collaborative methods
- Boundaries between categories may not be distinct in practice, especially as hybrid approaches emerge
- Limited coverage of real-world implementations and performance benchmarks makes practical effectiveness difficult to assess

## Confidence
- High confidence in the general categorization framework of merging, ensemble, and cooperation as distinct collaborative approaches
- Medium confidence in the comprehensiveness of the surveyed methods, as selection criteria are not fully transparent
- Low confidence in comparative effectiveness claims between strategies due to limited empirical data presented

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic literature review using broader search terms to identify additional collaborative strategies not covered in this survey
2. Perform empirical benchmarking of at least three representative methods from each collaborative category using standardized datasets and evaluation metrics
3. Analyze real-world deployment cases where collaborative LLM strategies have been implemented to assess practical challenges and benefits beyond theoretical frameworks
