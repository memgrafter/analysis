# Towards Multimodal Open-Set Domain Generalization and Adaptation through Self-supervision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01518
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01518
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MOOSA achieves up to 7.78% improvement in harmonic mean for known and unknown class accuracy on EPIC-Kitchens and HAC datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Multimodal Open-Set Domain Generalization (MM-OSDG) problem, where models must generalize to unseen target domains containing both known and unknown classes. The authors propose MOOSA, a novel approach using two self-supervised pretext tasks - Masked Cross-modal Translation and Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles - to leverage intrinsic data distributions across modalities for robust feature learning. An entropy weighting mechanism balances modality contributions. Extensive experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and HAC datasets demonstrate MOOSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.78% improvement in harmonic mean (HOS) for known and unknown class accuracy. The approach is also extended to Multimodal Open-Set Domain Adaptation (MM-OSDA) and multimodal closed-set domain generalization settings.

## Method Summary
The MOOSA framework addresses MM-OSDG by combining multimodal feature extraction with self-supervised pretext tasks. It uses SlowFast networks for video/optical flow and ResNet-18 for audio, initialized with pre-trained weights. The method extracts modality-specific and modality-shared features, then applies two self-supervised tasks: Masked Cross-modal Translation (reconstructing 70% masked features across modalities) and Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles (reordering shuffled embedding parts across 4 splits with 128 permutations). An entropy weighting mechanism balances modality contributions during training. The loss function combines classification loss, self-supervised losses, and entropy minimization, optimized using Adam with learning rate 0.0001.

## Key Results
- MOOSA achieves up to 7.78% improvement in harmonic mean (HOS) compared to state-of-the-art methods
- The approach demonstrates superior performance on both EPIC-Kitchens and HAC datasets with three modalities each
- Extended results show effectiveness in Multimodal Open-Set Domain Adaptation (MM-OSDA) and closed-set domain generalization settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging intrinsic data distributions across multiple modalities to learn robust, domain-invariant features. The two self-supervised tasks complement each other: Masked Cross-modal Translation captures cross-modal relationships useful for open-class detection, while Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles enforces local-global consistency for domain generalization. The entropy weighting mechanism dynamically balances modality contributions based on their uncertainty, allowing the model to adaptively focus on more reliable modalities during training.

## Foundational Learning

**Self-supervised learning**: Understanding pretext tasks that create auxiliary training signals without labels is essential for implementing the two core tasks in MOOSA. Quick check: Can you explain how masked autoencoding works?

**Domain generalization**: The concept of learning features that generalize across unseen domains is fundamental to the problem setting. Quick check: What's the difference between domain adaptation and domain generalization?

**Modality fusion**: Understanding how to effectively combine information from multiple data modalities is crucial for the multimodal aspect. Quick check: How does early fusion differ from late fusion in multimodal learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Video/Optical Flow features -> SlowFast networks -> Modality-specific and shared features -> Self-supervised tasks -> Classification head; Audio features -> ResNet-18 -> Modality-specific and shared features -> Self-supervised tasks -> Classification head

**Critical path**: Input data -> Modality-specific feature extraction -> Modality-shared feature extraction -> Self-supervised tasks (Masked Cross-modal Translation + Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles) -> Entropy weighting -> Classification head

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice between early vs. late fusion affects how modalities interact; the balance between self-supervised task complexity and computational efficiency impacts training time; the masking ratio in Masked Cross-modal Translation trades off between reconstruction difficulty and information preservation.

**Failure signatures**: Poor unknown class detection indicates insufficient separation between known and unknown distributions; degraded multimodal performance suggests entropy weighting isn't properly balancing contributions; high entropy in predictions across modalities indicates the model isn't confident in its decisions.

**First experiments**:
1. Implement and test the SlowFast and ResNet-18 feature extractors independently on each modality
2. Validate the Masked Cross-modal Translation task with a single modality pair before extending to all three
3. Test the Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles task on extracted features to ensure permutation classification works correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How do different masking ratios in Masked Cross-modal Translation affect open-class detection performance across varying dataset characteristics? The paper only explores one fixed masking ratio (0.7) without examining how different ratios might perform on datasets with varying characteristics.

**Open Question 2**: What is the theoretical relationship between the proposed self-supervised tasks and their effectiveness in capturing domain-invariant features versus open-class discriminative features? While empirical results show effectiveness, there's no theoretical framework explaining why these specific tasks are complementary.

**Open Question 3**: How does the proposed approach scale to scenarios with more than three modalities, and what challenges arise in maintaining effective modality balancing? The paper doesn't explore scenarios with more than three modalities, and it's unclear whether the current entropy weighting mechanism would remain effective as modality count increases.

## Limitations

- Incomplete architectural details regarding modality-specific and modality-shared feature split implementation and exact MLP architectures used for self-supervised tasks
- Class split methodology (designating first class alphabetically as unknown) may not generalize well to datasets with different class orderings or distributions
- No addressing of potential domain shift in unknown class distributions between source and target domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general methodology of using self-supervised pretext tasks for multimodal open-set domain generalization is sound and well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance improvements over baselines are credible, though exact reproduction may vary due to architectural ambiguities
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the first-class-as-unknown strategy to other datasets and the robustness of the approach to varying domain shift scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Implement and validate the entropy weighting mechanism independently to verify it properly balances modality contributions across different datasets
2. Conduct ablation studies removing each self-supervised task to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance
3. Test the approach on a different multimodal dataset with a different class split strategy to evaluate generalizability beyond the alphabetical unknown class designation
