# Exploring the Limitations of Large Language Models in Compositional Relation Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.02615
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02615
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GPT-4 achieves 67.2% accuracy on compositional relation tasks, while other models approach random guessing levels

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates large language models' capabilities in compositional relation reasoning across multiple languages. The authors construct a multilingual benchmark (MCR) with 1,500 test cases spanning six relation types and evaluate six state-of-the-art models including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Llama2 variants, and Mistral-7B. The study reveals significant limitations in LLMs' ability to handle complex multi-relation reasoning tasks, with most models performing near random guessing levels. Chain-of-thought prompting consistently improves performance across all models and languages, with English generally yielding the highest accuracy. The results highlight a substantial gap between LLMs' pattern recognition abilities and genuine understanding of compositional relations.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a multilingual benchmark (MCR) consisting of 1,500 test cases across six relation types: Positional, Comparative, Personal, Mathematical, Identity, and Other. The benchmark was translated into Chinese, Japanese, French, and Korean to assess multilingual performance. Six state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated: GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Mistral-7B. Experiments employed zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting and measured accuracy across different languages and relation types. The evaluation aimed to assess models' ability to reason compositionally rather than simply recognize patterns.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieved the highest accuracy at 67.2% with chain-of-thought prompting
- Most models struggled significantly, with some approaching random guessing levels
- Chain-of-thought prompting consistently improved performance across all models and languages
- English yielded the highest accuracy, with performance decreasing for other languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Chain-of-thought prompting enables LLMs to break down complex reasoning tasks into intermediate steps, allowing them to process compositional relations more effectively than direct answer approaches. This mechanism helps models navigate the hierarchical structure of multi-relation questions by creating explicit reasoning paths rather than attempting to derive answers in a single step.

## Foundational Learning
- **Compositional reasoning**: Understanding how multiple relations interact to form complex relationships - needed to assess models' ability to handle multi-step reasoning tasks - quick check: can the model correctly answer questions requiring two or more relational steps
- **Multilingual evaluation**: Testing model performance across different languages to identify language-specific reasoning capabilities - needed to determine if performance gaps are universal or language-dependent - quick check: compare accuracy drop across languages
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: A technique where models are prompted to show their reasoning process step-by-step - needed to improve performance on complex reasoning tasks - quick check: measure improvement from direct prompting to chain-of-thought

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Benchmark creation (MCR) -> Model evaluation (6 LLMs) -> Chain-of-thought prompting -> Multilingual testing
- **Critical path:** Test case generation and translation → Model prompting and execution → Accuracy measurement → Performance analysis across languages and relation types
- **Design tradeoffs:** Comprehensive multilingual evaluation vs. potential translation artifacts; broad relation type coverage vs. depth of individual relation testing
- **Failure signatures:** Random guessing performance on complex questions; significant accuracy drops for non-English languages; inability to handle multi-relation compositions
- **3 first experiments:** 1) Test single-relation vs multi-relation question performance to identify complexity thresholds; 2) Compare chain-of-thought with few-shot prompting strategies; 3) Evaluate native-language versions against translated versions to isolate translation effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark semantic diversity within relation types is unclear due to minimal test case examples
- Translation process details are not provided, raising concerns about translation artifacts
- Performance gap between GPT-4 and other models may reflect instruction-following rather than reasoning limitations
- Lack of statistical significance testing to validate performance differences

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GPT-4 outperforms other models on this benchmark
- **Medium confidence**: Chain-of-thought prompting generally improves performance
- **Low confidence**: General claims about LLMs' inability to reason compositionally

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate translation quality effects by back-translating and comparing with native-language test sets
2. Implement statistical significance testing across multiple runs and compare chain-of-thought prompting against other prompting strategies to verify claimed improvements
3. Create benchmark subsets with varying complexity levels (single-relation vs multi-relation questions) to determine whether performance degradation correlates with compositional depth
