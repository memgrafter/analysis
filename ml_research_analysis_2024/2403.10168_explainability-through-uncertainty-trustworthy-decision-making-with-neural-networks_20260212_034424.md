# Explainability through uncertainty: Trustworthy decision-making with neural networks

## Quick Facts

- This paper positions uncertainty estimation as a novel explainable AI technique, providing local, model-specific explanations for neural network predictions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework that positions uncertainty estimation as a novel explainable AI (XAI) technique for neural networks, providing local, model-specific explanations through decomposition of predictions into data and model uncertainty components. The framework integrates classification with rejection, allowing human experts to review uncertain predictions and thereby improving trustworthiness under distribution shifts. Applied to student performance prediction in educational data mining, the approach demonstrates that capturing model uncertainty through methods like Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles significantly improves accuracy retention under distribution shifts compared to standard neural networks.

## Method Summary
The framework combines neural network uncertainty estimation with classification with rejection to enable trustworthy decision-making. It uses either Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles to estimate uncertainty, then decomposes total uncertainty into aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) components. Predictions are made with rejection thresholds based on total uncertainty, where uncertain predictions are passed to human experts. The approach was evaluated on the HarvardX-MITx 2013 De-Identified dataset for student performance prediction, using three types of distribution shifts: same course-same year, same course-next year, and other course-next year.

## Key Results
- Under distribution shifts, model uncertainty grows while data uncertainty remains stable or decreases, signaling degraded performance
- The proposed approach achieves up to 95% accuracy by rejecting the most uncertain predictions
- Standard neural networks stagnate at initial accuracy levels when facing large distribution shifts, while uncertainty-aware methods maintain performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Uncertainty estimation functions as a local, model-specific XAI technique by decomposing predictions into data and model uncertainty. By quantifying both sources of uncertainty, the framework provides per-observation explanations that indicate whether errors stem from inherent data randomness or from model ignorance due to sparse training coverage.

### Mechanism 2
Classification with rejection improves trustworthiness by enabling human-in-the-loop decision making for uncertain predictions. Uncertainty estimates are used to filter out low-confidence predictions, passing them to human experts. This reduces misclassification rates while maintaining high accuracy on retained predictions.

### Mechanism 3
Under distribution shift, model uncertainty grows while data uncertainty remains stable or decreases, signaling degraded performance. When test data diverges from training distribution, model uncertainty captures unfamiliarity with new patterns, while data uncertainty reflects inherent randomness in overlapping class distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles:
  - Why needed here: These are the two uncertainty estimation techniques compared in the case study for neural networks
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between how MC Dropout and Deep Ensembles generate multiple predictions for uncertainty estimation?

- Uncertainty decomposition (aleatoric vs. epistemic):
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly decomposes total uncertainty into data and model components for XAI purposes
  - Quick check question: In the binary classification example, why does observation A have high model uncertainty while observation B has high data uncertainty?

- Classification with rejection metrics (NRA, CQ, RQ):
  - Why needed here: These metrics guide the decision maker in setting rejection thresholds to balance accuracy and human review costs
  - Quick check question: If classification quality (CQ) keeps increasing as more observations are rejected, what does this indicate about the uncertainty estimates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Neural Network (base model) → Uncertainty Estimator (MC Dropout or Deep Ensembles) → Uncertainty Decomposition → Classification with Rejection → Human-in-the-loop
- Critical path: Prediction → Uncertainty estimation → Rejection decision → (if rejected) Human review → Final output
- Design tradeoffs: Higher rejection rates improve accuracy but increase human review costs; simpler uncertainty methods (standard NN) are computationally cheaper but less informative under shifts
- Failure signatures: Stagnating non-rejected accuracy under large shifts, rapidly increasing classification quality suggesting random rejections, low rejection quality indicating poor separation of correct/incorrect predictions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train standard NN on MITx/6.00x/2012_Fall and evaluate accuracy on same course-same year test set
  2. Apply MC Dropout to same NN and compare uncertainty distributions across no/small/large shifts
  3. Implement classification with rejection using total uncertainty and plot NRA/CQ/RQ curves for all three methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of uncertainty estimation techniques vary across different types of distribution shifts (e.g., covariate shift vs. prior probability shift) in educational data mining?

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of model uncertainty on the overall performance of classification with rejection systems in high-stakes decision-making scenarios?

### Open Question 3
How can the framework be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks with a large number of classes, and what are the challenges associated with uncertainty estimation in such scenarios?

## Limitations

- The framework's applicability to domains beyond educational data mining remains to be demonstrated
- The decomposition of uncertainty into data and model components functioning as local XAI is insufficiently evidenced in the corpus
- Limited investigation of how different types of distribution shifts affect uncertainty estimation performance

## Confidence

- **High**: The empirical demonstration that uncertainty-aware models achieve higher non-rejected accuracy under distribution shifts
- **Medium**: The framework's general applicability to domains beyond educational data mining
- **Low**: The decomposition of uncertainty into data and model components functioning as a local XAI technique

## Next Checks

1. Apply the framework to a different domain (e.g., medical diagnosis or financial fraud detection) with known distribution shifts to test generalizability beyond educational data mining.

2. Conduct user studies where human experts review predictions rejected based on uncertainty estimates, measuring actual error reduction versus the theoretical accuracy improvements reported.

3. Implement and compare additional uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., evidential deep learning or deterministic uncertainty quantification) to assess whether the observed benefits are specific to MC Dropout and Deep Ensembles or represent a broader principle.
