# Noisy Spiking Actor Network for Exploration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04162
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04162
- Reference count: 14
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with APR of 116.63% vs deep actor networks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of effective exploration in spiking neural networks (SNNs) for deep reinforcement learning. The authors propose NoisySAN, which introduces time-correlated noise during the charging and transmission phases of spiking neurons, overcoming the inherent noise robustness of SNNs. A noise reduction method stabilizes the policy after sufficient exploration. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym demonstrate that NoisySAN achieves an average performance ratio of 116.63% compared to deep actor networks and 16.63% higher than the best spiking actor network.

## Method Summary
NoisySAN implements time-correlated noise in spiking neurons during charging (Eq. 9) and transmission (Eq. 6) phases, generating temporally coherent action sequences that align with SNN internal structure. A noise reduction method for non-spiking output neurons (Eq. 11) dynamically adjusts exploration-exploitation balance based on episode rewards (Eq. 12). The network architecture partitions into a backbone SNN with fixed noise parameters for continuous exploration and an output layer with learnable parameters and noise reduction for policy stabilization. The method is integrated into TD3 algorithms and evaluated on continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym.

## Key Results
- Average Performance Ratio (APR) of 116.63% compared to deep actor networks
- 16.63% higher performance than the best spiking actor network
- Effective exploration demonstrated through superior performance on Ant-v3, HalfCheetah-v3, Hopper-v3, Walker2d-v3, Humanoid-v3, HumanoidStandup-v2, InvertedDoublePendulum-v2, and BipedalWalker-v3 tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Time-correlated noise in the charging dynamics and spike transmission of spiking neurons provides a more effective exploration strategy than local perturbations. By injecting time-correlated noise during the charging and transmission phases, the network generates temporally coherent action sequences that align with the internal temporal structure of the SNN. This allows the agent to explore diverse state-action trajectories that require multi-step coordination. The temporal correlation (controlled by parameter β) is essential for enabling exploration behaviors that require consistency over multiple steps.

### Mechanism 2
The noise reduction method stabilizes the policy after sufficient exploration by reducing the noise variance of non-spiking neurons in the output layer. A loss term proportional to the noise variance of non-spiking neurons is added to the original loss function, dynamically weighted based on episode reward. This encourages exploration when rewards are low and exploitation when rewards are high, enabling the policy to converge to a stable solution without sacrificing exploration efficiency.

### Mechanism 3
Fixing the noise parameters of spiking neurons in the backbone SNN while making the noise parameters of non-spiking neurons learnable with noise reduction enables effective exploration and stable exploitation. Fixed noise parameters in the backbone ensure continuous and effective exploration throughout training, while learnable noise parameters with noise reduction in the output layer allow the policy to converge to a stable solution. The partitioning leverages the fact that noise has greater impact on actions for neurons closer to the output, while the robust binary firing mechanism of SNNs in the backbone makes the effect of small noise on actions less significant.

## Foundational Learning

- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Understanding the binary firing mechanism and the dynamics of spiking neurons is crucial for designing effective exploration strategies in SNNs. Quick check: How does the binary firing mechanism of spiking neurons contribute to their robustness to noise?

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**: Familiarity with DRL concepts like exploration-exploitation trade-off, policy optimization, and actor-critic methods is essential for implementing and training the NoisySAN. Quick check: What is the role of exploration in reinforcement learning, and how do methods like NoisyNet address this challenge?

- **Temporal Correlation in Noise**: Understanding the concept of colored noise and its temporal correlation is important for designing noise generation methods that align with the internal temporal structure of SNNs. Quick check: How does the parameter β control the temporal correlation of colored noise, and what are the implications for exploration in RL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Population encoder -> Backbone SNN (noisy CLIF neurons with fixed noise) -> Output layer (noisy integrated neurons with learnable noise and noise reduction) -> Population decoder -> Deep critic network (TD3)

- **Critical path**: 1) State input encoded into spike-trains by population encoder. 2) Spike-trains propagate through backbone SNN with fixed noise parameters. 3) Output spike-trains processed by output layer with learnable noise parameters and noise reduction. 4) Population decoder converts output spike-trains into continuous actions. 5) Actions evaluated by deep critic network using TD3 algorithms. 6) Loss computed and used to update NoisySAN and critic network.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed vs. learnable noise parameters balance continuous exploration with policy stabilization; temporal correlation of noise affects exploration efficiency; noise reduction method must be carefully tuned to avoid premature convergence.

- **Failure signatures**: Degraded exploration efficiency if noise parameters are too small or temporal correlation insufficient; unstable policy if noise reduction is too aggressive or improperly tuned; poor performance on specific tasks due to SNN architecture characteristics.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Verify impact of noise parameters on exploration efficiency by training with different noise levels and measuring APR. 2) Compare performance with and without noise reduction method to assess policy stability impact. 3) Evaluate effectiveness of different colored noise types (pink, red, white) by training with each and comparing APRs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the noise reduction method affect long-term exploration efficiency and policy stability in different environments? The paper proposes noise reduction for stabilizing policy after exploration but lacks comprehensive analysis across various environments regarding long-term exploration efficiency and policy stability.

- What is the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in NoisySAN, and how does it vary across different tasks? While the paper introduces noise reduction implying an optimal balance exists that varies by task, it does not provide detailed analysis of this balance across different tasks.

- How does the introduction of colored noise impact the exploration efficiency and performance of NoisySAN compared to other noise types? The paper provides experimental results comparing performance with different noise types but lacks detailed analysis of how colored noise specifically impacts exploration efficiency compared to other noise types.

## Limitations

- The claims about temporal correlation being essential for effective exploration rely on weak empirical evidence with limited ablation studies.
- The mechanism by which fixed noise parameters in the backbone SNN contribute to exploration is not well-explained.
- The partitioning of the network into fixed-noise and learnable-noise segments appears heuristic rather than theoretically grounded.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Claims about NoisySAN achieving superior APR compared to baselines are well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The noise reduction mechanism's effectiveness is demonstrated empirically but lacks theoretical grounding for why it stabilizes policies.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that temporal correlation is crucial for exploration in SNNs is not adequately validated through ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on temporal correlation**: Systematically vary the β parameter from 0 (white noise) to 1 (maximum temporal correlation) across all tasks to quantify the relationship between temporal correlation strength and exploration efficiency.

2. **Cross-layer noise sensitivity analysis**: Measure the gradient of action changes with respect to noise perturbations at different layers to empirically validate the claim that output-layer noise has greater impact on actions.

3. **Policy stability metrics**: Track additional metrics during training such as action variance, policy entropy, and learning curve smoothness to better characterize the stabilizing effect of the noise reduction method beyond final performance scores.
