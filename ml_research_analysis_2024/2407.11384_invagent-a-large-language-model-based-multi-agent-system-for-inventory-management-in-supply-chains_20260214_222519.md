# InvAgent: A Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System for Inventory Management in Supply Chains

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11384
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11384
- Authors: Yinzhu Quan; Zefang Liu
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: LLM-based multi-agent system achieves lower costs and better adaptability than heuristic policies in supply chain inventory management

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces InvAgent, a novel multi-agent inventory management system that leverages large language models (LLMs) for adaptive decision-making in supply chains. The system uses LLMs as zero-shot learners, enabling agents to make informed inventory decisions without prior training by interpreting supply chain states through Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Evaluated across various demand scenarios, InvAgent demonstrates competitive performance compared to traditional heuristic and reinforcement learning baselines, offering both improved cost efficiency and explainability.

## Method Summary
InvAgent employs a multi-agent architecture where each supply chain stage (retailer, wholesaler, distributor, manufacturer) is represented by an autonomous agent powered by an LLM. The system uses zero-shot learning, allowing agents to interpret current supply chain states and make inventory decisions based on their pre-existing knowledge without specific training data. Chain-of-Thought reasoning is incorporated to enhance decision quality and provide explainability. A user proxy coordinates communication between the environment and all stage agents, managing data flow and ensuring efficient coordination across the supply chain.

## Key Results
- InvAgent achieves lower total costs compared to heuristic policies (base-stock and tracking demand) across most demand scenarios
- The system demonstrates superior adaptability to variable and seasonal demand patterns compared to traditional approaches
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning provides enhanced explainability without significantly compromising decision quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can act as zero-shot learners in inventory management without prior training
- Mechanism: The LLM leverages its pre-existing knowledge and reasoning capabilities to interpret supply chain states and make informed decisions about inventory orders based on factors like inventory levels, backlogs, and lead times
- Core assumption: The LLM has sufficient pre-existing knowledge about inventory management concepts and can reason about supply chain dynamics without specific examples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our contributions include utilizing LLMs for zero-shot learning to enable adaptive and informed decision-making without prior training"
  - [section] "Our designed prompt operates on a zero-shot basis without providing any specific examples to the LLM"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Chain-of-Thought reasoning enhances explainability and decision quality
- Mechanism: Structured reasoning through Chain-of-Thought approach helps the model better understand scenarios, improve reasoning capabilities, and lead to more accurate outcomes
- Core assumption: Guiding the LLM through structured reasoning process improves its understanding and decision-making in inventory management
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our model offers significant explainability and clarity, enhanced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for reasoning"
  - [section] "By guiding the LLM through a structured reasoning process, CoT helps the model to better understand the scenario and improve its reasoning capabilities"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multi-agent system with user proxy enables efficient coordination across supply chain stages
- Mechanism: User proxy acts as intermediary facilitating communication and managing data exchange between environment and all supply chain agents
- Core assumption: User proxy effectively manages coordination and data flow between agents and environment
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The user proxy serves as an intermediary between the environment and all supply chain agents, facilitating communication and managing the exchange of data"
  - [section] "The framework of InvAgent method is illustrated in Figure 1, which follows these steps: 1. The user proxy resets the environment... 2. The user proxy requests the state... 3. The user proxy provides the state to each stage..."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Supply chain management and inventory optimization
  - Why needed here: Understanding core concepts of supply chain management, including inventory control, demand forecasting, and lead times, is crucial for effectively using LLM-based system
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a multi-echelon supply chain inventory management system, and how do they interact?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: Zero-shot learning allows LLM to make decisions without prior training on specific examples, while Chain-of-Thought reasoning enhances model's understanding and decision quality
  - Quick check question: How does zero-shot learning differ from traditional machine learning approaches, and what are the benefits of using Chain-of-Thought reasoning in decision-making?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning and heuristic baselines
  - Why needed here: Understanding basics of reinforcement learning and heuristic baselines provides context for evaluating performance of LLM-based system
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between reinforcement learning and heuristic baselines in inventory management, and how do they compare in terms of performance and adaptability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  User Proxy -> Stage Agents (Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, Manufacturer) -> Environment

- Critical path:
  1. User proxy resets the environment at beginning of each round
  2. User proxy requests state of current round for each stage from environment
  3. User proxy provides state to each stage and requests action from it
  4. User proxy sends agent actions to environment and obtains next state and reward
  5. User proxy determines whether simulation is terminated; if not, simulation moves to step 2

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot learning vs. fine-tuning: Zero-shot learning allows quick deployment without training data but may have lower performance compared to fine-tuned models
  - Chain-of-Thought reasoning vs. direct action generation: Chain-of-Thought enhances explainability and decision quality but adds complexity to prompt design
  - Multi-agent system vs. centralized control: Multi-agent system allows distributed decision-making but introduces coordination challenges

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor inventory decisions leading to excessive stockouts or overstocking
  - Lack of coordination between stages resulting in bullwhip effect or other supply chain inefficiencies
  - User proxy failing to provide accurate or timely information to agents
  - LLM generating nonsensical or irrelevant responses to prompts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test system with simple constant demand scenario to verify basic functionality and coordination between stages
  2. Evaluate system's performance with variable demand scenario to assess adaptability to changing conditions
  3. Compare LLM-based system against heuristic baselines (base-stock policy) to benchmark effectiveness in inventory management

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Zero-shot learning approach relies heavily on LLM's pre-existing knowledge, which may vary significantly across different model versions and providers
- Evaluation focuses primarily on simulation environments, leaving open questions about real-world applicability and robustness to unexpected scenarios
- Comparison with heuristic baselines doesn't fully account for computational overhead and latency of LLM-based decision-making in production environments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of using LLMs as zero-shot learners for inventory decisions is technically sound and well-supported by results across multiple demand scenarios
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority of InvAgent over heuristic baselines is demonstrated, but performance gap may narrow in simpler or more stable demand environments
- **Medium confidence**: Explainability benefits of Chain-of-Thought reasoning are plausible based on methodology, but direct user studies or expert evaluations would strengthen this claim

## Next Checks
1. Test InvAgent's performance across different LLM providers (e.g., Claude, Gemini) and versions to assess consistency and identify potential model-specific biases or limitations
2. Implement a small-scale pilot deployment in an actual supply chain setting to evaluate performance against simulation results and identify practical challenges not captured in controlled environment
3. Measure and compare inference time and cost per decision between LLM-based agents and traditional heuristic approaches across varying scales of supply chain complexity
