# SCORE: A 1D Reparameterization Technique to Break Bayesian Optimization's Curse of Dimensionality

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2406.12661
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12661
- **Authors:** Joseph Chakar
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Finds global minimum of 200D Ackley function in minutes with <500 evaluations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SCORE, a novel approach to address the curse of dimensionality in Bayesian optimization by decomposing high-dimensional search spaces into individual 1D parameter spaces. Instead of performing expensive Gaussian Process regression on the full D-dimensional space (which scales cubically with dimension), SCORE maintains computational complexity linear with dimension by performing GP regression separately on each parameter. The method demonstrates remarkable efficiency, finding the global minimum of a 200D Ackley function in minutes with fewer than 500 evaluations - a task that typically requires thousands of iterations on supercomputers. SCORE also achieves excellent performance on real-world solar panel data fitting, requiring fewer than 10 function evaluations.

## Method Summary
SCORE works by reparameterizing the D-dimensional search space into D individual 1D spaces, one for each parameter. The algorithm performs Gaussian Process regression on each 1D parameter space separately while tracking the minimum objective function values. This decomposition reduces computational complexity from O(n³D) to O(n³D) where n is the number of samples, but crucially avoids the cubic scaling in D by keeping each regression 1-dimensional. The method evaluates multiple parameter combinations simultaneously per iteration, further accelerating the search process. After GP regression on each parameter, SCORE identifies the most promising parameter combinations and evaluates them, maintaining the uncertainty quantification benefits of Gaussian Processes while dramatically reducing computational burden.

## Key Results
- Solved 200D Ackley function in minutes with <500 evaluations, compared to thousands of iterations required by state-of-the-art methods
- Fitted experimental solar panel current-voltage data in under 10 function evaluations and a fraction of standard BO's time
- Maintained reliable uncertainty estimation while achieving linear (rather than cubic) computational complexity scaling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SCORE breaks the curse of dimensionality by exploiting the observation that high-dimensional optimization problems can often be decomposed into lower-dimensional subproblems. By treating each parameter independently in 1D spaces, the method avoids the exponential growth in computational complexity that plagues standard Bayesian optimization. The simultaneous evaluation of multiple parameter combinations leverages parallelization opportunities while the GP-based uncertainty quantification ensures exploration-exploitation balance. The approach is particularly effective for problems where the objective function has some separability or where global optimization can benefit from systematic exploration of individual parameter spaces.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Optimization:** Sequential optimization framework using surrogate models - needed to understand the baseline approach being improved; quick check: can you explain expected improvement acquisition function?
- **Gaussian Process Regression:** Probabilistic surrogate modeling technique - needed to understand SCORE's core regression approach; quick check: can you derive GP prediction equations?
- **Curse of Dimensionality:** Exponential growth in complexity with dimensions - needed to appreciate why standard BO fails in high dimensions; quick check: can you explain why GP complexity scales as O(n³D)?
- **Parameter Decomposition:** Breaking high-dimensional problems into lower-dimensional subproblems - needed to understand SCORE's fundamental insight; quick check: can you identify problems where this decomposition might fail?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input function → Parameter decomposition → 1D GP regressions → Score aggregation → Parameter combination evaluation → Next iteration
**Critical Path:** The core algorithm loop: decompose → regress → aggregate scores → evaluate combinations → update
**Design Tradeoffs:** SCORE trades off the ability to capture parameter interactions (present in full-dimensional GP) for dramatic computational efficiency gains
**Failure Signatures:** Getting trapped in local minima, excessive computational time from poor mesh resolution choices, failure to converge on highly correlated parameter spaces
**First Experiments:** 1) Implement basic 1D GP regression on synthetic functions, 2) Add parameter decomposition and score aggregation, 3) Test on 10D Ackley function with comparison to standard BO

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does SCORE's performance scale with extremely high-dimensional spaces (e.g., 1000+ dimensions) compared to state-of-the-art BO methods? The paper demonstrates effectiveness on 200D but doesn't test beyond this.
- Can SCORE's convergence speed be further improved by tailoring surrogate models and acquisition functions to individual parameters? The authors suggest this but provide no empirical validation.
- How does SCORE handle optimization problems with non-separable parameters where the objective function cannot be decomposed into independent 1D projections? The approach implicitly assumes some parameter independence.

## Limitations
- Lacks detailed implementation specifics for the SCORE algorithm, particularly how individual parameter scores are aggregated
- No source code provided, making exact reproduction difficult without significant engineering effort
- Limited testing on problems with known parameter correlations or non-separable objective functions

## Confidence
- **Core claim (SCORE addresses curse of dimensionality):** Medium - conceptually sound and results appear compelling but exact implementation cannot be verified
- **Specific performance metrics:** Low - impressive results reported but lack independent verification
- **Generalizability across problem types:** Low-Medium - demonstrated on limited benchmark set without testing on highly correlated parameter spaces

## Next Checks
1. Implement a minimal version of SCORE focusing on the 1D parameter decomposition and GP regression, then systematically compare convergence rates on the 10D Ackley function against standard BO with identical initialization
2. Contact the authors directly to obtain source code or detailed algorithmic pseudocode, particularly for the parameter combination evaluation and scoring mechanism
3. Test SCORE's performance on additional high-dimensional benchmark functions beyond Ackley to assess generalizability and robustness across different problem landscapes
