## Executive Summary
This study introduces the Cosine Convolutional Neural Network (CosCovNN) for raw audio classification, replacing traditional CNN filters with cosine filters inspired by the Discrete Cosine Transform and Fourier analysis. The proposed model significantly reduces parameters by approximately 77% while maintaining or improving classification accuracy compared to standard CNNs. To further enhance performance, the Vector Quantised Cosine Convolutional Neural Network with Memory (VQCCM) is developed, incorporating vector quantisation and memory mechanisms. VQCCM achieves state-of-the-art results across five diverse audio datasets, including speech emotion, speaker identification, acoustic scenes, musical instrument classification, and spoken digit recognition. The findings demonstrate that cosine filters effectively capture audio patterns and improve computational efficiency, while the integration of VQ and memory layers substantially boosts performance.

## Method Summary
The research proposes a novel raw audio classification approach using Cosine Convolutional Neural Networks (CosCovNN) that replace traditional CNN filters with cosine-based filters requiring only two learnable parameters per filter. The architecture is further enhanced with a Vector Quantised Cosine Convolutional Neural Network with Memory (VQCCM) that integrates vector quantization for feature compression and memory layers for information persistence across network layers. The model is trained on five diverse audio datasets (Speech Command, Spoken Digit, Speech Emotion, Acoustic Scenes, Musical Instrument, and Speaker Identification) at 16 kHz sampling rate with 1-second duration clips. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing model parameters by approximately 77% compared to equivalent CNN architectures.

## Key Results
- CosCovNN reduces parameters by approximately 77% compared to traditional CNN architectures while maintaining or improving classification accuracy
- VQCCM achieves state-of-the-art results across five diverse audio classification datasets
- The combination of cosine filters, vector quantization, and memory mechanisms significantly enhances raw audio classification performance
- Memory layer integration improves performance but requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cosine filters in CosCovNN reduce parameter count by ~77% while maintaining or improving accuracy.
- Mechanism: Cosine filters use a periodic function with only two learnable parameters (amplitude and frequency) instead of L parameters per filter, dramatically reducing model size while still capturing essential frequency information from audio signals.
- Core assumption: The periodic nature of cosine functions adequately represents the frequency characteristics of audio signals, allowing fewer parameters to capture the same or better information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "replaces the traditional CNN filters with Cosine filters. The CosCovNN surpasses the accuracy of the equivalent CNN architectures with approximately 77% less parameters."
  - [section]: "A CosCovNN only requires learning two parameters for a filter of the same size L. Thus, for any given filter, the CosCovNN effectively reduces the number of parameters by L − 2, where L > 2, relative to the CNN architecture."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for cosine filters specifically, but similar parameter-efficient approaches exist in the literature.
- Break condition: If audio signals contain non-periodic or highly irregular patterns that cannot be adequately represented by cosine functions, the reduced parameter count may lead to information loss and degraded performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vector Quantization (VQ) layer forces the model to extract and focus on significant features from the audio waveform.
- Mechanism: The VQ layer replaces incoming features with the nearest embedding from a learned codebook, effectively compressing information into discrete representations that highlight the most important patterns.
- Core assumption: The nearest-neighbor replacement in VQ layer preserves the most salient information while discarding noise or redundant features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The idea behind vector quantisation (V Q) is to represent n set of vectors, V ∈ { v1, v2, . . . vn} by a finite set of m representative vectors from a codebook, C ∈ {c1, c2, . . . cm}."
  - [section]: "During the forward pass, the audio is passed through the Cosine Convolutional Neural Network (CosCovNN) and max-pooling layer, yielding a feature representation... Specifically, for each batch and channel, the Euclidean Distance between the feature, Fi, where i ∈ { 1, 2, . . . b × c} and the embedding vectors Ej, where j ∈ { 1, 2, . . . k} from the codebook E, is computed."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for VQ in audio classification, though VQ has been used in other domains like VQ-VAE.
- Break condition: If the codebook size is too small, important information may be lost; if too large, the VQ layer may not effectively compress or may overfit to training data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Memory layers enable effective information flow from early layers to later stages, improving raw audio modeling performance.
- Mechanism: Memory writers capture intermediate representations from each layer and store them in a memory vector, while memory readers retrieve this information and combine it with current layer features, creating a pathway for important information to persist through the network.
- Core assumption: Information captured in early layers contains valuable features that, if preserved and properly combined with later layer features, can improve overall classification performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "a memory module allows important information captured by the initial layers to be effectively retained and passed through to later stages, improving raw audio modelling performance."
  - [section]: "The memory layer is composed of three key components: Memory (M EM), Memory Writer (M W), and Reader ( M R). The Memory vector M EM is a vector with dimensions R1×M, where M represents the size of the Memory vector."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence, though memory-augmented neural networks have shown success in other domains.
- Break condition: If memory size is improperly tuned (too small or too large), the system may either lose important information or overfit to training data, respectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
  - Why needed here: The cosine filters in CosCovNN are inspired by DCT principles, which represent signals through summation of cosine functions at varying frequencies, making this knowledge essential for understanding why cosine filters work for audio.
  - Quick check question: How does the DCT represent a signal differently from the Fourier Transform, and why is this representation particularly suited for audio signals?

- Concept: Vector Quantization principles
  - Why needed here: The VQ layer in VQCCM uses vector quantization to compress feature representations, so understanding how VQ works and its trade-offs is crucial for implementing and tuning this component.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical objective of vector quantization, and how does the Euclidean distance calculation determine which codebook vector to use for replacement?

- Concept: Memory-augmented neural networks
  - Why needed here: The memory layer in VQCCM follows principles from memory-augmented neural networks, where information persistence across layers is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies in audio signals.
  - Quick check question: How do memory writers and readers interact in a memory-augmented neural network, and what role does the memory vector play in preserving information across layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw waveform → Cosine Conv Layer → Max Pool → VQ Layer → Memory Writer → Memory Reader → Subsequent Cosine Conv Layers → Global Average Pooling → Class-specific Cosine Conv Layers → Output

- Critical path: Raw waveform → Cosine Conv Layer → Max Pool → VQ Layer → Memory Writer → Memory Reader → Subsequent Cosine Conv Layers → Global Average Pooling → Class-specific Cosine Conv Layers → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Cosine filters vs. traditional filters: Fewer parameters (77% reduction) but may miss non-periodic patterns
  - VQ layer placement: Must be after first convolutional layer to capture initial feature extraction
  - Memory size: Tradeoff between information retention and computational overhead
  - Codebook size in VQ: Larger codebooks capture more information but increase complexity and risk overfitting

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on non-periodic audio patterns: Indicates cosine filters may be inadequate for certain signal types
  - Degradation when increasing memory size: Suggests overfitting or improper memory integration
  - Inconsistent improvements with VQ layer: May indicate codebook size or VQ implementation issues
  - Memory layer causing instability: Could indicate improper memory update mechanisms or dimension mismatches

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace traditional CNN filters with cosine filters in a simple architecture and compare parameter count and accuracy on a small audio dataset
  2. Add a VQ layer after the first convolutional layer and test different codebook sizes to find optimal compression without information loss
  3. Integrate memory layers into the architecture and experiment with different memory sizes to identify the point of diminishing returns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do cosine filters in CosCovNN generalize across different audio domains beyond the five tested datasets (speech emotion, speaker identification, acoustic scenes, musical instrument classification, and spoken digit recognition)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their findings are based on only five datasets, presenting a limitation, and suggest future work could explore applications in other domains such as speaker diarization, speech-to-text conversion, music mood identification, and audio event classification.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates CosCovNN on five specific datasets and does not test its performance across a broader range of audio domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive testing of CosCovNN on diverse audio datasets representing various domains would demonstrate its generalization capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between memory size and VQ embedding size in VQCCM for different audio classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conducted experiments to identify appropriate memory sizes and VQ embedding numbers, finding that performance can be significantly enhanced by integrating memory, but excessive increase in memory size can lead to overfitting, and using too few embeddings can result in underfitting.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to specific datasets (S09 and IEMOCAP), and the optimal configuration may vary across different audio classification tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation across multiple diverse audio datasets with varying memory and VQ embedding sizes would identify optimal configurations for different tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of VQCCM compare to state-of-the-art transformer-based models for audio classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest future research could explore integration with advanced machine learning techniques like transformers, indicating that this comparison has not been made.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare VQCCM to transformer-based models, which have shown strong performance in various audio classification tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of VQCCM with transformer-based models on the same datasets would reveal relative performance and potential areas for improvement.

## Limitations

- The study lacks specific implementation details for critical components including exact training hyperparameters, VQ codebook size optimization procedures, and memory layer tuning methodology
- The claim of "state-of-the-art results" requires verification against published benchmarks, which are not cited in the abstract
- Limited testing across diverse audio domains - the model is only evaluated on five specific datasets, leaving generalization to other audio tasks uncertain

## Confidence

- High confidence in the parameter reduction claim (77% fewer parameters) and its mathematical foundation, as this follows directly from the cosine filter parameterization with only 2 learnable parameters per filter
- Medium confidence in the accuracy improvements across all datasets, as specific performance metrics are not provided in the abstract and would need validation
- Low confidence in the VQCCM architecture's superiority without seeing detailed ablation studies showing the individual contributions of VQ and memory layers

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the parameter count calculation for a standard CNN vs. CosCovNN with identical filter sizes to verify the 77% reduction claim
2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing CosCovNN performance on datasets where cosine filters should excel (periodic signals) versus those where they might struggle (non-periodic noise)
3. Perform ablation studies on the VQCCM architecture to quantify the individual contributions of vector quantization and memory layers to overall performance improvements
