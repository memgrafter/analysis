# MultiMed: Massively Multimodal and Multitask Medical Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12682
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12682
- Reference count: 40
- MultiMed is a large-scale benchmark for multimodal and multitask learning in medicine, featuring 2.56M samples across 10 modalities and 11 tasks, showing that multimodal multitask learning achieves the best performance (69.38% on medical VQA vs. 49.35% unimodal).

## Executive Summary
MultiMed is a comprehensive benchmark for advancing medical AI through multimodal and multitask learning. The benchmark encompasses 2.56 million samples across 10 different modalities including text, imaging, EEG, and genomics, covering 11 distinct medical tasks from disease classification to protein structure prediction. The authors demonstrate that combining multiple modalities and tasks simultaneously yields superior performance compared to unimodal or singletask approaches, with a 20-point improvement on medical VQA tasks. The benchmark is publicly available and designed to enable research in out-of-distribution generalization, transfer learning, and novel modality combinations.

## Method Summary
The MultiMed benchmark systematically integrates diverse medical data sources across multiple modalities and tasks into a unified framework. The authors collected and curated 2.56 million samples spanning text reports, medical images, genomic sequences, EEG signals, and other biomedical data types. They designed standardized evaluation protocols for 11 medical tasks including disease classification, tumor detection, and protein structure prediction. The benchmark framework allows for systematic evaluation of unimodal, multimodal, and multitask learning approaches, with careful attention to dataset distribution and potential biases. The authors implemented baseline models for each learning paradigm and conducted extensive experiments to establish performance baselines across different modality combinations and task configurations.

## Key Results
- Multimodal multitask learning achieves 69.38% accuracy on medical VQA tasks compared to 49.35% for unimodal approaches
- The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of out-of-distribution generalization across medical domains
- Performance improvements are consistent across multiple task types, demonstrating the general utility of multimodal learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of MultiMed stems from the complementary information provided by different medical modalities. Medical conditions often manifest across multiple data types - a neurological disorder might appear in EEG patterns, imaging results, and textual clinical notes simultaneously. By learning joint representations across modalities, models can capture richer, more robust features that single modalities might miss. The multitask learning aspect allows models to leverage shared knowledge across related medical tasks, improving generalization and reducing sample complexity for individual tasks. The large-scale
