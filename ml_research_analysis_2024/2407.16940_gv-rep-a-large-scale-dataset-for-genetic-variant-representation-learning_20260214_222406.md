- Introduces GV-Rep dataset with 7.5 million genetic variant records for genomic foundation model evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GV-Rep, a large-scale dataset for genetic variant representation learning designed to address limitations in existing genomic datasets. The dataset contains 7.5 million genetic variant records with diverse annotations, including pathogenicity, gene expression effects, and cell fitness impacts across multiple biological contexts. The authors constructed the dataset by integrating seven major genomic databases and adding 155 clinically verified variants from real patients. They conducted comprehensive analysis of the dataset's properties and performed experiments with four state-of-the-art genomic foundation models (GFMs) including HyenaDNA, DNABERT2, and two versions of Nucleotide Transformer. The results showed that while GFMs achieved 65-74% AUROC in pathogenicity classification, their performance dropped significantly in more challenging tasks like predicting cell-specific gene regulation and splicing effects. The study demonstrates that current GFMs have substantial gaps in accurately representing genetic variants, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The GV-Rep dataset was constructed by integrating seven major genomic databases (ClinVar, ClinGen, ClinVitae, UniProt, gnomAD, UniClone, and the GWAS catalog) and adding 155 clinician-verified variants from real patients. The dataset contains 7.5 million genetic variant records with diverse annotations including pathogenicity classifications, gene expression effects, cell fitness impacts, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), and multiplex assays of variant effect. The authors evaluated four pre-trained genomic foundation models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT2, and Nucleotide Transformer v1/v2) using a standardized fine-tuning approach with 3-layer CNN headers and Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-3). Model performance was assessed on multiple tasks including ClinVar pathogenicity classification, sQTL significance classification, and Gene-KO fitness score prediction using AUROC and MSE metrics.

## Key Results
- Genomic foundation models achieved 65-74% AUROC for pathogenicity classification but struggled with more complex tasks
- Performance dropped significantly on cell-specific gene regulation tasks, with sQTL classification AUROC around 52-54%
- All three tested models converged to similar MSE (~1.06) on Gene-KO fitness prediction task, suggesting potential model capacity limitations
- Clinical variant indexing accuracy varied significantly across different biological contexts and task complexities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset works by providing a comprehensive, multi-annotated collection of genetic variants that captures diverse biological contexts and functional impacts. By integrating multiple databases with different focus areas (pathogenicity, gene expression, cell fitness, etc.), the dataset enables evaluation of genomic foundation models across a spectrum of biological complexity. The inclusion of clinician-verified variants adds real-world validation to the synthetic data. The standardized fine-tuning approach with CNN headers allows fair comparison across different foundation model architectures while maintaining consistency in how variant representations are extracted and evaluated.

## Foundational Learning

**Genomic Foundation Models**: Deep learning models pre-trained on large-scale genomic sequences that learn general representations of DNA patterns and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
*Why needed*: Enable transfer learning from vast unlabeled genomic data to specific genetic variant analysis tasks with limited labeled examples.
*Quick check*: Verify that models were pre-trained on appropriate genomic data and retain learned representations after fine-tuning.

**Genetic Variant Representation Learning**: The process of encoding genetic variants (substitutions, insertions, deletions) into numerical representations that capture their biological significance and functional impacts.
*Why needed*: Allows machine learning models to process and reason about genetic variants as continuous vectors rather than discrete sequence changes.
*Quick check*: Confirm that variant representations capture both local sequence context and broader functional annotations.

**Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs)**: Genetic variants that explain variation in gene expression levels across individuals or cell types.
*Why needed*: Provide direct link between genetic variation and transcriptional regulation, essential for understanding variant functional impacts.
*Quick check*: Validate that eQTL associations are tissue-specific and capture regulatory element variants.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: GV-Rep dataset -> GFMs (HyenaDNA, DNABERT2, NT v1/v2) -> 3-layer CNN header -> Task-specific output layer

**Critical path**: Variant sequence extraction -> GFM encoding -> CNN feature extraction -> Classification/Regression output

**Design tradeoffs**: The standardized 3-layer CNN header provides fair comparison across GFMs but may limit the ability to leverage each model's unique architectural strengths. Longer context lengths improve performance but increase computational cost and memory requirements.

**Failure signatures**: Convergence to identical MSE values across models suggests optimization plateaus or insufficient model capacity for the task. Poor performance on tissue-specific tasks indicates models may not capture cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms effectively.

**First experiments**:
1. Fine-tune each GFM on ClinVar pathogenicity classification with varying context lengths (512, 1024, 2048 bp)
2. Compare model performance on eQTL prediction across different tissue types
3. Evaluate clinical variant indexing accuracy for the 155 clinician-verified variants

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How do longer genetic contexts (beyond 1024 base pairs) affect the performance of genomic foundation models in genetic variant representation learning?
The paper shows that accuracy drops with reduced context length in their lung disease classification task, and suggests that longer contexts should facilitate better prediction by modeling long-range interactions. The paper only tested context lengths up to 1024 base pairs, leaving open the question of whether even longer contexts would continue to improve performance or if there's a point of diminishing returns. Experimental results showing model performance across a wider range of context lengths (e.g., 1024-4096 base pairs) for multiple GV tasks, including both classification and regression tasks, would resolve this question.

**Open Question 2**: How does incorporating epigenetic data (such as DNA methylation patterns) into genetic variant representation learning affect model performance?
The paper's limitations section suggests that integrating epigenetic data could deepen understanding of how these factors influence gene expression and phenotypic manifestations of genetic variants. The GV-Rep dataset does not currently include epigenetic annotations, and the paper does not provide any experimental results incorporating such data. Experimental results comparing model performance on GV tasks with and without epigenetic features, ideally using a dataset that includes both genetic variant and epigenetic annotations, would resolve this question.

**Open Question 3**: How do different fine-tuning approaches affect the accuracy and adaptability of genomic foundation models for genetic variant representation learning?
The paper mentions that future research should explore diverse fine-tuning approaches to enhance model accuracy and adaptability. The paper only presents results from a standard three-layer CNN header approach for fine-tuning, without exploring alternative fine-tuning strategies. Comparative experimental results showing model performance across different fine-tuning methods (e.g., adapter-based fine-tuning, prompt tuning, full fine-tuning) for multiple GV tasks in the GV-Rep dataset would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Dataset integration process and variant coordinate mapping methods are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Observation that all three models reached the same MSE value (~1.06) on Gene-KO fitness prediction suggests potential optimization plateaus rather than true performance convergence
- Poor performance on cell-specific regulatory tasks (sQTL AUROC ~52-54%) may reflect insufficient context length for capturing tissue-specific regulatory elements

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Dataset construction methodology, basic dataset statistics, and overall experimental framework
**Medium confidence**: Model performance comparisons across different tasks, though absolute values may be affected by unspecified implementation details
**Low confidence**: Interpretation of failure modes, particularly the Gene-KO task convergence and sQTL task performance

## Next Checks
1. Verify exact sequence extraction parameters and coordinate mapping methodology used to generate variant-centered sequences
2. Test alternative context lengths for sQTL tasks to determine if performance improves with longer flanking sequences
3. Investigate whether the Gene-KO task MSE plateau reflects model capacity limitations by testing with larger model architectures or alternative loss functions
