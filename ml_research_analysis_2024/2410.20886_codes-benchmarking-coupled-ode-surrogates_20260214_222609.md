core_contribution: CODES is a benchmark for evaluating surrogate models designed to
  replace numerical solvers for coupled ODE systems. It addresses the lack of comprehensive,
  fair comparisons across different surrogate architectures by providing standardized
  metrics like MSE, MAE, and inference time, along with insights into interpolation,
  extrapolation, sparse data handling, uncertainty quantification, and gradient correlation.

# CODES: Benchmarking Coupled ODE Surrogates

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.20886
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20886
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** Benchmark suite for comparing surrogate models for coupled ODE systems with standardized metrics

## Executive Summary
CODES provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating surrogate models designed to replace numerical solvers for coupled ODE systems. The benchmark addresses the lack of standardized comparisons across different surrogate architectures by implementing four models (FCNN, MON, LNODE, LP) across five datasets (osu2008, branca24, lotka_volterra, simple_ode, simple_reaction). With standardized metrics including MSE, MAE, MRE, inference time, and gradient correlation, CODES enables researchers to select optimal models for specific tasks while providing insights into model behaviors like uncertainty quantification and sparse data handling.

## Method Summary
The benchmark implements four surrogate architectures - FCNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network), MON (Mixed-Order Network), LNODE (Latent Neural ODE), and LP (Latent Predictor) - trained and evaluated on five ODE datasets using standardized metrics. Models are trained on NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPUs with parallel processing across devices, and reproducibility is ensured through seed=42 settings. The framework includes web-based configuration generation, automatic dataset downloading, and comprehensive evaluation metrics covering accuracy, speed, and uncertainty quantification. Training and inference times are measured across different hardware configurations to provide performance insights.

## Key Results
- MON achieved the lowest MSE (5.89e-5) and MRE (0.49%) among all tested surrogate architectures
- LP demonstrated the fastest inference time at 0.55 ms per prediction
- LNODE showed the strongest correlation between data gradients and prediction errors (PCC 0.5006)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its standardized evaluation framework that eliminates variability in training procedures, hardware configurations, and metric calculations across different studies. By providing pre-implemented models and datasets with controlled hyperparameters and reproducible settings, CODES ensures fair comparisons between surrogate architectures. The comprehensive metric suite captures multiple dimensions of model performance including accuracy, speed, uncertainty quantification, and gradient behavior, enabling researchers to make informed decisions based on their specific application requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Surrogate modeling concepts**: Understanding how neural networks approximate ODE solutions is crucial for interpreting benchmark results and selecting appropriate models for different types of systems.
- **Standard evaluation metrics**: Familiarity with MSE, MAE, MRE, and inference time measurements is necessary for comparing model performance across different architectures and datasets.
- **Uncertainty quantification in neural networks**: Knowledge of methods like Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble approaches is needed to understand and evaluate the uncertainty metrics used in the benchmark.
- **Gradient correlation analysis**: Understanding how prediction errors relate to data gradients helps in interpreting model behavior and identifying failure modes in surrogate predictions.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
- Web-based config generator -> Config.yaml -> Training pipeline -> Evaluation pipeline -> Results aggregation

### Critical Path
1. Configuration generation via web interface
2. Model training with parallel processing
3. Evaluation across standardized metrics
4. Results aggregation and comparison

### Design Tradeoffs
The benchmark prioritizes reproducibility and standardization over flexibility, using fixed hyperparameters and controlled training conditions to ensure fair comparisons. This approach sacrifices the ability to explore optimal configurations for each model-dataset pair but enables direct performance comparisons. The choice of synthetic datasets provides controlled testing conditions but may limit real-world applicability.

### Failure Signatures
- Inconsistent results across runs indicate issues with seed settings or hardware configurations
- Training instability suggests suboptimal hyperparameters for specific dataset-model combinations
- Poor uncertainty quantification may indicate inadequate model capacity or inappropriate uncertainty estimation methods

### First Experiments
1. Run benchmark with default configuration to verify basic functionality
2. Compare inference times across different hardware configurations
3. Analyze gradient correlation results to identify models with strong error-prediction relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability due to evaluation on only four surrogate architectures and five datasets
- Performance results may not translate to real-world, noisy, or high-dimensional ODE systems
- Benchmark focuses on synthetic datasets rather than practical applications
- Hardware-specific performance measurements may not represent behavior on different configurations

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Benchmark framework design and implementation
- Standardized metrics and evaluation procedures
- Basic functionality (parallel training, reproducibility)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Comparative performance results across surrogate architectures
- Inference time measurements on tested hardware

**Low Confidence:**
- Uncertainty quantification behaviors
- Gradient correlation analysis generalizability

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce benchmark results on alternative GPU architectures and CPU-only configurations
2. Extend benchmark with additional surrogate architectures and real-world ODE systems
3. Conduct systematic hyperparameter tuning experiments across all model-dataset combinations
