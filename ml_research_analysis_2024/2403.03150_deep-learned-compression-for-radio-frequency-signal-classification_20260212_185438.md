# Deep-Learned Compression for Radio-Frequency Signal Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03150
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03150
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: HQARF achieves up to 20:1 compression while maintaining >80% classification accuracy on 6 modulation classes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HQARF, a deep learned compression model for radio-frequency (RF) signals using hierarchical vector-quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). The model compresses complex-valued RF samples from 6 modulation classes while preserving sufficient information for machine learning-based classification. HQARF uses a three-stage training approach combining reconstruction, quantization, and generative losses to achieve significant compression ratios while maintaining high classification accuracy.

## Method Summary
HQARF uses a hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture with multiple stacked layers, each progressively compressing the RF signal. The model is trained in three stages: first training hierarchical autoencoders (HAE) with reconstruction loss, then transfer-learning to a VQ-VAE structure with quantization and commitment losses, and finally adding generative loss (KL divergence) for the final model. The architecture allows adaptive compression at different rates (L0 to L4) without retraining separate models, and uses complex-valued RF samples converted to 2D real-valued format for processing.

## Key Results
- Achieves compression ratios up to 20:1 while maintaining classification accuracy above 80% for most compression levels
- Single model supports multiple compression rates (L0-L4) through hierarchical architecture
- Outperforms traditional compression methods like SVD-based thresholding for RF signal classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Vector quantization preserves classification accuracy by mapping high-dimensional RF signals to discrete codewords that capture dominant spectral and temporal patterns.
- Mechanism: The HQARF encoder projects complex-valued RF samples into a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized to a finite codebook. During reconstruction, the decoder inverts this process, producing an approximation of the original signal. Because the quantization clusters similar signal structures, the classification model can still recognize modulation types even with information loss.
- Core assumption: The learned codebook captures the most salient features for modulation classification rather than fine-grained waveform details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "HQARF uses a hierarchical architecture of VQ-VAEs to progressively compress the RF data."
  - [section]: "The hierarchical nature of HQARF allows us to use the same compression model adaptively for different compression rates."
- Break condition: If the codebook size is too small or poorly trained, critical distinguishing features between modulation classes are lost, causing classification accuracy to drop below acceptable thresholds.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical compression improves efficiency by allowing variable compression rates without retraining separate models.
- Mechanism: The HQARF architecture stacks multiple VQ-VAE layers; each layer further compresses the latent representation from the previous layer. This means a single model can produce outputs at multiple compression levels (L0 to L4), matching different bandwidth constraints or storage limits.
- Core assumption: Intermediate latent representations retain sufficient information for classification, even when further compressed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model is trained using a combination of reconstruction loss, quantization loss, and generative loss."
  - [section]: "The hierarchical nature of HQARF allows us to use the same compression model adaptively for different compression rates."
- Break condition: If any layer's quantization excessively degrades the latent representation, subsequent layers cannot recover meaningful signal characteristics, collapsing classification performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training with generative loss (KL divergence) improves reconstruction fidelity by enforcing a prior distribution on latent codes.
- Mechanism: By adding a Kullback-Leibler divergence term to the loss function, HQARF encourages the quantized latent distribution to match a categorical prior, which regularizes the codebook and improves generalization across different signal instances.
- Core assumption: Matching the prior distribution leads to more stable and diverse reconstructions that retain class-discriminative information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model is trained using a combination of reconstruction loss, quantization loss, and generative loss."
  - [section]: "Finally, after training this hierarchical vector-quantized HAE, we add a generative loss function and retrain HQARF to its final version."
- Break condition: If the prior is mismatched to the data distribution, the generative loss may force unnatural clustering in the codebook, degrading both reconstruction quality and classification accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector quantization and codebook training
  - Why needed here: HQARF relies on learning a discrete codebook that maps continuous latent vectors to finite indices; understanding how to train and update this codebook is essential for effective compression.
  - Quick check question: How does the commitment loss in VQ-VAE training balance between keeping the encoder output close to codebook vectors and allowing the codebook to adapt?

- Concept: Variational autoencoders and generative modeling
  - Why needed here: HQARF extends VAEs with quantization; understanding the ELBO objective, reconstruction loss, and KL divergence is critical for grasping how generative loss improves compression.
  - Quick check question: What role does the KL divergence term play in regularizing the latent space, and why is it important for compression?

- Concept: Hierarchical neural network design
  - Why needed here: The stacked VQ-VAE layers in HQARF progressively compress data; knowing how to design and train such hierarchies is key to controlling compression rates.
  - Quick check question: Why does the second dimension of the latent representation halve at each hierarchy level, and how does this affect overall compression ratio?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input RF samples → Encoder (E0) → Quantizer (Q0) → Decoder (D0) → Reconstruction (L0)
  Optionally → Encoder (E1) → Quantizer (Q1) → Decoder (D1) → Reconstruction (L1) → … → L4

- Critical path:
  Complex-valued RF samples (1024×2) → 3-layer CNN encoder → Vector quantization → 3-layer transposed CNN decoder → Reconstructed RF samples

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger codebook size improves reconstruction fidelity but increases storage and latency
  - Deeper hierarchy yields higher compression but risks losing discriminative features
  - Including generative loss stabilizes training but may slow convergence

- Failure signatures:
  - Classification accuracy drops sharply when codebook size is too small or codewords are poorly distributed
  - Unstable training manifests as fluctuating loss curves, often due to aggressive codebook resets
  - Phase information loss appears as degraded constellation diagrams in scatter plots

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a single-layer VQ-VAE (L0 only) on 6Mod dataset and evaluate classification accuracy vs compression ratio
  2. Add a second hierarchical layer (L1) and compare performance against L0-only model
  3. Experiment with different codebook sizes (e.g., 32 vs 64 codewords) and observe effects on reconstruction quality and classification accuracy

- Compression rate optimization is not fully characterized beyond 20:1, with unknown degradation curves at higher compression levels
- Phase information preservation is not quantified, though it's critical for phase-sensitive modulation schemes

## Confidence

- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of generative loss (KL divergence) in improving reconstruction fidelity
- Low confidence: The optimal codebook reset policy and its impact on long-term training stability

## Next Checks

1. Monitor codeword usage statistics and visualize codeword distribution using t-SNE during training to verify all codewords are utilized and no codewords collapse to similar values

2. Generate constellation diagrams for compressed/reconstructed signals at different compression levels and quantify phase distortion using circular statistics to correlate with classification accuracy drops

3. Evaluate HQARF-compressed signals on a different RF dataset (real-world collected signals rather than synthetic) to verify learned codebook captures generalizable signal features rather than dataset-specific artifacts
