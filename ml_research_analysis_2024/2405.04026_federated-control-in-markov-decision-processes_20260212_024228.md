core_contribution: This paper studies federated control problems in MDPs where multiple
  agents with limited capabilities collaboratively learn the optimal policy without
  communicating locally collected experience. To address heterogeneity among restricted
  regions, the authors introduce leakage probabilities to quantify state transitions

# Federated Control in Markov Decision Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.04026
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04026
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a federated Q-learning protocol (FedQ) for collaborative RL in Markov Decision Processes with heterogeneous regions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses federated control in Markov Decision Processes where multiple agents with limited capabilities must learn optimal policies without sharing local experiences. The authors introduce leakage probabilities to model state transitions across heterogeneous regions and propose the Federated-Q protocol (FedQ). Agents periodically aggregate Q-functions from their local regions and modify their learning problems accordingly. The framework provides theoretical guarantees for FedQ's correctness and derives sample complexity bounds for different variants of the protocol.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a federated Q-learning framework where agents operate in restricted regions of a larger MDP. Each agent learns a local Q-function based on its region's dynamics and periodically aggregates Q-values from other regions using leakage probabilities that quantify cross-region state transitions. The FedQ protocol allows agents to collaboratively learn the globally optimal Q-function without directly sharing experience data. The authors provide a general sample complexity result for FedQ-X (where X is any RL oracle) and derive tight bounds specifically for FedQ-SynQ.

## Key Results
- FedQ-X achieves linear speedup in sample complexity when workload is uniformly distributed
- FedQ-SynQ converges efficiently to the globally optimal Q-function in various experimental environments
- Theoretical guarantees for FedQ's correctness under Markovian transitions and bounded leakage probabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The federated Q-learning framework works by leveraging leakage probabilities to model cross-region state transitions without requiring direct experience sharing. Agents maintain local Q-functions but periodically synchronize with other regions through aggregation. This allows each agent to incorporate knowledge about the global MDP structure while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead.

## Foundational Learning

- Q-learning: Why needed - fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm for learning optimal action-value functions. Quick check - temporal difference learning and Bellman optimality equations.
- Federated learning: Why needed - enables collaborative learning without sharing raw data. Quick check - understanding privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigms.
- Sample complexity: Why needed - quantifies the number of samples required for learning. Quick check - PAC bounds and convergence rates in RL.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Local Q-functions -> Aggregation module -> Global Q-function estimation
**Critical path**: Experience collection in local region -> Q-function update -> Periodic aggregation -> Convergence to global optimum
**Design tradeoffs**: Aggregation frequency vs. convergence speed vs. communication overhead
**Failure signatures**: Slow convergence with high leakage probabilities, divergence with incorrect leakage probability estimates, sub-optimal policies with insufficient aggregation
**First experiments**:
1. Validate convergence on simple grid-world MDPs with known optimal solutions
2. Test sensitivity to aggregation frequency and leakage probability estimation errors
3. Compare FedQ-SynQ performance against centralized Q-learning baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on idealized assumptions about Markovian transitions and bounded leakage probabilities
- Practical performance sensitive to aggregation frequency and leakage probability estimation accuracy
- Assumes perfect knowledge of transition model for theoretical guarantees

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Theoretical framework for FedQ and its correctness guarantees under stated assumptions
**Medium confidence**: Practical effectiveness of FedQ-SynQ in real-world scenarios with imperfect leakage probability estimates
**Low confidence**: Tight sample complexity bounds in highly heterogeneous environments with complex transition dynamics

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation of FedQ's sensitivity to aggregation frequency and leakage probability estimation errors in diverse environments
2. Extension of theoretical analysis to non-uniform workload distributions and its impact on sample complexity bounds
3. Comparison of FedQ with alternative federated RL approaches under varying communication constraints and transition dynamics
