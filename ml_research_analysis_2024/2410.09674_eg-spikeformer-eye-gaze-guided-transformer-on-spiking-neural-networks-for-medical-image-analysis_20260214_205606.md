# EG-SpikeFormer: Eye-Gaze Guided Transformer on Spiking Neural Networks for Medical Image Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.09674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09674
- Reference count: 29
- State-of-the-art accuracy: 94.32% on INbreast, 88.28% on SIIM-ACR

## Executive Summary
EG-SpikeFormer introduces a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates eye-gaze data with spiking neural networks (SNNs) for medical image analysis. By incorporating radiologists' gaze patterns as prior information, the model guides attention to diagnostically relevant regions, effectively addressing shortcut learning issues in small clinical datasets. The hybrid architecture combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the feature extraction capabilities of Transformers. On INbreast and SIIM-ACR datasets, EG-SpikeFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with accuracy scores of 94.32% and 88.28% respectively, while maintaining significantly lower energy consumption than traditional deep learning approaches. This demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic computing for resource-constrained medical environments requiring both high performance and interpretability.

## Method Summary
EG-SpikeFormer integrates eye-gaze data with spiking neural networks by using gaze patterns as attention priors to guide the SNN processing of medical images. The architecture combines Transformer-based feature extraction with SNN processing to leverage both high-dimensional feature learning and neuromorphic efficiency. The model uses eye-tracking data collected from radiologists during image examination to identify diagnostically relevant regions, which are then used to modulate the spiking activity and attention mechanisms within the network. This hybrid approach aims to overcome the limitations of small medical datasets while maintaining energy efficiency through spike-based computation.

## Key Results
- Achieves 94.32% accuracy on INbreast breast cancer detection dataset
- Achieves 88.28% accuracy on SIIM-ACR pneumothorax detection dataset
- Demonstrates significant energy efficiency improvements over traditional deep learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of eye-gaze data provides domain expert knowledge that guides the neural network's attention to clinically relevant regions, reducing the model's reliance on spurious correlations and dataset-specific shortcuts. By combining this expert-guided attention with the temporal processing capabilities of SNNs, the model can better capture diagnostic patterns that may be subtle or time-dependent. The Transformer component provides robust feature extraction while the SNN component offers energy-efficient processing and potentially better handling of temporal dynamics in medical imaging data. This multi-modal approach leverages both biological plausibility and expert knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Spiking Neural Networks**: Artificial neural networks that communicate through discrete spikes rather than continuous values

**Transformer Architecture**: Attention-based neural network architecture originally developed for natural language processing
- Why needed: Extract high-dimensional features from medical images
- Quick check: Confirm attention weights focus on diagnostically relevant regions

**Eye-Gaze Integration**: Incorporation of radiologist gaze patterns as attention priors
- Why needed: Guide model attention to clinically relevant regions and reduce shortcut learning
- Quick check: Validate gaze patterns correlate with diagnostic importance

**Neuromorphic Computing**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
- Why needed: Enable energy-efficient processing suitable for resource-constrained medical environments
- Quick check: Compare energy consumption with traditional deep learning approaches

**Attention Mechanisms**: Neural network components that focus processing on specific input regions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Eye-Gaze Data -> Transformer Feature Extractor -> SNN Processor -> Classification Layer

**Critical Path**: Eye-gaze patterns modulate attention weights in Transformer, which generates features for SNN processing, with final classification based on accumulated spike activity

**Design Tradeoffs**: Hybrid architecture balances the high feature extraction capability of Transformers with the energy efficiency of SNNs, but adds complexity in integrating gaze data and managing different computational paradigms

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on images with atypical gaze patterns, degraded accuracy when eye-gaze data is noisy or incomplete, potential overfitting to specific radiologists' gaze patterns

**First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study comparing performance with and without eye-gaze guidance
2. Energy consumption benchmarking against traditional CNN architectures
3. Attention visualization to verify gaze-guided regions align with diagnostic features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation across diverse medical imaging modalities beyond breast cancer and pneumothorax detection
- Energy consumption claims require experimental verification on actual neuromorphic hardware
- Integration mechanism of eye-gaze data with SNN framework lacks detailed implementation specifics

## Confidence
- Performance claims: Medium
- Energy efficiency claims: Low-Medium
- Clinical applicability: Low-Medium
- Interpretability benefits: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of eye-gaze guidance versus the SNN architecture alone
2. Implement the model on neuromorphic hardware (e.g., Loihi) to verify actual energy consumption claims
3. Test the model across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI, pathology) to assess generalizability
