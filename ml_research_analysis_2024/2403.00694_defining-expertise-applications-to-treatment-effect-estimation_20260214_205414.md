# Defining Expertise: Applications to Treatment Effect Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.00694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00694
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces "expertise" as an inductive bias for treatment effect estimation, showing predictive vs. prognostic expertise significantly impacts method performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the concept of "expertise" as an inductive bias for treatment effect estimation in machine learning. The authors define two types of expertise - predictive (based on treatment effects) and prognostic (based on potential outcomes) - and demonstrate that the type of expertise present in a dataset significantly impacts the performance of different treatment effect estimation methods. Through experiments, they show that balancing representations can hurt performance under predictive expertise but improve it under prognostic expertise. The paper also proposes a method to estimate the amount of predictive vs. prognostic expertise in a dataset, which can guide model selection. By correctly identifying the type of expertise, their "Expertise-informed" pipeline achieves the best-of-both-worlds performance across different expertise scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework that distinguishes between predictive expertise (where treatment effects are easier to estimate than potential outcomes) and prognostic expertise (where potential outcomes are easier to estimate than treatment effects). They derive conditions under which each type of expertise arises, primarily based on the linear confounding assumption. The framework connects expertise to existing literature on representation learning in causal inference, showing how balancing representations can be beneficial under prognostic expertise but harmful under predictive expertise. They also propose an empirical method to estimate the ratio of predictive to prognostic expertise in a dataset by comparing the performance of different model architectures on separate treatment and control groups.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that balancing representations can hurt performance under predictive expertise but improve it under prognostic expertise
- Proposes a method to estimate the amount of predictive vs. prognostic expertise in a dataset
- Shows that their "Expertise-informed" pipeline achieves the best-of-both-worlds performance across different expertise scenarios
- Validates theoretical claims through experiments on synthetic data with varying levels of predictive and prognostic expertise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's framework works by recognizing that different datasets contain different types of information about the causal relationships between variables. When predictive expertise is present, the treatment effect is more easily estimable than the potential outcomes, while under prognostic expertise, the reverse is true. This distinction matters because different estimation methods rely on different assumptions about which type of information is more readily available. By identifying which type of expertise is present, one can select or adapt methods that leverage the available information most effectively.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Treatment effect estimation**: Why needed - Core problem being addressed; Quick check - Can the method estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from observational data?

2. **Balancing representations**: Why needed - Common approach in causal inference that can be beneficial or harmful depending on expertise type; Quick check - Does the method use or avoid balancing representations based on estimated expertise?

3. **Linear confounding assumption**: Why needed - Theoretical foundation for defining expertise types; Quick check - Does the analysis assume linear relationships between confounders and outcomes?

4. **Predictive vs. prognostic expertise**: Why needed - Key conceptual distinction that drives method selection; Quick check - Can the method correctly identify which type of expertise is present in a dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data -> Expertise Estimation -> Model Selection -> Treatment Effect Estimation

Critical path: The pipeline begins with estimating the ratio of predictive to prognostic expertise in the data, then selects an appropriate estimation method based on this ratio. Under predictive expertise, methods that directly estimate treatment effects are preferred, while under prognostic expertise, methods that first estimate potential outcomes are more effective.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between using balancing representations (beneficial under prognostic expertise but harmful under predictive expertise) versus direct treatment effect estimation approaches. The proposed solution is to first estimate the expertise type and then adapt the method accordingly.

Failure signatures: Methods will fail when the assumed expertise type does not match the actual expertise present in the data. Specifically, balancing-based methods will underperform under predictive expertise, while direct treatment effect methods will struggle under prognostic expertise.

First experiments:
1. Generate synthetic data with varying levels of predictive expertise and test different estimation methods
2. Apply expertise estimation method to real datasets with known causal structure
3. Compare "Expertise-informed" pipeline performance against baseline methods across diverse datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical results rely heavily on the linear confounding assumption, which may not hold in many real-world applications
- Experimental evaluation is limited to specific synthetic data generation processes
- Claim that predictive expertise "arises naturally" in many settings needs more empirical support from real-world datasets
- Practical utility of expertise estimation method depends on accuracy in real datasets where true expertise type is unknown

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical framework and the basic distinction between predictive and prognostic expertise
- Medium confidence: The proposed expertise estimation method and its practical utility
- Medium confidence: The experimental results showing performance differences under different expertise types

## Next Checks
1. Test the expertise estimation method on real observational datasets where the true expertise type can be reasonably inferred from domain knowledge
2. Evaluate method performance under non-linear confounding structures beyond the linear case
3. Conduct a comprehensive empirical study across multiple real-world datasets to verify that the predicted patterns of method performance based on expertise type hold in practice
