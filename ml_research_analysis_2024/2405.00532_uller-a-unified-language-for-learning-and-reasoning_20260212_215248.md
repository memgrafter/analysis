# ULLER: A Unified Language for Learning and Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.00532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00532
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Introduces ULLER, a unified language for neuro-symbolic AI that enables comparing different frameworks by expressing knowledge in a common format

## Executive Summary
ULLER addresses the challenge of comparing different neuro-symbolic frameworks by providing a unified first-order logic syntax with statement bindings. This language simplifies composing functions and processing data pipelines while supporting multiple semantics including classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics. The authors demonstrate that ULLER can express knowledge used in existing neuro-symbolic systems and prove that its semantics converge to classical logic when functions are deterministic.

## Method Summary
ULLER is built on a first-order logic foundation with specially designed statement bindings (x := f(T, ..., T)(F)) that simplify function composition. The language treats neural networks as functions and supports multiple semantic interpretations through different neuro-symbolic systems. Knowledge is expressed once in ULLER syntax and can be evaluated under classical, fuzzy, or probabilistic semantics. The method involves parsing ULLER programs, applying symbol interpretations, selecting appropriate semantics, and evaluating formulas for learning or reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- ULLER provides a unified syntax that can express knowledge from existing neuro-symbolic systems
- The language supports multiple semantics including classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics
- Formal proofs show ULLER's semantics converge to classical logic when functions are deterministic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ULLER enables seamless switching between different neuro-symbolic systems through a common interface
- Mechanism: By providing a unified first-order logic syntax with statement bindings, ULLER decouples the knowledge representation syntax from the semantics implemented by different NeSy systems. This allows users to express knowledge once in ULLER and then apply different semantic interpretations (classical, fuzzy, probabilistic) without rewriting the knowledge.
- Core assumption: The statement binding syntax can adequately represent all knowledge currently used in existing neuro-symbolic systems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ULLER provides a first-order logic syntax with statement bindings that simplifies composing functions and processing data pipelines, while supporting multiple semantics including classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics"
  - [section] "The syntax of ULLER, defined in Section 2, is syntactic sugar around first-order logic (FOL), with specifically designed statement bindings"
- Break condition: If there exists knowledge in current NeSy systems that cannot be expressed in ULLER's syntax, or if the statement binding mechanism proves insufficient for complex function compositions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ULLER reduces the barrier to entry for neuro-symbolic research by eliminating the need to learn multiple incompatible knowledge representation languages
- Mechanism: Instead of requiring researchers to master the specific syntax of each NeSy framework (first-order logic, propositional logic, logic programming, etc.), ULLER provides a single, unified syntax that can express knowledge for all existing systems. This allows newcomers to focus on the core concepts rather than syntax variations.
- Core assumption: A single unified syntax can adequately cover the expressivity needs of all major neuro-symbolic approaches
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This heterogeneity hinders accessibility for newcomers and makes comparing different NeSy frameworks challenging. We propose a unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER"
  - [section] "We opt for a FOL-like syntax. It generalises propositional logic, while being a common language for declaring general constraints"
- Break condition: If practitioners find that the unified syntax imposes significant constraints on their ability to express domain-specific knowledge or if the learning curve for ULLER itself proves prohibitive

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ULLER enables formal proofs about the behavior of neuro-symbolic systems through its well-defined semantics
- Mechanism: By providing precise semantics for how formulas are interpreted under different NeSy systems, ULLER allows researchers to prove properties like "classical in the limit" - that a system converges to classical logic when functions are deterministic. This enables rigorous analysis and comparison of different approaches.
- Core assumption: The semantic definitions provided are mathematically sound and comprehensive enough to capture the behavior of real NeSy implementations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The authors demonstrate that ULLER can express knowledge used in existing neuro-symbolic systems and prove that its semantics converge to classical logic when functions are deterministic"
  - [section] "We formally introduce this notion by noting we can transform any program into a deterministic program by choosing the mode of the distribution like in Equation 15"
- Break condition: If the formal semantics fail to capture important practical considerations in real implementations, or if the proofs don't translate to practical guarantees about system behavior

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: First-order logic (FOL) syntax and semantics
  - Why needed here: ULLER is built on FOL foundations, and understanding quantifiers, predicates, functions, and logical connectives is essential for reading and writing ULLER programs
  - Quick check question: Can you express "for all x in domain D, if P(x) then Q(x)" in FOL notation and explain what each component means?

- Concept: Probabilistic reasoning and conditional probability distributions
  - Why needed here: ULLER's semantics include probabilistic interpretations where functions are treated as conditional distributions, which is crucial for understanding how neural networks with uncertainty are integrated
  - Quick check question: If a function f represents a neural network classifier with output distribution over classes, how would you compute the probability that a formula is true given this distribution?

- Concept: Type systems and dynamic typing
  - Why needed here: ULLER is dynamically typed, and understanding how typing works (or doesn't work) in the language is important for debugging and writing correct programs
  - Quick check question: What happens if you apply a function expecting numerical inputs to a string argument in ULLER, and how does this differ from statically typed languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Syntax layer: Context-free grammar defining ULLER language (terms, formulas, statements)
  - Interpretation layer: Mapping symbols to meanings (domains, predicates, functions, constants)
  - Semantics layer: Different NeSy systems (classical, fuzzy, probabilistic) that interpret formulas
  - Application layer: Learning and reasoning tasks using the above components

- Critical path:
  1. Parse ULLER program into abstract syntax tree
  2. Apply interpretation to map symbols to concrete meanings
  3. Select appropriate NeSy system semantics
  4. Evaluate formula under chosen semantics
  5. For learning: compute gradients and update parameters
  6. For reasoning: find optimal inputs or verify constraints

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. tractability: First-order logic is very expressive but leads to computationally expensive inference
  - Dynamic vs. static typing: Dynamic typing simplifies syntax but can lead to runtime errors
  - Unified syntax vs. specialized syntax: A single syntax covers all cases but may be less optimal for specific scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - Syntax errors: Invalid ULLER programs that don't conform to the grammar
  - Semantic errors: Programs that are syntactically correct but have undefined interpretations
  - Tractability issues: Programs that are theoretically valid but computationally intractable to evaluate
  - Type errors: Runtime failures due to type mismatches in dynamically typed expressions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple MNIST digit classification example using ULLER's statement syntax to express that the neural network output should match the true label
  2. Compare the same knowledge base expressed in ULLER across classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic semantics to observe how different interpretations affect results
  3. Create a benchmark suite with multiple datasets and knowledge bases to test the claim that ULLER enables easier comparison between NeSy systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can ULLER handle infinite or continuous domains in fuzzy semantics where current definitions are unclear?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We do not give a semantics for continuous or infinite domains in the fuzzy semantics, as we do not know of a standard definition in the neuro-symbolic literature."
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states uncertainty about standard definitions for continuous domains in fuzzy semantics within the neuro-symbolic literature.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a standard fuzzy semantics approach for continuous domains in neuro-symbolic systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can ULLER be implemented as a practical Python library that effectively lowers barriers to entry for neuro-symbolic research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The long-term goal is to create a Python library implementing ULLER to be shared among the significant NeSy systems."
- Why unresolved: While the goal is stated, the paper does not provide a concrete implementation or user testing to validate the library's effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working Python library with documentation, benchmarks, and user feedback demonstrating ease of use and accessibility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can gradient estimation methods be efficiently integrated into ULLER for training neural networks with sampling semantics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "However, since sampling is not a differentiable operation, it is not possible to use this semantics to train the neural networks."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the challenge but does not provide a concrete solution or implementation for gradient estimation in sampling semantics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method or algorithm that successfully estimates gradients for ULLER programs using sampling semantics, validated with experimental results.

## Limitations

- No empirical validation showing actual performance improvements or reduced development time
- The paper does not address scalability concerns for large knowledge bases
- Dynamic typing may lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug
- The claim that all existing neuro-symbolic knowledge can be expressed in ULLER remains unproven without concrete translation examples

## Confidence

- Claim: ULLER enables seamless switching between neuro-symbolic systems through unified syntax - High confidence
- Claim: ULLER reduces barriers to entry for neuro-symbolic research - Medium confidence
- Claim: Formal proofs about convergence to classical logic are mathematically sound - High confidence

## Next Checks

1. Implement a benchmark suite comparing the same neuro-symbolic task expressed in ULLER versus native frameworks, measuring both development time and inference performance
2. Create a comprehensive translation guide from existing neuro-symbolic languages (PyNeuraLogic, Logical Neural Networks, etc.) to ULLER syntax
3. Conduct user studies with researchers new to neuro-symbolic AI to measure learning curves and productivity when using ULLER versus traditional approaches
