# No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment via Graph Convolutional Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.07728
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07728
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves SRCC of 0.9301 and 0.8091 on SJTU and WPC databases respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art quality assessment metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GC-PCQA, a no-reference point cloud quality assessment method that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to predict perceptual quality scores. The approach projects point clouds into multiple 2D views from different viewpoints to simulate human visual perception, then constructs a graph based on spatial relationships between these views. GCNs are used to aggregate feature information across the graph and predict quality scores. Experimental results on two benchmark databases demonstrate superior performance compared to existing quality assessment metrics, with strong generalization capabilities across different distortion types and content.

## Method Summary
GC-PCQA converts 3D point clouds into multi-view 2D projections using horizontal and vertical rotations with a 36° stride, generating 20 projected images per point cloud. These images are processed through a pre-trained ResNet101 backbone with attention blocks to extract features, which are then fused across different network layers. A graph is constructed where each node represents a projected image feature, with edges based on rotation stride distances. Two separate GCN branches process horizontal and vertical view features through multiple graph convolutional layers, with outputs fused through multi-level fusion before final quality score prediction via a fully connected layer.

## Key Results
- Achieves SRCC of 0.9301 on SJTU database and 0.8091 on WPC database
- Outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment metrics across all tested databases
- Demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different distortion types and content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method achieves superior performance by using GCN to model mutual dependencies between multi-view projected images.
- Mechanism: Graph Convolutional Networks aggregate feature information from neighboring nodes based on spatial relationships, allowing the model to capture contextual information across different projected views that would be missed by independent processing.
- Core assumption: The spatial relationships between projected images (based on rotation stride) encode meaningful perceptual dependencies that correlate with human quality judgments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "reasoning on the constructed graph is performed by GCN to characterize the mutual dependencies and interactions between different projected images"
  - [section]: "we build a graph based on the correlation between those multi-view projected images by taking each projected image feature representation as a node in the graph"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on LiDAR and point cloud perception quality, not GCN-based multi-view approaches
- Break condition: If the spatial relationships between projected images do not correlate with human perception, or if GCN cannot effectively aggregate features across views, performance would degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-view projection mimics human visual perception, leading to better quality assessment.
- Mechanism: By projecting point clouds from multiple viewpoints (horizontal and vertical), the method captures information that would be visible to human observers from different angles, rather than relying on limited fixed-plane projections.
- Core assumption: Human visual perception of 3D objects depends on observing them from multiple viewpoints, and this behavior can be effectively simulated through multi-view projection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We simulate the perceptual process of HVS to perform multi-view projection on the 3D point cloud"
  - [section]: "the HVS reconstructs 3D objects in their mind based on multiple two-dimensional (2D) plane images observed from different viewpoints"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus focuses on LiDAR quality assessment and 3D reconstruction, not specifically on multi-view projection for quality assessment
- Break condition: If human perception of point cloud quality does not actually depend on multi-view observation, or if the chosen rotation stride fails to capture perceptually relevant information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Attention blocks improve feature representation by emphasizing quality-relevant information.
- Mechanism: The attention mechanism (spatial and channel attention) weights feature maps to focus on important regions and channels, reducing the influence of quality-unrelated white regions and noise.
- Core assumption: Not all regions and channels in projected images contain quality-relevant information; some regions (like white backgrounds) are quality-unrelated and should be suppressed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "an additional image pre-processing step is performed...to effectively remove the non-informative white background regions"
  - [section]: "The attention mechanism comes from the research on human vision and draws lessons from the attention thinking of the human vision"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't discuss attention mechanisms in the context of point cloud quality assessment
- Break condition: If quality degradation affects all regions equally, or if the attention mechanism incorrectly suppresses quality-relevant information, performance would suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
  - Why needed here: Point clouds and their multi-view projections form non-Euclidean data structures where traditional CNNs are inefficient, requiring GCNs to model spatial relationships and aggregate features across nodes
  - Quick check question: How does a GCN differ from a traditional CNN in handling non-grid data structures?

- Concept: Multi-view projection and rotation stride
  - Why needed here: To simulate human visual perception of 3D objects by capturing information from multiple viewpoints, rather than relying on fixed-plane projections
  - Quick check question: Why is the rotation stride threshold set to 36° in the adjacency matrix construction?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms (spatial and channel attention)
  - Why needed here: To focus feature extraction on quality-relevant regions and channels while suppressing noise and quality-unrelated information in projected images
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between spatial attention and channel attention, and why are both needed in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multi-view projection → Feature extraction → Attention → Multi-level conversion → Graph construction → GCN → Multi-level fusion → Quality prediction
- Critical path: Multi-view projection → Feature extraction → Attention → Multi-level conversion → Graph construction → GCN → Multi-level fusion → Quality prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained ResNet101 vs. training from scratch: Faster convergence and better feature extraction vs. potentially better adaptation to point cloud domain
  - Two separate GCNs vs. single shared GCN: Better specialization for horizontal/vertical views vs. parameter efficiency
  - Rotation stride of 36° vs. finer/coarser: Good balance of coverage vs. redundancy and computational cost
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor correlation with subjective scores: Indicates issues with feature extraction, graph construction, or GCN architecture
  - High variance across cross-validation folds: Suggests overfitting or sensitivity to training data composition
  - Slow inference time: May indicate need for model compression or architectural optimization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test GCN performance vs. simple feature concatenation without graph modeling to validate the benefit of mutual dependency modeling
  2. Vary rotation stride (24°, 36°, 48°, 60°) to find optimal balance between coverage and redundancy
  3. Compare different backbone architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, etc.) to identify best feature extractor for this task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the proposed GC-PCQA method perform on point cloud databases with different compression standards or coding tools beyond those tested in the current work?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention testing on two publicly available databases (SJTU and WPC) and demonstrate superior performance, but do not explicitly explore performance across various compression standards or coding tools.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing GC-PCQA with existing methods but does not systematically investigate how it generalizes across different compression standards or coding tools.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using GC-PCQA on point cloud databases compressed with different standards (e.g., V-PCC, G-PCC, Draco) and reporting performance metrics would provide insights into its generalization capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the rotation stride (RS) beyond the tested values (24°, 36°, 48°, 60°) on the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conduct experiments with RS values of 24°, 36°, 48°, and 60° and report performance and running time, but do not explore values outside this range.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a limited exploration of RS values, and the optimal RS might lie outside the tested range.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with RS values both smaller and larger than those tested, while measuring performance and computational efficiency, would determine the optimal RS range for the proposed method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed GC-PCQA method handle point clouds with varying densities or point distributions, and what modifications, if any, would be necessary for optimal performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on point cloud quality assessment but does not explicitly address the impact of varying point cloud densities or distributions on the proposed method's performance.
- Why unresolved: Point clouds in real-world scenarios can have varying densities and distributions, which might affect the proposed method's performance, but this aspect is not explored in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using point clouds with different densities and distributions, while measuring the performance of GC-PCQA, would reveal its robustness and potential need for modifications.

## Limitations

- The method relies on fixed 36° rotation stride for multi-view projection, which may not capture all perceptually relevant viewpoints for every point cloud
- Results are validated only on two benchmark databases, limiting generalizability to real-world point clouds
- The paper does not address computational efficiency or scalability to larger point clouds

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The GCN architecture implementation and feature extraction pipeline are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance claims (SRCC values) are supported by cross-validation results, but the limited dataset diversity warrants caution in generalizing these results
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority claims over state-of-the-art metrics are supported by comparative experiments, though the specific baseline methods and their configurations are not fully detailed

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate the trained model on additional point cloud datasets (e.g., MPEG, Waterloo) not seen during training to assess real-world generalization capabilities.

2. **Rotation Stride Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the rotation stride (24°, 36°, 48°, 60°) and measure the impact on SRCC scores to identify the optimal balance between coverage and redundancy for different point cloud types.

3. **Ablation on Graph Construction**: Compare performance using different graph construction methods (rotation stride-based vs. learned adjacency, different node feature dimensions) to validate that the current approach provides the claimed benefits of mutual dependency modeling.
