# Limited but consistent gains in adversarial robustness by co-training object recognition models with human EEG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03646
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03646
- Reference count: 40
- This study found that co-training object recognition models with human EEG data produces modest but statistically significant improvements in adversarial robustness.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether co-training object recognition models with human EEG data can improve adversarial robustness. The researchers trained ResNet50-based models on a dual task of image classification and EEG prediction using a large-scale EEG dataset collected while participants viewed real-world images. They evaluated model robustness against various adversarial attacks (L2/PGD, L∞/PGD, and L2/C&W) and measured the correlation between adversarial robustness gains and EEG prediction accuracy. The results showed a significant positive correlation between models' EEG prediction accuracy (highest around 100 ms post-stimulus onset) and their gains in adversarial robustness, though the effect size was modest.

## Method Summary
The researchers trained 24 ResNet50-based models on the THINGS dataset with dual-task objectives: image classification and EEG prediction. EEG data was recorded from 10 subjects viewing 16,540 natural images across 1,654 object categories. The models were trained for 200 epochs using Adam optimizer with learning rate 5e-6 and weight decay 0.0. Four architecture clusters were tested: CNN (dense layers), RNN (LSTM/recurrent), Transformer, and Attention layers. Adversarial robustness was evaluated using L2/PGD, L∞/PGD, and L2/C&W attacks. EEG prediction accuracy was measured using Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and actual EEG signals.

## Key Results
- Significant positive correlation (0.53-0.61, p < 1e-6) between EEG prediction accuracy and adversarial robustness gains
- EEG prediction accuracy peaked around 100 ms post-stimulus onset
- Mid-level parieto-occipital channels (PO7, PO3, PO4, PO8, POz) showed strongest contribution to robustness gains despite being less well-predicted than early visual channels
- Similar robustness gains were observed when using shuffled versions of EEG data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EEG prediction accuracy at specific temporal windows correlates with adversarial robustness gains
- Mechanism: Dual-task training aligns ANN representations with human neural dynamics, improving model generalization
- Core assumption: Human visual processing patterns captured in EEG contain generalizable features that enhance network robustness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "observed significant correlation between the networks' EEG prediction accuracy, often highest around 100 ms post stimulus onset, and their gains in adversarial robustness"
  - [section] "we observed significant positive correlation values (between 0.53-0.61, p-values < 1e-6) implying that the robustness of the models scaled with the ability of the networks to better capture the statistics from the neural data"
  - [corpus] Weak - no directly comparable studies found in corpus
- Break condition: If EEG prediction accuracy does not improve with training or if correlation breaks down across different initialization seeds

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parieto-occipital EEG channels contribute more to robustness gains than early visual channels despite being less well-predicted
- Mechanism: Later-stage visual processing features captured in parieto-occipital regions contain more discriminative information for adversarial robustness
- Core assumption: The information flow in human visual processing makes later stages more relevant for robustness than early sensory processing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "mid-level parieto-occipital channels (PO7, PO3, PO4, PO8, POz) showed the strongest contribution to robustness gains"
  - [section] "the channels overlaying the early visual cortex seemed to be best predicted, those in the parieto-occipital region... showed the highest correlation values, indicating that it were the statistics from these channels that particularly aided in enhancing the robustness"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks studies on channel-specific contributions to adversarial robustness
- Break condition: If early visual channel predictions become more strongly correlated with robustness gains, or if channel contributions reverse

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Co-training with EEG provides regularization benefits similar to control conditions (shuffled/random EEG)
- Mechanism: The statistical structure of EEG signals, regardless of semantic content, provides a form of regularization that improves generalization
- Core assumption: The temporal and spatial patterns in EEG data contain regularization properties that benefit network training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "similar robustness gains when using shuffled versions of the EEG data"
  - [section] "the control (shuffled and random) versions of the EEG, and thus the mere statistics of the signal, also helped in rendering robustness to the ANNs"
  - [corpus] Moderate - Related work on "Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in SNNs with Sparse Gradients" suggests regularization approaches may transfer across network types
- Break condition: If regularization benefits disappear when using truly random signals with no temporal structure

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial examples and their detection
  - Why needed here: Understanding how small perturbations can fool networks is essential for evaluating robustness improvements
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes L2, L∞, and C&W adversarial attacks in terms of their perturbation constraints?

- Concept: Pearson correlation coefficient and its interpretation
  - Why needed here: EEG prediction accuracy is evaluated using PCC, and correlation between PCC and robustness gains is a key finding
  - Quick check question: How would you interpret a PCC value of 0.32 between predicted and actual EEG at 100ms post-stimulus?

- Concept: Sliding window analysis for temporal data
  - Why needed here: Identifying the optimal time window for EEG prediction that correlates with robustness gains requires understanding sliding window techniques
  - Quick check question: If you move a 60ms window across 100 time points with 10ms steps, how many correlation values would you compute?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - ResNet50 backbone (classification branch) -> EEG prediction branch (independent component per architecture variant) -> Dual-task loss function balancing classification and EEG prediction -> Adversarial attack evaluation pipeline (PGD L2/L∞, C&W)

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess EEG data (epoching, downsampling, normalization)
  2. Train ResNet50 on image classification with ImageNet pre-training
  3. Add EEG prediction branch and co-train with dual-task loss
  4. Evaluate EEG prediction accuracy using PCC
  5. Generate adversarial examples and measure robustness gains
  6. Correlate EEG prediction accuracy with robustness gains

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Early vs. late fusion of features for EEG prediction (Models 4-5 vs. 2-3 in Table 1 show different tradeoffs)
  - RNN vs. Transformer vs. Attention for temporal EEG prediction
  - Complexity of EEG prediction branch vs. classification performance

- Failure signatures:
  - EEG prediction accuracy remains near zero across all channels
  - No correlation between PCC and robustness gains across multiple runs
  - Robustness gains disappear when using control (shuffled/random) EEG
  - Early visual channels show strongest correlation with robustness instead of parieto-occipital

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a baseline ResNet50 on image classification only, then add a simple fully-connected EEG predictor and measure initial correlation
  2. Compare EEG prediction accuracy and robustness gains across different random seeds to verify consistency
  3. Test the effect of using only early visual channels vs. parieto-occipital channels on both prediction accuracy and robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can larger EEG datasets with different stimulus conditions (e.g., auditory) similarly improve adversarial robustness?
- Can the observed EEG-regularization approach be used as a pre-training method to improve baseline robustness of ANNs?
- What specific statistical elements of neural activity are networks utilizing to improve robustness?

## Limitations
- Effect size is modest (correlation 0.53-0.61) and doesn't report absolute robustness values
- Temporal specificity uncertainty - optimal window identified at 100ms but analysis may miss true peak
- Control conditions suggest benefits may come from statistical regularization rather than semantic information

## Confidence
- High Confidence: EEG prediction accuracy correlates positively with adversarial robustness gains
- Medium Confidence: Parieto-occipital channels contribute more to robustness than early visual channels
- Medium Confidence: Dual-task training provides regularization benefits similar to control conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test whether the correlation between EEG prediction accuracy and robustness gains holds on a completely independent EEG dataset with different subjects and stimuli
2. Systematically vary EEG preprocessing parameters to determine which aspects are critical for the observed effects
3. Compare robustness gains from co-training with EEG versus other forms of temporal regularization to isolate whether the benefit comes from brain-specific information or general temporal structure
