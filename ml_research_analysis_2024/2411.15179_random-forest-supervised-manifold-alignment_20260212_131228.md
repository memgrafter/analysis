# Random Forest-Supervised Manifold Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.15179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15179
- Authors: Jake S. Rhodes; Adam G. Rustad
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Random forest proximities improve cross-domain feature integration and classification performance in semi-supervised manifold alignment

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a semi-supervised manifold alignment method that uses random forest proximities to improve cross-domain feature integration and classification performance. The authors enhance two existing graph-based alignment methods (MASH and SPUD) by initializing them with geometry-preserving random forest proximities, creating RF-MASH and RF-SPUD variants. Experiments across 16 datasets with various domain adaptation strategies show that these RF-initialized methods typically outperform both single-domain baselines and traditional alignment approaches, with RF-MASH achieving the highest accuracy improvements.

## Method Summary
The method enhances semi-supervised manifold alignment by initializing graph-based alignment algorithms (MASH and SPUD) with random forest proximities. Random forest models are trained on each domain, and their proximity matrices serve as supervised initialization for constructing cross-domain relationships. The RF-GAP proximities encode instance-level relationships that reflect the decision space structure while maintaining local neighborhood structures and incorporating class label information without overfitting. These proximities are then used to build cross-domain similarity matrices that preserve the supervised geometry during the alignment process.

## Key Results
- RF-MASH achieved the highest accuracy improvements, outperforming single-domain baselines by 10.1% with Gaussian noise adaptation and 13.8% with QR rotations
- Both MASH and SPUD initialized with random forests outperformed their unsupervised counterparts across most dataset types and adaptation strategies
- RF-SPUD showed the most consistent performance across all adaptation methods, achieving improvements in 75% of dataset-adaptation combinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RF-GAP proximities provide geometry-preserving supervision that outperforms traditional kernel initialization in manifold alignment
- Mechanism: Random forest proximities encode instance-level relationships that reflect the decision space structure, creating a row-stochastic diffusion operator that maintains local neighborhood structures while incorporating class label information without overfitting
- Core assumption: The decision space structure captured by random forest terminal nodes contains meaningful geometric information that transfers across domains through anchor points
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These proximities serve as a supervised initialization for constructing cross-domain relationships that maintain local neighborhood structures, thereby facilitating alignment"
  - [section III] "RF-GAP proximities form a row-stochastic diffusion operator which encodes similarities within a given domain. The supervised information, however, is encoded in a way that does not overfit to the training data"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations about RF-GAP performance in manifold alignment, though related work exists on forest proximities

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The combination of supervised initialization with semi-supervised alignment creates embeddings with sufficient information for downstream classification
- Mechanism: Random forest proximities provide initial domain-specific structure, then diffusion processes (MASH) or shortest paths (SPUD) build cross-domain relationships while preserving the supervised geometry from the initialization
- Core assumption: Initial supervised structure can be preserved through subsequent semi-supervised alignment processes without losing discriminative information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By contrast, we find that alignment models that use random forest proximities or class-label information achieve improved accuracy on downstream classification tasks, outperforming single-domain baselines"
  - [section IV] "Both MASH and SPUD [7] are typically initialized with a kernel matrix for each domain using the α-decaying kernel. Instead, we initialize each model using RF-GAP proximities"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work on diffusion maps and manifold alignment suggests this approach is viable, though specific to RF initialization

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Feature-level domain splits create realistic multimodal scenarios where random forest proximities provide superior initialization compared to unsupervised methods
- Mechanism: By treating different feature subsets as separate domains, the random forest proximity initialization captures feature relevance patterns that transfer across domains, while traditional methods lack this supervised guidance
- Core assumption: Feature relevance patterns learned in one domain are meaningful and transferable to other domains with related but distinct features
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V] "For the skewed split, features were divided according to feature relevance as assessed by a random forest model; the most relevant features formed one domain, while the remaining formed the other"
  - [section V] "Generally, methods initialized with random forests outperformed their unsupervised counterparts"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations about feature-level domain splits, though related work on multimodal learning exists

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Random Forest Proximities
  - Why needed here: They provide the supervised initialization that distinguishes this method from traditional unsupervised manifold alignment approaches
  - Quick check question: How do random forest proximities differ from traditional distance metrics in capturing instance relationships?

- Concept: Manifold Alignment
  - Why needed here: Understanding the core problem of finding shared low-dimensional representations across domains is essential for grasping why the random forest initialization matters
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between supervised and semi-supervised manifold alignment?

- Concept: Diffusion Maps and Shortest Path Algorithms
  - Why needed here: These are the core mechanisms (MASH and SPUD) that build cross-domain relationships after the random forest initialization
  - Quick check question: How do diffusion processes differ from shortest path approaches in learning cross-domain relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Feature-level domain split → Random forest model training → RF-GAP proximity calculation → Cross-domain similarity matrix construction → MASH/SPUD alignment → Embedding generation → Downstream classification
- Critical path: The random forest model training and RF-GAP proximity calculation are the critical path, as errors here propagate through the entire alignment process
- Design tradeoffs: Supervised initialization vs. computational cost (training random forests), cross-domain similarity construction vs. scalability, diffusion vs. shortest path for different data structures
- Failure signatures: Poor downstream classification accuracy indicates initialization failure; inconsistent embeddings across different random forest seeds suggest instability; excessive computational time may indicate scalability issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare random forest proximity initialization vs. traditional kernel initialization on a simple two-domain dataset with clear feature relevance patterns
  2. Test sensitivity to anchor point selection by varying the proportion of anchors and measuring downstream classification impact
  3. Evaluate performance across different domain split types (random, skewed, even) to understand when RF initialization provides the most benefit

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do RF-MASH and RF-SPUD perform on multimodal datasets where the domains are not simply feature splits or noise-added variants, but genuinely different data types (e.g., text and images)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on feature-level splits and simple domain adaptations (noise addition, rotations), but doesn't explore cross-modal scenarios with fundamentally different data types.
- Why unresolved: The experimental setup uses artificial domain splits rather than real multimodal data, limiting understanding of performance on truly heterogeneous data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying RF-MASH and RF-SPUD to genuine multimodal datasets (text-image pairs, audio-visual data, etc.) with quantitative comparison to existing multimodal alignment methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between the information captured by random forest proximities and the preservation of discriminative information in the aligned embedding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that RF proximities "encode the relationships between data points through random forest proximities, we can establish a meaningful connection between domains through neighboring points" and that these "design also prevents overfitting when used in downstream tasks."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates empirical improvements, it doesn't provide theoretical justification for why RF proximities specifically lead to embeddings that better preserve discriminative information.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis connecting RF proximity properties (such as local metric adaptivity) to manifold alignment quality metrics and downstream classification performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are RF-MASH and RF-SPUD to the choice of anchor points, and what strategies can optimize anchor selection for alignment quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "partial correspondence between points is known" and that "points known to belong to both domains (i.e., xi and yj form alternative representations of the same point in X and Y, respectively)" are used as anchors, but doesn't explore sensitivity to anchor selection.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use 30% of data points as anchors without investigating how performance varies with different anchor selection strategies or proportions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying anchor selection methods (random, importance-based, etc.) and proportions, along with analysis of the relationship between anchor quality and alignment performance.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the random forest proximity initialization be extended to other manifold alignment methods beyond MASH and SPUD to achieve similar improvements?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates success with RF proximities on MASH and SPUD but doesn't explore whether this initialization strategy generalizes to other alignment frameworks.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to two specific alignment methods, leaving open whether the RF proximity advantage is method-specific or broadly applicable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying RF proximity initialization to other alignment methods (SSMA, JLMA, KEMA, etc.) with comparative analysis of performance improvements across different algorithmic frameworks.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning domain adaptation methods like domain adversarial neural networks, which could potentially outperform the proposed graph-based approaches
- The computational scalability of RF-MASH and RF-SPUD for large datasets with many features is not addressed, though random forest training becomes expensive as feature dimensionality increases
- The sensitivity analysis to anchor point selection is limited, with only 30% anchors used across experiments, which may not represent optimal configurations for all dataset types

## Confidence

- High confidence in the general effectiveness of random forest proximities for improving manifold alignment accuracy, based on consistent performance improvements across 16 datasets and multiple domain adaptation strategies
- Medium confidence in the scalability and generalizability of the approach to real-world multimodal scenarios with high-dimensional features, given the limited dataset sizes and feature counts tested
- Low confidence in the absolute performance claims without direct comparison to deep learning baselines, as the field has shifted toward neural approaches for domain adaptation

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark RF-MASH and RF-SPUD against domain adversarial neural networks and other deep learning domain adaptation methods on the same 16 datasets
2. Test computational scalability on synthetic high-dimensional datasets (100+ features) to evaluate practical limitations
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis for anchor point proportions (5%, 10%, 30%, 50%) to identify optimal configurations across different dataset characteristics
