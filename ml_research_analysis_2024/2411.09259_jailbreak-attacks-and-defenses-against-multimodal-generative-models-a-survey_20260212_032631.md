# Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses against Multimodal Generative Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.09259
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09259
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Systematic survey of jailbreak attacks and defenses across multimodal generative models

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of jailbreak attacks and defensive strategies against multimodal generative models, covering text, image, audio, and video modalities. The authors present a unified framework that analyzes attacks and defenses across four key stages: input, encoder, generator, and output. They systematically categorize attack methods into black-box, gray-box, and white-box approaches, while defense strategies are classified as discriminative or transformative. The survey also examines various input-output configurations including Any-to-Text, Any-to-Vision, and Any-to-Any models, and identifies current research challenges and future directions.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology to examine jailbreak attacks and defenses against multimodal generative models. The authors analyze research papers across multiple databases and sources, categorizing findings into a unified framework that spans four operational stages of multimodal models. They classify attack methods based on the level of model access (black-box, gray-box, white-box) and defense strategies based on their operational mechanism (discriminative vs transformative). The survey also compiles evaluation datasets and metrics used in the field, while identifying research gaps and proposing future directions.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive taxonomy of jailbreak attacks (black-box, gray-box, white-box) across multimodal models
- Classification of defense strategies into discriminative and transformative approaches
- Coverage of multiple input-output configurations (Any-to-Text, Any-to-Vision, Any-to-Any)
- Identification of current research challenges and future research directions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a systematic framework that captures the attack-defense dynamics across all stages of multimodal generative models. By organizing attacks and defenses according to the model's operational pipeline (input → encoder → generator → output), the authors can identify how adversarial inputs at each stage can bypass safety mechanisms. The unified approach allows for cross-modality analysis and reveals patterns in attack effectiveness and defense robustness that might be obscured when examining single-modality systems in isolation.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Generative Models**: AI systems that can process and generate content across multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video). *Why needed:* Essential context for understanding the scope of jailbreak attacks. *Quick check:* Verify the survey covers all four major modalities mentioned.

**Jailbreak Attacks**: Techniques designed to bypass safety mechanisms and elicit harmful content from AI systems. *Why needed:* Core threat model being analyzed. *Quick check:* Confirm classification into black-box, gray-box, and white-box categories.

**Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in controls that prevent generative models from producing harmful or restricted content. *Why needed:* Target of jailbreak attacks. *Quick check:* Verify discussion of different safety mechanism types across modalities.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input → Encoder → Generator → Output (the four stages of multimodal processing)

**Critical Path**: The attack path typically follows: Adversarial Input → Encoder Bypass → Generator Exploitation → Harmful Output Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Model access level vs. attack effectiveness (black-box vs. white-box)
- Defense accuracy vs. computational overhead
- Safety vs. model utility

**Failure Signatures**:
- Consistent bypass of safety filters
- Generation of harmful content despite guardrails
- Degradation in model performance under attack

**First Experiments**:
1. Test black-box attacks on text-to-image models using prompt engineering
2. Evaluate discriminative defense filters against multimodal adversarial inputs
3. Assess white-box gradient-based attacks on encoder representations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The survey identifies several open questions including the need for more robust evaluation metrics that can effectively measure both attack success rates and defense effectiveness across different modalities. The authors also highlight the challenge of developing universal defense mechanisms that work across all input-output configurations and modalities. Additionally, they call for research into understanding the fundamental vulnerabilities in multimodal models that make them susceptible to jailbreak attacks, and how these vulnerabilities differ from single-modality systems.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of attack effectiveness and defense robustness
- Potential gaps in coverage of emerging attack methods and defense strategies
- Lack of quantitative analysis of success rates across different attack-defense combinations
- Possible bias toward more commonly studied modalities (text and images) over audio and video

## Confidence

**Taxonomy Comprehensiveness:** Medium - Claims systematic coverage but lacks specific validation
**Unified Framework Validity:** Medium - Proposed framework applicability across modalities not empirically tested
**Future Directions Relevance:** Medium - Specific examples and justification not provided in summary

## Next Checks

1. Verify the survey's claim of comprehensive coverage by checking if it includes all major attack methods (black-box, gray-box, white-box) with specific examples and their success rates against different multimodal models.

2. Examine the proposed unified framework by testing its applicability across different modality combinations (text, image, audio, video) to ensure it can indeed capture the attack-defense dynamics across all configurations.

3. Validate the proposed future research directions by checking if they address concrete gaps identified through systematic analysis of current limitations in both attack methods and defense strategies.
