# Introspective Planning: Aligning Robots' Uncertainty with Inherent Task Ambiguity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.06529
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06529
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introspective planning improves LLM-based robot planning by aligning uncertainty with task ambiguity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on three tasks including a safe mobile manipulation benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces introspective planning, a method that helps language models (LLMs) better assess their own uncertainty when generating plans for robots. The key innovation is to construct a knowledge base with introspective reasoning examples, which are then retrieved during deployment to guide the LLM's planning process. The approach is designed to align the LLM's uncertainty with the inherent ambiguity of the task, improving both compliance and safety. Evaluated on three tasks, including a newly introduced safe mobile manipulation benchmark, introspective planning substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based planning methods. Additionally, when integrated with conformal prediction, it achieves tighter confidence bounds, maintaining statistical success guarantees while minimizing unnecessary user clarification requests.

## Method Summary
Introspective planning is a method that improves LLM-based robot planning by aligning the model's uncertainty with the inherent ambiguity of tasks. The approach constructs a knowledge base of introspective reasoning examples, which are retrieved during deployment to guide the LLM's planning process. This method aims to enhance both compliance and safety in robot planning. The approach is evaluated on three tasks, including a newly introduced safe mobile manipulation benchmark, and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art LLM-based planning methods. Additionally, when integrated with conformal prediction, introspective planning achieves tighter confidence bounds while maintaining statistical success guarantees, reducing unnecessary user clarification requests.

## Key Results
- Introspective planning outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based planning methods on three tasks, including a safe mobile manipulation benchmark
- The approach aligns LLM uncertainty with task ambiguity, improving both compliance and safety
- Integration with conformal prediction achieves tighter confidence bounds while maintaining statistical success guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Introspective planning works by constructing a knowledge base of introspective reasoning examples that are retrieved during deployment to guide the LLM's planning process. This mechanism helps align the LLM's uncertainty with the inherent ambiguity of the task, improving both compliance and safety. By integrating with conformal prediction, the approach achieves tighter confidence bounds while maintaining statistical success guarantees, reducing unnecessary user clarification requests.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Knowledge Base -> LLM Planning -> Task Execution
Critical Path: Knowledge Base Construction -> LLM Planning with Introspective Reasoning -> Task Execution with Conformal Prediction Integration
Design Tradeoffs: Balancing the size and diversity of the knowledge base with computational efficiency; integrating conformal prediction to maintain statistical guarantees while reducing user clarification requests
Failure Signatures: Poor performance when the knowledge base lacks relevant introspective reasoning examples; failure to align LLM uncertainty with task ambiguity; integration issues with conformal prediction leading to looser confidence bounds
First Experiments: 1) Test the robustness of the knowledge base construction process by varying its size and content. 2) Evaluate the approach on a broader set of tasks to assess task generalization. 3) Analyze the integration of introspective planning with conformal prediction in different environmental conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Knowledge Base Construction: The methodology for constructing the knowledge base is not fully detailed, and it is unclear how generalizable the approach is to new tasks.
- Task Generalization: The scope of evaluated tasks may not fully represent the diversity of real-world robot planning scenarios, and the approach's performance on tasks outside the evaluated set is unknown.
- Conformal Prediction Integration: The details of integrating introspective planning with conformal prediction are not fully elaborated, and the robustness of this integration to variations in task complexity and environmental conditions is unclear.

## Next Checks
1. Knowledge Base Robustness: Conduct experiments to test the robustness of the knowledge base construction process. Evaluate how the performance of introspective planning changes when the knowledge base is expanded, reduced, or modified to include different types of introspective reasoning examples.
2. Task Generalization: Evaluate the performance of introspective planning on a broader set of tasks, including those outside the evaluated set. Assess how well the approach scales to more complex, long-horizon tasks and how it performs in different environmental conditions.
3. Conformal Prediction Integration: Provide a more detailed analysis of the integration of introspective planning with conformal prediction. Evaluate the robustness of this integration to variations in task complexity and environmental conditions, and assess how it impacts the overall performance of the planning system.
