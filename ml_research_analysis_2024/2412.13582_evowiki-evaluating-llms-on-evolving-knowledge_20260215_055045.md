# EvoWiki: Evaluating LLMs on Evolving Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13582
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13582
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: EvoWiki dataset shows RAG+CL combination provides synergistic improvement on evolving knowledge tasks

## Executive Summary
EvoWiki is a novel dataset designed to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) handle knowledge that changes over time. The dataset categorizes knowledge into stable, evolved, and uncharted states based on the model's knowledge cutoff date, and includes multi-hop reasoning questions with referenced Wikipedia contexts and popularity metrics. Experiments demonstrate that while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves performance on simple questions, it struggles with complex reasoning tasks. Continual learning (CL) provides modest but consistent gains, and combining both methods leads to a synergistic effect that enhances performance across all knowledge types.

## Method Summary
EvoWiki constructs an evolving knowledge benchmark by detecting knowledge evolution through triple comparison across time-stamped Wikidata snapshots and corresponding Wikipedia pages. The dataset generates multi-hop reasoning questions with referenced contexts, then evaluates LLMs using closed-book, RAG, and CL configurations. The CL component includes both continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches, with experiments measuring exact match accuracy across stable, evolved, and uncharted knowledge categories.

## Key Results
- RAG improves performance on simple questions but shows limited effectiveness on multi-hop reasoning tasks
- CL provides consistent but modest improvements across all knowledge types, with SFT showing better results than CPT
- The combination of RAG and CL demonstrates a synergistic effect, significantly outperforming either method alone
- Knowledge popularity influences CL effectiveness, with lower popularity knowledge showing greater improvement after SFT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Categorizing knowledge into stable, evolved, and uncharted levels reduces contamination risk while enabling precise evaluation of LLM adaptation to evolving knowledge.
- Mechanism: By distinguishing knowledge states relative to the model's knowledge cutoff date, the benchmark ensures that evaluation questions target genuinely new or changed information rather than overlapping with training data.
- Core assumption: Knowledge evolution can be accurately detected by comparing triples across time-stamped snapshots of knowledge graphs and their corresponding Wikipedia pages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EvoWiki categorizes knowledge into stable, evolved, and uncharted states... mitigating potential contamination issues"
  - [section 3.1] "The evolution of a fact is determined in relation to the knowledge cut-off date of LLMs"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains papers on evolving benchmarks but lacks specific validation of contamination mitigation
- Break condition: If knowledge evolution detection is inaccurate (false positives/negatives), contamination risk remains and evaluation precision suffers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining RAG with CL creates a synergistic effect that improves LLM performance on evolving knowledge.
- Mechanism: RAG provides access to current external knowledge while CL updates the model's internal knowledge base, addressing both immediate retrieval needs and long-term adaptation.
- Core assumption: RAG and CL complement each other - RAG handles immediate knowledge gaps while CL enables sustainable knowledge integration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the dataset highlights a synergistic effect between RAG and CL, demonstrating their potential to better adapt to evolving knowledge"
  - [section 4.5] "The combination of RAG and CL demonstrates a synergistic effect. Integrating RAG with CL enhances performance across data types"
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus includes papers on RAG and CL individually but limited evidence on their combination for evolving knowledge
- Break condition: If either RAG or CL performs poorly, the synergistic effect diminishes and combined performance may not exceed individual methods.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge popularity influences CL effectiveness, with lower popularity knowledge showing greater improvement after SFT.
- Mechanism: Models learn new knowledge more effectively when it's less popular because there's less prior exposure to override during fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: Knowledge popularity correlates with prior exposure in training data, affecting how easily models can integrate new information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "the model appears to learn new knowledge more effectively when the popularity is lower"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks specific studies on popularity's impact on knowledge integration effectiveness
- Break condition: If popularity doesn't correlate with prior exposure, or if lower popularity indicates inherently harder-to-learn knowledge, the relationship breaks down.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge state classification (stable, evolved, uncharted)
  - Why needed here: Enables precise evaluation of LLM adaptation to different types of knowledge evolution
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between evolved and uncharted knowledge in the context of EvoWiki?

- Concept: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline
  - Why needed here: Core method for providing external knowledge access to LLMs
  - Quick check question: What are the main components of a RAG system and how do they interact?

- Concept: Continual learning (CL) methods
  - Why needed here: Essential for updating model's internal knowledge base with new information
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between CPT and SFT in the context of continual learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Knowledge Graph (Wikidata) -> Fact Classification -> Context Linking -> Question Generation -> Model Evaluation (RAG/CL)

- Critical path: Knowledge Graph → Fact Classification → Context Linking → Question Generation → Model Evaluation (RAG/CL)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Auto-updatability: Stricter filtering ensures quality but reduces auto-update frequency
  - Complexity vs. Coverage: Multi-hop questions test deeper reasoning but increase generation difficulty
  - RAG vs. CL balance: Different strengths require careful combination strategy

- Failure signatures:
  - High contamination: Indicates inadequate knowledge state classification
  - Poor multi-hop performance: Suggests retriever noise or model reasoning limitations
  - Inconsistent CL gains: Points to training data quality or hyperparameter issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline evaluation: Test closed-book performance across all knowledge states
  2. RAG ablation: Compare different retrievers (BM25 vs Contriever) and corpus sizes
  3. CL effectiveness: Measure CPT vs SFT vs combination performance on stable vs evolving knowledge

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the auto-updatable nature of EvoWiki handle potential noise and outdated information in Wikidata and Wikipedia sources?
- Basis in paper: explicit
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the use of distant supervision and consistency checks across Wikipedia snapshots to ensure data quality, it acknowledges that noise cannot be completely eliminated and suggests future work to reduce this noise using more aggressive relation filtering strategies and additional sources of timely knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of EvoWiki with and without the proposed noise reduction strategies, along with an analysis of the impact of noise on the evaluation results, would provide evidence for the effectiveness of the auto-updatable nature of EvoWiki in handling noise and outdated information.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific mechanisms and strategies employed by EvoWiki to mitigate potential test set contamination when evaluating newly released LLMs?
- Basis in paper: explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper states that EvoWiki is designed to be auto-updatable and contamination-free, but it does not provide detailed information on the specific mechanisms and strategies used to prevent test set contamination when evaluating newly released LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed explanation of the contamination prevention mechanisms, along with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies in maintaining a contamination-free evaluation environment for newly released LLMs, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Learning (CL) achieve a synergistic effect in improving the performance of LLMs on evolving knowledge?
- Basis in paper: explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that combining RAG and CL results in a synergistic effect, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms and interactions between these two methods that lead to this improvement.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the individual and combined effects of RAG and CL on different types of evolving knowledge, along with an investigation of the interactions between these methods, would provide insights into the synergistic effect and its impact on LLM performance.

## Limitations
- Knowledge evolution detection may introduce false positives/negatives, affecting evaluation precision
- The synergistic effect between RAG and CL lacks deeper mechanistic analysis
- Limited explanation of why knowledge popularity correlates with CL effectiveness

## Confidence

High confidence in dataset construction methodology, Medium confidence in major claims about RAG+CL synergy, Low confidence in causal explanations for performance patterns.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component in the RAG+CL combination
2. Test the knowledge evolution detection mechanism on datasets with ground-truth evolution labels to validate accuracy
3. Evaluate model performance on a subset of questions where human experts verify the knowledge state classifications
