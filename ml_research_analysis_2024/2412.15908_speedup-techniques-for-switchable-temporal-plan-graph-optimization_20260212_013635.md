# Speedup Techniques for Switchable Temporal Plan Graph Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15908
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15908
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: IGSES achieves over twice the success rate of baseline GSES and delivers 10- to 30-fold speedups on solvable instances

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Improved GSES (IGSES), an algorithm that accelerates switchable temporal plan graph (STPG) optimization by incorporating four speedup techniques: stronger admissible heuristics based on future cost estimation, maximal edge grouping for simultaneous branching decisions, prioritized edge selection using edge slack, and incremental longest-path computation. Experiments on four map types with up to 200 agents demonstrate that IGSES significantly outperforms the baseline GSES algorithm in both success rate and runtime efficiency.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes IGSES as an enhancement to the existing GSES algorithm for solving switchable temporal plan graph optimization problems. The key innovations include a stronger admissible heuristic that estimates future costs by considering unassigned agents' contributions, a maximal edge grouping technique that identifies edges with identical impacts on the objective function to enable simultaneous branching decisions, a priority-based edge selection strategy that prioritizes edges with larger slack values, and an incremental longest-path computation method that avoids redundant calculations. These techniques work together to reduce the search space and computational overhead while maintaining solution optimality.

## Key Results
- IGSES achieves over twice the success rate compared to baseline GSES
- Speedups of 10-30x on solvable instances
- Strong performance across four map types with up to 200 agents
- Maintains solution optimality while dramatically improving efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by combining multiple complementary speedup techniques that each address different aspects of the search complexity. The stronger heuristic reduces the search space by providing better lower bounds on solution costs. Maximal edge grouping allows the algorithm to make multiple branching decisions simultaneously when edges have identical impacts. Priority-based selection focuses computational resources on the most promising edges first. The incremental computation avoids redundant work by reusing previous calculations. Together, these techniques create a multiplicative effect that dramatically reduces both the number of search nodes and the time per node.

## Foundational Learning

**Switchable Temporal Plan Graphs (STPGs)**: Temporal planning graphs where edge switching operations can modify the graph structure to optimize an objective function. Needed to understand the problem domain being addressed. Quick check: Can you identify the key differences between STPGs and traditional temporal planning graphs?

**Admissible Heuristics**: Heuristic functions that never overestimate the true cost to reach a goal. Required for ensuring optimality in search algorithms. Quick check: Why is admissibility crucial for maintaining optimal solutions in branch-and-bound algorithms?

**Edge Slack**: The amount by which an edge can be modified without affecting the current solution's feasibility. Important for prioritizing search decisions. Quick check: How does edge slack relate to the sensitivity of the solution to changes in individual edges?

**Maximal Edge Grouping**: The technique of identifying and processing multiple edges simultaneously when they have identical impacts on the objective function. Useful for reducing redundant branching decisions. Quick check: What conditions must be met for edges to be grouped together in this technique?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: IGSES -> Strong Heuristic -> Maximal Edge Grouping -> Priority Selection -> Incremental Computation

Critical path: Search begins with initial graph state -> Strong heuristic guides node expansion -> Edges are grouped when possible -> Priority queue selects next edge to branch on -> Incremental computation updates longest paths -> Solution is found or search space is exhausted

Design tradeoffs: The algorithm trades increased implementation complexity for significant runtime improvements. The stronger heuristic requires additional computation per node but reduces total nodes expanded. Maximal edge grouping can lead to more complex branching logic but reduces search depth. Priority-based selection may miss some solutions in pathological cases but works well in practice.

Failure signatures: The algorithm may fail to find solutions when the branching factor becomes too large despite grouping. Performance degrades on graphs with highly irregular edge cost distributions. The heuristic may provide poor guidance in cases with many symmetric solutions.

First experiments:
1. Run IGSES on a small STPG instance with known optimal solution to verify correctness
2. Compare runtime of incremental longest-path computation vs naive recomputation on medium-sized instances
3. Test edge grouping effectiveness by measuring reduction in branching factor on graphs with many symmetric edges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on STPG domains, leaving generalizability to other temporal planning problems unclear
- Speedup techniques presented without formal proofs of admissibility, relying on empirical validation
- Choice of four specific map types may not represent full diversity of potential problem domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in core algorithmic contributions and their implementation
- Medium confidence in claimed speedups, given empirical nature of evidence
- Medium confidence in generalizability beyond STPG domains

## Next Checks
1. Test IGSES algorithm on non-STPG temporal planning problems to evaluate generalizability
2. Conduct formal analysis to prove admissibility of stronger heuristic under different conditions
3. Evaluate impact of maximal edge grouping technique on solution quality in addition to speed gains
