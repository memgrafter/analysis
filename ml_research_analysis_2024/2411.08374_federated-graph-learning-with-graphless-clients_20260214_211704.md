# Federated Graph Learning with Graphless Clients

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.08374
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08374
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** FedGLS outperforms five baselines on node classification with graphless clients across five real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a novel federated graph learning scenario where some clients lack graph structure data, possessing only node features. The proposed FedGLS framework enables collaborative training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by transferring structure knowledge from clients with complete graph data to graphless clients. The framework employs knowledge distillation to transfer structure knowledge via feature encoders, while contrastive learning guides graphless clients in generating appropriate graph structures. Experiments demonstrate that FedGLS achieves superior node classification accuracy and faster convergence compared to existing methods, particularly under varying ratios of graphless clients.

## Method Summary
FedGLS implements a federated learning framework where each client maintains a GNN model and feature encoder, while graphless clients additionally have a local graph learner. During training, graphless clients generate graph structures using the graph learner optimized by a contrastive loss that maximizes consistency between GNN and feature encoder outputs. Knowledge distillation transfers structure knowledge by having the feature encoder approximate GNN node embeddings. The central server aggregates local parameters using weighted averaging (FedAvg), enabling structure knowledge transfer among heterogeneous clients. The framework is evaluated on five real-world datasets with varying graphless client ratios and local epoch configurations.

## Key Results
- FedGLS consistently outperforms five baselines (Fed-GNNk, Fed-MLP, and others) in node classification accuracy across all five datasets
- The framework demonstrates faster convergence compared to baseline methods, particularly Fed-GNNk
- FedGLS shows robustness under varying local epochs (3, 5, 10) and different ratios of graphless clients (25%, 50%, 75%)
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of both knowledge distillation and contrastive loss components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Structure knowledge is effectively transferred from clients with graph data to graphless clients via feature encoder distillation.
- **Mechanism:** The feature encoder on each client approximates the GNN's node embeddings using knowledge distillation, thereby retaining and transferring structure knowledge during global updates.
- **Core assumption:** The feature encoder can effectively approximate the GNN's node embeddings without direct access to graph structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "the feature encoder retains the local graph structure knowledge together with the GNN model via knowledge distillation"
  - [section]: "The feature encoder approximates the output (i.e., node embeddings) of the GNN model using the knowledge learned by the GNN model."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about distillation effectiveness
- **Break condition:** If the feature encoder cannot effectively approximate GNN outputs, structure knowledge transfer fails and graphless clients cannot generate meaningful graph structures.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The contrastive loss enables graphless clients to learn local graph structures that align with transferred structure knowledge.
- **Mechanism:** The graph learner on each graphless client maximizes consistency between GNN and feature encoder outputs using a contrastive loss, encouraging the generation of adjacency matrices that reflect the structure knowledge.
- **Core assumption:** The contrastive loss can effectively guide the graph learner to produce graph structures consistent with the transferred knowledge.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The local graph learner utilizes the structure knowledge by maximizing the consistency between the output of the global GNN model and feature encoder on each graphless client with a contrastive loss."
  - [section]: "The local graph learner is optimized by maximizing the agreement with a contrastive loss... Our goal is to decrease the distance between positive pairs and increase the distance between negative pairs."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence about contrastive loss effectiveness in corpus neighbors
- **Break condition:** If the contrastive loss fails to properly guide graph structure generation, the learned graphs will be unsuitable for node classification.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** FedAvg aggregation effectively combines local updates from heterogeneous clients (those with and without graph data).
- **Mechanism:** The central server collects local parameters from all clients and computes new global parameters using weighted averaging based on node counts, allowing both graph and graphless clients to contribute to the global model.
- **Core assumption:** Weighted averaging via FedAvg can effectively combine parameters from clients with different model architectures and data availability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "the structure knowledge is transferred among clients in global update"
  - [section]: "The central server collects the local parameters of the two modules from the clients and gets the global parameters. In this way, FedGLS transfers structure knowledge among clients."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence about FedAvg effectiveness with heterogeneous clients in corpus neighbors
- **Break condition:** If FedAvg fails to properly aggregate heterogeneous client parameters, the global model will not effectively represent the combined knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**
  - Why needed here: FedGLS relies on GNNs to learn node embeddings from graph structures, which is the foundation for understanding how structure knowledge is learned and transferred.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between GNNs and traditional neural networks in terms of input data?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation**
  - Why needed here: Knowledge distillation is the mechanism by which the feature encoder learns to approximate GNN outputs, enabling structure knowledge transfer without sharing graph data.
  - Quick check question: In knowledge distillation, what role does the "teacher" model play compared to the "student" model?

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning**
  - Why needed here: Contrastive learning guides the graph learner to generate graph structures that align with transferred structure knowledge by maximizing consistency between different representations.
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental principle behind contrastive learning objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** GNN model (all clients) -> Feature encoder (all clients) -> Graph learner (graphless clients only) -> Central server (FedAvg aggregation)
- **Critical path:** Local training → Parameter collection → FedAvg aggregation → Parameter broadcast → Next round
  The feature encoder distillation and graph learner contrastive loss must both work effectively for the system to function.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Using knowledge distillation allows structure knowledge transfer without sharing graph data, but adds computational overhead
  - Contrastive loss helps generate suitable graph structures but requires careful tuning of temperature parameter
  - FedAvg aggregation is simple but may not be optimal for heterogeneous client architectures
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor classification accuracy despite training indicates feature encoder cannot effectively approximate GNN outputs
  - Graphless clients perform similarly to Fed-MLP baseline indicates graph learner fails to generate useful structures
  - Training instability or slow convergence indicates issues with contrastive loss or FedAvg aggregation
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run FedGLS on Cora dataset with 50% graphless clients and compare accuracy against Fed-GNNk baseline
  2. Vary the number of local epochs (3, 5, 10) and measure impact on convergence speed and final accuracy
  3. Gradually increase the ratio of graphless clients (25%, 50%, 75%) to test system robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The framework may not recover underlying graph structures on graphless clients since it produces fixed k neighbors for each node
- Generated graph structures may not match unknown real-world structure information
- The framework does not address how to handle dynamic graphs where edge information changes over time during federated training

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** FedGLS outperforms Fed-GNNk baseline in node classification accuracy - supported by multiple datasets and ablation studies
- **Medium confidence:** Knowledge distillation effectively transfers structure knowledge to graphless clients - mechanism described but not directly validated
- **Medium confidence:** Contrastive loss enables graphless clients to generate suitable graph structures - theoretical framework provided but empirical validation limited to final classification performance

## Next Checks
1. **Component isolation test:** Run FedGLS without the graph learner on graphless clients (treating them as feature-only clients) to isolate the contribution of structure generation versus feature learning
2. **Structure quality analysis:** Measure graph reconstruction quality metrics (e.g., link prediction accuracy) on the generated graphs from graphless clients to validate if they capture meaningful relationships
3. **Cross-client transfer evaluation:** Test whether structure knowledge transferred to graphless clients improves when the source clients have more diverse or representative graph structures, quantifying the knowledge transfer efficiency
