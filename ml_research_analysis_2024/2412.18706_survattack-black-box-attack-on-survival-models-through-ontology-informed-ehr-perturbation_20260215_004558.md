# SurvAttack: Black-Box Attack On Survival Models through Ontology-Informed EHR Perturbation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.18706
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18706
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces first black-box adversarial attack framework for survival analysis models, achieving up to 63.56% c-index reduction and 5.72 MAE increase

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SurvAttack, the first black-box adversarial attack framework specifically designed for survival analysis models in electronic health records. The core method employs a greedy algorithm that manipulates medical codes using three adversarial actions (remove, replace, add) prioritized by a composite scoring strategy based on saliency, perturbation stealthiness, and clinical meaningfulness. The approach leverages ontology-informed synonym code selection and semantic similarity functions to maintain clinical consistency while perturbing the input data. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant performance degradation across multiple state-of-the-art survival models, revealing vulnerabilities in survival models' decision-making processes.

## Method Summary
SurvAttack is a black-box adversarial attack framework that targets survival analysis models using electronic health records. The method employs a greedy algorithm that manipulates medical codes through three adversarial actions: remove, replace, and add. These actions are prioritized using a composite scoring strategy that balances saliency (impact on model output), perturbation stealthiness, and clinical meaningfulness. The framework uses ontology-informed synonym code selection to find clinically valid substitutes and semantic similarity functions to maintain attack stealthiness. A Dynamic SA-specific (DSA) strategy then orchestrates population-level attacks by sequentially targeting censored and observed patients to disrupt survival rankings.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 63.56% reduction in c-index across multiple survival models
- Increased MAE by up to 5.72 for survival time predictions
- Successfully maintained clinically meaningful perturbations while degrading model performance
- Demonstrated effectiveness against CoxCC, DeepSurv, N-MTLR, and DeepHit survival models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The greedy algorithm prioritizes perturbations that maximize survival model output degradation while maintaining clinical consistency. For each medical code, it evaluates three adversarial actions and scores them using a composite function combining saliency index (output change) and similarity index (semantic preservation). The core assumption is that the composite scoring function properly balances attack effectiveness with stealthiness by exponentially weighting similarity.

### Mechanism 2
Ontology-informed synonym code selection maintains clinical reality while providing attack vectors. The framework uses medical ontology hierarchies and co-occurrence probabilities to identify clinically meaningful substitute codes that are statistically consistent with the original. The core assumption is that sibling codes with high co-occurrence probabilities represent clinically valid alternatives that won't raise suspicion.

### Mechanism 3
Dynamic SA-specific (DSA) strategy efficiently disrupts patient ranking by targeting censored and observed patients differently. DSA first attacks censored patients to reduce their predicted survival time, then sorts observed patients and attacks them to maintain an incorrect ranking order, all while minimizing the number of attacks needed. The core assumption is that sequential updating of target time can convert all permissible pairs to discordant with one attack per patient.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Survival analysis and censored data handling
  - Why needed here: The attack framework specifically targets survival models that handle both observed and censored data, requiring understanding of how these models estimate survival functions and rank patients
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes survival analysis from standard regression, and why does censored data complicate the ranking task?

- **Concept**: Medical ontologies and code hierarchies
  - Why needed here: The SCS strategy relies on understanding how medical codes are organized in ontologies (like ICD-9 and ATC) to find semantically similar substitutes
  - Quick check question: How do medical ontologies represent relationships between codes, and why is this structure important for maintaining clinical consistency during attacks?

- **Concept**: Semantic similarity in embedding spaces
  - Why needed here: The SSF function uses deep embeddings to measure semantic similarity between original and perturbed EHRs, which is critical for maintaining attack stealthiness
  - Quick check question: How does the semantic similarity function differ from simple code-count-based similarity measures, and why is this distinction important for EHR attacks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CCS -> SCS/SSF evaluation -> Greedy attack execution -> DSA ranking disruption
- **Critical path**: The composite code scoring mechanism (CCS) identifies the most promising adversarial actions, which are then validated through synonym code selection (SCS) and semantic similarity evaluation (SSF) before being executed via the greedy algorithm and orchestrated by the DSA strategy.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades attack strength for stealthiness by incorporating semantic similarity constraints, and trades computational efficiency for comprehensive coverage by using greedy search instead of exhaustive optimization.
- **Failure signatures**: High failure rates indicate either overly strict similarity thresholds or insufficient synonym code options; low attack effectiveness suggests the composite scoring function needs rebalancing.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run CCS on a sample patient to verify composite scores align with expected saliency/similarity trade-offs
  2. Test SCS with varying co-occurrence thresholds to find the sweet spot between clinical validity and attack options
  3. Execute DSA on a small patient cohort to validate the sequential ranking disruption approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the SurvAttack framework be extended to handle multi-task survival models that predict multiple competing risks simultaneously? The current greedy algorithm and composite scoring strategy are optimized for single-event scenarios, but multi-risk scenarios would require balancing perturbations across different risk types while maintaining clinical consistency for each.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal threshold value for the semantic similarity function (SSF) that balances attack effectiveness with perturbation stealthiness across different clinical domains? The paper sets the SSF threshold to 0.90 empirically but acknowledges this may vary across clinical domains and does not provide systematic analysis of threshold sensitivity.

### Open Question 3
How does the computational efficiency of SurvAttack scale when applied to large-scale hospital systems with millions of patient records and hundreds of concurrent attacks? The paper reports approximately 18 seconds per attack on a specific hardware configuration but does not analyze scaling behavior or performance under concurrent attack scenarios typical of hospital environments.

## Limitations

- The black-box assumption validation is limited, with no testing of performance under constrained query budgets or partial model information
- Generalizability to other survival model architectures remains unverified beyond the four tested state-of-the-art models
- Clinical validity threshold calibration lacks systematic sensitivity analysis across different medical domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core greedy algorithm framework and composite scoring strategy are well-defined and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The ontology-informed synonym code selection strategy appears clinically meaningful but requires empirical validation across different medical domains
- **Medium Confidence**: The DSA strategy's ability to efficiently disrupt patient ranking with minimal attacks is demonstrated but may not generalize well to highly non-linear survival models

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the similarity threshold θ (0.7-0.95) and co-occurrence probability p (0.1-0.5) to quantify their impact on attack success rate, clinical validity of perturbations, and computational efficiency.

2. **Query budget constraint testing**: Implement and test the attack framework under varying query budget constraints (10, 50, 100, 500 queries per patient) to evaluate performance degradation and identify the minimum number of queries needed for effective attacks.

3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Apply the attack framework to survival analysis tasks in different medical domains (e.g., cancer prognosis, cardiovascular disease) using different EHR coding systems to validate generalizability beyond the AKI dataset.
