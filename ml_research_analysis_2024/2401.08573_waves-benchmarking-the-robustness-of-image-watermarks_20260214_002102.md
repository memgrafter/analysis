# WAVES: Benchmarking the Robustness of Image Watermarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.08573
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08573
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces WAVES benchmark revealing previously undetected vulnerabilities in modern watermarking algorithms

## Executive Summary
WAVES addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation of image watermarking robustness in the generative AI era. The benchmark evaluates three prominent watermarking methods - Tree-Ring, Stable Signature, and StegaStamp - across 26 attack types using three diverse datasets. By focusing on True Positive Rate at 0.1% False Positive Rate and measuring image quality degradation, WAVES reveals distinct vulnerability profiles: Tree-Ring's susceptibility to adversarial attacks, Stable Signature's weakness to regeneration attacks, and StegaStamp's overall robustness. The framework exposes the risks of using publicly available VAEs and provides actionable insights for developing more resilient watermarking systems.

## Method Summary
WAVES evaluates watermark robustness through detection and identification tasks across three datasets (DiffusionDB, MS-COCO, DALL·E3) with 5000 reference images each. The framework tests three watermarking methods under 26 attack types including distortions, regenerations, and adversarial attacks. Performance is measured using True Positive Rate at 0.1% False Positive Rate, while image quality is assessed across eight metrics. The evaluation protocol systematically varies attack strengths and analyzes the trade-off between watermark detection performance and image quality degradation through comprehensive visualization tools.

## Key Results
- Tree-Ring shows vulnerability to adversarial attacks due to its reliance on DDIM inversion and latent space features
- Stable Signature is particularly weak against regeneration attacks that circumvent its specific VAE decoder dependencies
- StegaStamp demonstrates the most robust performance across all attack categories, maintaining effectiveness while minimizing quality degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Standardized evaluation across diverse attack types reveals previously undetected vulnerabilities in watermarking algorithms.
- Mechanism: Systematic application of 26 attack types across three datasets at 0.1% FPR with eight quality metrics exposes weaknesses missed by inconsistent evaluation methods.
- Core assumption: Diverse attack types and realistic datasets are necessary to uncover true watermark vulnerabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our novel, comprehensive evaluation reveals previously undetected vulnerabilities of several modern watermarking algorithms."
  - [section 2] "However, a lack of standardized evaluations in existing literature... has resulted in an incomplete picture of the vulnerabilities and robustness of these algorithms in the real world."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different watermarking methods have distinct vulnerabilities to specific attack categories.
- Mechanism: Tree-Ring's vulnerability to adversarial attacks stems from its reliance on DDIM inversion and latent space features, while Stable Signature's weakness to regeneration attacks arises from its dependence on specific VAE decoders.
- Core assumption: The design architecture of each watermarking method determines its vulnerability profile.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "Tree-Ring is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks likely due to its unique watermark detection process... disturbances inside this domain significantly hinder watermark recovery."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using publicly available VAEs in watermarking systems creates significant security risks.
- Mechanism: Grey-box adversarial embedding attacks using the same VAE as the watermarking system can effectively remove watermarks by altering latent features without visual degradation.
- Core assumption: Access to the VAE encoder used in watermarking provides sufficient information for effective attacks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "An adversarial embedding attack using the same VAE easily compromises Tree-Ring by altering latent features with little visual change."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: True Positive Rate at 0.1% False Positive Rate (TPR@0.1%FPR)
  - Why needed here: Watermark detection requires extremely low false positive rates to avoid mislabeling legitimate content, making this metric critical for practical applications.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper prioritize TPR@0.1%FPR over AUROC scores for watermark evaluation?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks on latent representations
  - Why needed here: Understanding how perturbations in latent space can remove watermarks without visible quality loss is essential for evaluating watermark robustness.
  - Quick check question: How do grey-box adversarial embedding attacks differ in effectiveness from black-box attacks on watermarking systems?

- Concept: Regeneration attacks using diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Regeneration attacks can strip watermarks by transferring images through different VAEs or diffusion models, exploiting dependencies in watermarking protocols.
  - Quick check question: Why are rinsing regenerations (multiple cycles of noising/denoising) particularly effective against certain watermarking methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Attack generation module (distortions, regenerations, adversarial attacks) -> Watermark embedding module (Stable Signature, Tree-Ring, StegaStamp) -> Evaluation pipeline (TPR@0.1%FPR calculation, image quality metrics) -> Results aggregation and visualization (Performance vs Quality plots, radar plots, leaderboards)

- Critical path:
  1. Embed watermark into test images
  2. Apply attack at varying strengths
  3. Measure detection performance (TPR@0.1%FPR)
  4. Evaluate image quality degradation
  5. Generate performance vs quality plots
  6. Aggregate results across datasets and attacks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Conservative attack strengths vs. realistic threat modeling
  - Comprehensive quality metrics vs. evaluation complexity
  - Grey-box vs. black-box attack assumptions

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent performance across different datasets
  - High false positive rates in detection
  - Quality degradation below acceptable thresholds

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run distortion attacks on all three watermarks with minimum strength settings
  2. Evaluate regeneration attacks on Stable Signature with varying VAE types
  3. Test grey-box adversarial embedding attacks on Tree-Ring using the same VAE encoder

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the robustness of watermarks change when attackers have access to the watermarking algorithm or the generative model parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that enhanced attacker knowledge, such as the watermarking algorithm, could facilitate more effective adversarial attacks, as explored in (Lukas et al., 2023).
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation focuses on realistic attacks where attackers have very limited knowledge. The effectiveness of attacks with more knowledge is not thoroughly explored.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the trade-off between watermark robustness and image quality degradation for different watermarking methods and attack types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces Performance vs. Quality 2D plots to visualize the trade-off between watermark detection performance and image quality degradation.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of this trade-off, it does not delve into the specific mechanisms or strategies to optimize this balance for different watermarking methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How effective are hybrid watermarking approaches that combine different watermarking methods or incorporate redundant bits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions potential strategies to improve robustness, including combining different watermarks to leverage their strengths and incorporating redundant bits (error correction coding).
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the effectiveness of these hybrid approaches or provide empirical evidence of their benefits.

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on specific watermarking implementations that may not represent the full spectrum of modern watermarking techniques
- Attack strengths are described as conservative, potentially underestimating real-world vulnerability scenarios
- Focus on image-level watermarking may not capture the complexities of pixel-level watermarking systems

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The benchmark framework design, attack methodology, and performance measurement protocols are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific vulnerability findings for each watermarking method are robust within the tested parameters but may vary with different implementations or attack strengths
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of attack effectiveness to all watermarking systems and the real-world impact of identified vulnerabilities require further validation

## Next Checks

1. Test WAVES against additional watermarking algorithms beyond the three evaluated to assess benchmark comprehensiveness
2. Increase attack strengths beyond the conservative settings to evaluate worst-case scenario vulnerabilities
3. Validate findings across different image domains and resolutions to ensure results generalize beyond the three datasets used
