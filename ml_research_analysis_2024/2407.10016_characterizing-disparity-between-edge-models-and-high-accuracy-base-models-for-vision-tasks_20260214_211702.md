# Characterizing Disparity Between Edge Models and High-Accuracy Base Models for Vision Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.10016
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10016
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** XDELTA achieves 78.86% accuracy on MIT Indoor Scenes with only 4.55M parameters and 1.98G FLOPS, demonstrating effective model compression while preserving accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in explainable AI for edge computing by introducing XDELTA, a novel tool that characterizes differences between high-accuracy base models and lower-accuracy edge models for vision tasks. XDELTA employs a learning-based approach using a DELTA network that complements the feature representation capability of edge networks in a compact form. The system is evaluated across four popular image datasets (ImageNet-1K, CIFAR10, MIT Indoor Scenes, COCO) using over 1.2 million images and 24 models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in model compression while preserving accuracy.

The research provides both geometric and concept-level analysis to explain model differences, with the DELTA network constructed through a structured subgraph extraction algorithm and a new objective function that balances feature representation quality and complementarity between edge and DELTA models. A real-world deployment experiment with six participants using 421 mobile phone images across eight environment categories validates XDELTA's practical effectiveness in edge computing scenarios.

## Method Summary
XDELTA introduces a novel explainable AI approach for characterizing disparities between base and edge models in vision tasks. The core mechanism involves a DELTA network that works complementarily with the edge network to enhance feature representation while maintaining computational efficiency. The method employs a structured subgraph extraction algorithm to construct the DELTA network, guided by an objective function that simultaneously optimizes feature representation quality and complementarity between the edge and DELTA models. This learning-based approach enables compact model compression while preserving accuracy, making it suitable for resource-constrained edge computing environments. The system provides explanations through both geometric analysis (comparing decision boundaries and feature spaces) and concept-level analysis (identifying which visual concepts contribute to model differences).

## Key Results
- XDELTA achieves 78.86% accuracy on MIT Indoor Scenes dataset with only 4.55M parameters and 1.98G FLOPS, compared to base ResNet18's 81.00% accuracy with 11.21M parameters and 2.38G FLOPS
- Comprehensive evaluation across 1.2 million images and 24 models on four popular datasets (ImageNet-1K, CIFAR10, MIT Indoor Scenes, COCO)
- Real-world deployment experiment with six participants using 421 mobile phone images across eight environment categories validates practical effectiveness
- State-of-the-art performance in model compression while preserving accuracy through geometric and concept-level analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
XDELTA works by introducing a complementary DELTA network that specifically targets the feature representation gaps between high-accuracy base models and lower-accuracy edge models. The mechanism leverages a structured subgraph extraction algorithm to identify critical components that, when added to the edge model, can bridge the accuracy gap. The key innovation lies in the objective function that simultaneously optimizes for both feature representation quality and complementarity, ensuring that the DELTA network enhances rather than duplicates existing capabilities. This approach allows for compact model compression while maintaining high accuracy, as the DELTA network focuses only on the most impactful features needed to close the performance gap between base and edge models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Model Compression Techniques**: Essential for understanding how to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy in resource-constrained environments. Needed to appreciate XDELTA's contribution to the state-of-the-art. Quick check: Verify that the DELTA network achieves significant parameter reduction compared to base models.
- **Explainable AI Methods**: Critical for understanding how XDELTA provides interpretable explanations of model differences. Needed to evaluate the quality and utility of geometric and concept-level analyses. Quick check: Confirm that explanations help users understand why edge models underperform base models.
- **Subgraph Extraction Algorithms**: Fundamental to XDELTA's approach for constructing the DELTA network. Needed to assess how effectively the algorithm identifies critical components. Quick check: Validate that extracted subgraphs contribute meaningfully to accuracy improvements.
- **Feature Representation Learning**: Central to understanding how the DELTA network complements edge models. Needed to evaluate the complementarity objective function's effectiveness. Quick check: Verify that the DELTA network captures features not adequately represented by the edge model.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Edge Network -> Feature Extraction -> Subgraph Extraction -> DELTA Network Construction -> Complementary Feature Integration -> Output Prediction

Critical Path:
The critical path involves the integration of the DELTA network with the edge network through complementary feature representation. This begins with the edge network's feature extraction, followed by subgraph extraction to identify missing or underrepresented features, then DELTA network construction to address these gaps, and finally the integration of complementary features to produce the final prediction.

Design Tradeoffs:
- **Compactness vs. Accuracy**: The DELTA network must be small enough for edge deployment while sufficiently powerful to improve accuracy
- **Complementarity vs. Redundancy**: The objective function must ensure the DELTA network adds new capabilities rather than duplicating existing features
- **Explanation Quality vs. Computational Overhead**: More detailed explanations require additional computation, which must be balanced for edge deployment

Failure Signatures:
- If the DELTA network is too large, it defeats the purpose of edge deployment
- If the objective function fails to ensure complementarity, the DELTA network may simply duplicate edge model capabilities
- If subgraph extraction misses critical components, the DELTA network won't effectively bridge the accuracy gap
- If explanations are too complex or computationally expensive, they won't be practical for edge scenarios

3 First Experiments:
1. Test XDELTA on a simple vision task (e.g., CIFAR10) with a small base model to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate the DELTA network's parameter count and FLOPS to verify computational efficiency claims
3. Assess explanation quality by having users compare geometric and concept-level analyses on sample predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the limitations section suggests areas for future research, including testing XDELTA on non-vision tasks and different model architectures to assess generalizability.

## Limitations
- The study focuses primarily on vision tasks with convolutional neural networks, leaving uncertainty about XDELTA's applicability to other model architectures or domains
- The human evaluation involves only six participants, which limits statistical power and generalizability of the real-world deployment results
- While claiming state-of-the-art performance in model compression, direct comparisons with other compression techniques are limited, making it difficult to definitively establish XDELTA's relative advantage

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale human study with diverse participants to validate XDELTA's practical utility and measure explanation quality using standardized interpretability metrics
2. Test XDELTA's effectiveness on non-vision tasks and different model architectures to assess generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual components (subgraph extraction, objective function) to overall performance
