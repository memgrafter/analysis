# Class Granularity: How richly does your knowledge graph represent the real world?

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces Class Granularity metric to measure ontological richness by quantifying unique predicates per subclass

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Class Granularity, a novel metric that measures how richly classes are defined in knowledge graphs by examining the uniqueness and usage of predicates across class hierarchies. Unlike existing metrics that focus on scale, coverage, or schema quality, Class Granularity specifically addresses whether subclasses have distinct predicates not defined for their superclasses and whether these predicates are actually used in instances. The metric reveals that knowledge graphs vary significantly in their ontological richness (0.09-0.40 across four LOD sources), providing insights beyond traditional scale-based comparisons. The authors demonstrate that higher granularity correlates with better entity clustering in graph embedding tasks, suggesting practical implications for knowledge graph applications.

## Method Summary
The Class Granularity metric is calculated by first identifying predicates that are uniquely defined for subclasses but not their superclasses. For each subclass, the metric computes the proportion of these unique predicates that are actually used in instances of that class. The final granularity score aggregates these proportions across all classes in the knowledge graph. The metric is designed to have minimum value 0 (when no class has unique predicates) and maximum value 1 (when every class has unique predicates fully utilized by instances). The authors validate the metric's properties and demonstrate its practical relevance by showing how granularity affects graph embedding performance, where higher granularity leads to better clustering of entities. The metric is applied to four LOD sources (DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, Wikidata) to reveal varying levels of ontological richness.

## Key Results
- Class Granularity scores across four LOD sources range from 0.09 to 0.40, revealing significant variation in ontological richness
- Higher granularity correlates with improved entity clustering in graph embedding tasks
- The metric successfully captures ontological depth beyond what scale-based metrics can measure
- Different LOD sources show distinct granularity patterns that align with their design philosophies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric works by quantifying the information content added at each level of the class hierarchy. When subclasses have predicates not present in their superclasses, they provide more specific and detailed representations of entities. By weighting these unique predicates by their actual usage in instances, the metric ensures that theoretical ontology richness translates into practical semantic distinction. This approach captures both the structural richness of the ontology and its practical utilization, making it more meaningful than metrics that only consider schema completeness or instance count.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graph Structure**: Understanding how classes, predicates, and instances relate in a hierarchical ontology - needed to grasp what constitutes ontological richness; quick check: can you identify superclass-subclass relationships in a given schema
- **LOD Sources**: Familiarity with DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, and Wikidata as major linked open data repositories - needed to contextualize the empirical results; quick check: know which source is Wikipedia-derived vs. collaboratively edited
- **Graph Embedding**: Understanding how entities are represented as vectors and how clustering relates to semantic similarity - needed to interpret the embedding performance results; quick check: can you explain why similar entities should cluster together in embedding space
- **Metric Validation**: Concepts of minimum/maximum values and interval scales in metric design - needed to assess the metric's mathematical properties; quick check: can you verify the metric satisfies the stated bounds

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Knowledge Graph Schema -> Class Hierarchy Analysis -> Predicate Uniqueness Detection -> Instance Usage Calculation -> Granularity Score

**Critical Path**: The metric computation follows a sequential path from schema analysis through to the final aggregated score, with instance usage calculation being the most computationally intensive step

**Design Tradeoffs**: The metric trades comprehensiveness for specificity - it focuses on predicate uniqueness rather than broader schema quality measures, making it more targeted but potentially missing other aspects of ontological richness

**Failure Signatures**: Low granularity scores could indicate either poor ontology design or simply appropriate use of inheritance (where subclasses genuinely don't need additional predicates), requiring careful interpretation

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Calculate granularity scores for a synthetic knowledge graph with known hierarchical relationships to validate metric behavior
2. Compare granularity against traditional metrics (instance count, predicate count) on the same knowledge graphs
3. Perform ablation studies removing either the uniqueness constraint or instance usage weighting to isolate their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The metric assumes that unique predicates indicate richness, which may not hold for all knowledge graph domains or use cases
- Limited validation to only four LOD sources raises questions about generalizability to domain-specific knowledge graphs
- The correlation between granularity and embedding performance doesn't establish causation - both could be influenced by data completeness
- The practical interpretation of intermediate granularity values (e.g., 0.2 vs 0.4) isn't fully contextualized

## Confidence
- Metric Theoretical Foundation: High - mathematical properties are clearly defined and proven
- Practical Applicability: Medium - limited empirical validation across diverse knowledge graph types
- Embedding Performance Claims: Medium - relationship needs more rigorous testing across different embedding methods
- Cross-Domain Generalizability: Medium - tested only on LOD sources, not domain-specific knowledge graphs

## Next Checks
1. Apply the Class Granularity metric to domain-specific knowledge graphs (medical, financial, scientific) to test its generalizability beyond LOD sources
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate which aspects of the metric (unique predicates vs instance usage) contribute most to the observed effects on embedding performance
3. Compare Class Granularity against human expert assessments of ontological quality to validate whether the metric captures meaningful aspects of knowledge representation that domain experts would consider important
