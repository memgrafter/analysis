# Human-Agent Coordination in Games under Incomplete Information via Multi-Step Intent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.18242
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18242
- Reference count: 32
- Human-agent user study shows 18.52% higher success rate than heuristic baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses coordination challenges in shared-control games with incomplete information by extending turn-based gameplay to allow multiple actions per turn and leveraging multi-step intent communication. The authors propose IntentMCTS, an online planning algorithm that combines a probabilistic belief module for modeling unknown partner dynamics with a multi-action Monte Carlo tree search enhanced by reward augmentation based on communicated intent. In both agent-agent simulations and human-agent user studies on the Gnomes at Night testbed, IntentMCTS significantly outperforms baseline heuristics, achieving higher success rates with fewer steps and reduced cognitive load.

## Method Summary
The approach extends a turn-based shared-control game to allow multiple actions per turn, enabling richer communication of multi-step intent. IntentMCTS integrates three key components: (1) a memory module maintaining Bayesian beliefs about the human partner's private transition function, updated dynamically using observed action histories; (2) a planning algorithm that uses multi-action Monte Carlo tree search to handle the expanded action space; and (3) reward augmentation that encourages following the human's communicated intent trajectory by adding discounted bonuses when visiting intent states. The algorithm balances exploration of unknown dynamics with exploitation of communicated intent to achieve efficient coordination in long-horizon tasks.

## Key Results
- IntentMCTS achieves over 99% success rate in agent-agent simulations, outperforming heuristic baseline (88%)
- In human-agent user study, IntentMCTS achieves 18.52% higher success rate than baseline and 5.56% higher than single-step intent MCTS
- Participants report lower cognitive load, frustration, and higher satisfaction with IntentMCTS compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reward augmentation with multi-step intent improves coordination by providing denser, task-relevant reward signals.
- Mechanism: When the agent visits a state in the human's communicated intent trajectory, it receives a discounted bonus. This encourages the agent to follow the human's intended path rather than finding its own, which reduces coordination friction in long-horizon tasks.
- Core assumption: The communicated intent reflects the human's desired path and is aligned with task success.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "IntentMCTS integrates multi-step intent by augmenting the environment reward with a bonus when a transition lands in a desired state included in the intent."
  - [section 4.2]: "IntentMCTS performs reward augmentation to encourage the agent to follow the partner's intent trajectory."
- Break condition: If the human's intent is misleading, noisy, or misaligned with optimal task completion, the agent may follow suboptimal paths.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The probabilistic belief module improves coordination by reducing uncertainty about the human's private transition function.
- Mechanism: The agent maintains a Bayesian belief over the existence of each state-action transition in the human's maze. This belief is updated using weighted positive and negative evidence from the human's observed actions, with higher confidence in positive evidence (actual transitions seen) than negative evidence (non-attempted transitions).
- Core assumption: The human's action history provides reliable signals about their private maze structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This approach features a memory module for a running probabilistic belief of the environment dynamics."
  - [section 4.1]: "The belief is initialized uniformly and updated dynamically during gameplay as new evidence is gathered from the partner's movement history."
- Break condition: If the human's behavior is highly stochastic or deceptive, the belief may converge incorrectly, leading to poor coordination.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-action turns enable richer strategic coordination than single-action turns by allowing complex, multi-step intents.
- Mechanism: By allowing both players to take multiple actions per turn, the agent can communicate and act on variable-length intent sequences, enabling planning over longer horizons and more sophisticated coordination strategies.
- Core assumption: Multi-step intents are more expressive and useful than single-step intents for complex tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The extension enables the use of multi-step intent, which we hypothesize will improve performance in long-horizon tasks."
  - [section 2]: "This extension enables the agent to leverage multi-step intent, which was previously unattainable due to the limitation of single-action turns."
- Break condition: If the game is simple or short-horizon, the overhead of multi-step planning may not justify the benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian belief updating with asymmetric evidence weighting
  - Why needed here: To maintain a probabilistic model of the human's private maze structure based on observed actions.
  - Quick check question: Why is positive evidence (seen transitions) weighted more heavily than negative evidence (non-attempted transitions) in the belief update?

- Concept: Monte Carlo Tree Search with reward augmentation
  - Why needed here: To plan multi-step actions that incorporate both the environment reward and the human's communicated intent.
  - Quick check question: How does reward augmentation differ from reward shaping in terms of information source and task dependency?

- Concept: Multi-action game tree expansion
  - Why needed here: To model the possibility of taking multiple actions per turn in the search tree.
  - Quick check question: How does the branching factor change when allowing multiple actions per turn versus single actions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Memory Module -> IntentMCTS Planner -> Game Interface -> Belief Update Engine
- Critical path:
  1. Receive human action history
  2. Update belief using Algorithm 1
  3. Generate multi-step intent (shortest path to goal given current belief)
  4. Run IntentMCTS (Algorithm 2) with intent-augmented reward
  5. Execute chosen action(s)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Belief update speed vs. accuracy: Faster updates may use simpler heuristics; slower updates use full Bayesian inference.
  - Intent length vs. coordination benefit: Longer intents provide more guidance but may be harder to follow.
  - Exploration constant in MCTS vs. exploitation: Higher values explore more but may slow convergence.

- Failure signatures:
  - Belief stagnation: Belief values stop changing despite new evidence (check update rule).
  - Intent misalignment: Agent follows human's intent but fails to reach goal (check intent generation logic).
  - Tree growth explosion: MCTS takes too long (check action space pruning or depth limits).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run agent-agent simulation with fixed maze and measure success rate vs. baseline.
  2. Vary intent discount factor λ and measure impact on steps and control switches.
  3. Test belief update with synthetic human that reveals walls gradually; measure belief accuracy over time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of IntentMCTS scale with the complexity of the maze layouts and the length of the multi-step intent trajectories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the heuristic controller struggles in more complex configurations and that IntentMCTS requires fewer steps and control switches. However, it does not provide detailed performance metrics across varying levels of maze complexity or intent trajectory lengths.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides performance data for a limited set of maze configurations and does not explore the impact of varying maze complexity or intent trajectory lengths on the algorithm's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the success rate, steps taken, and control switches for IntentMCTS across a range of maze complexities and intent trajectory lengths would clarify its scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the confidence factor (𝑐+) in the belief update mechanism affect the agent's ability to infer the human partner's dynamics accurately?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the belief update incorporates positive and negative evidence with different confidence factors, but it does not explore the impact of varying these confidence factors on the accuracy of the inferred dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the confidence factors influence the belief update process or the agent's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the confidence factors and measuring the accuracy of the inferred dynamics and the resulting coordination performance would clarify their impact.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the intent discount factor (𝜆) influence the trade-off between following the intent trajectory and finding a shorter path to the goal?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the intent discount factor and its role in balancing intent trajectory following and final intent state reaching, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of its impact on the agent's behavior.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how different values of the intent discount factor affect the agent's decision-making and overall performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the intent discount factor and measuring the agent's tendency to follow the intent trajectory versus finding shorter paths would clarify its influence on behavior.

## Limitations
- Performance evaluated only on specific game testbed (Gnomes at Night) with simple state spaces
- Belief update assumes reliable observation of human actions, may fail with partial observability
- Reward augmentation depends on assumption that human's communicated intent is aligned with task success

## Confidence
- Agent-agent simulation results: Medium-High (controlled conditions, clear baseline comparisons)
- Human-agent study results: Medium (small sample size N=18, potential behavioral confounds)
- Cognitive benefit claims: Medium (self-reported measures without objective validation)

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization test**: Evaluate IntentMCTS on a different turn-based coordination game with larger state spaces and more complex dynamics to verify performance scaling.

2. **Robustness to intent misalignment**: Test the system when the human communicates suboptimal or adversarial intents to quantify the impact on coordination success.

3. **Ablation of belief module**: Run controlled experiments disabling the belief update component to measure its marginal contribution to performance gains.
