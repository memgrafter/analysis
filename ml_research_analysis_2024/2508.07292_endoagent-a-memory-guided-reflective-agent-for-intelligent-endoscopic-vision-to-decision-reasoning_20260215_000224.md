# EndoAgent: A Memory-Guided Reflective Agent for Intelligent Endoscopic Vision-to-Decision Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07292
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07292
- Authors: Yi Tang; Kaini Wang; Yang Chen; Guangquan Zhou
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: EndoAgent achieves 84.97% accuracy on visual tasks and 97.83% relative score on language tasks, outperforming both general-purpose and medical multimodal models

## Executive Summary
EndoAgent introduces a memory-guided reflective agent for endoscopic vision-to-decision reasoning that addresses the limitations of general-purpose multimodal models in clinical settings. The key innovation is a dual-memory architecture combining short-term action tracking and long-term experiential learning to enable iterative refinement of clinical decisions through multi-round reasoning. By integrating six expert-designed tools for classification, detection, segmentation, image editing, visual question answering, and report generation, EndoAgent achieves superior performance on complex diagnostic tasks. The system demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches, with comprehensive evaluation on a newly created benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs across five diagnostic tasks.

## Method Summary
EndoAgent is built on a dual-memory architecture where short-term memory tracks tool actions and outputs for context maintenance, while long-term memory accumulates reflective feedback for experiential learning. The agent operates through iterative reasoning cycles, selecting from a suite of six expert-designed tools tailored for specific endoscopic tasks. Each cycle involves tool selection, invocation, memory updating, reflection generation, and context updating, with a completion check determining when to return the final output. The system is evaluated on EndoAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark created specifically for this work, using both visual task accuracy and language task relative scores across seven clinical dimensions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.97% accuracy on visual tasks compared to 72.57% for GPT-4o and 71.35% for Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Scores 97.83% relative score on language tasks, outperforming both general-purpose and medical multimodal models
- Demonstrates superior flexibility and reasoning capabilities in endoscopic analysis through systematic ablation studies and error analysis
- Shows consistent performance improvements across five diagnostic tasks: lesion classification, detection, segmentation, image editing, and report generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dual-memory architecture enables EndoAgent to progressively refine clinical decisions through iterative reasoning cycles.
- Mechanism: Short-term memory records tool actions and outputs for context maintenance and error avoidance, while long-term memory accumulates reflective feedback (error analysis, optimization suggestions, distilled experience) to guide future tool selection and reasoning strategies.
- Core assumption: Clinical decision-making benefits from both immediate action tracking and accumulated experiential learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning."
  - [section] "EndoAgent incorporates a dual-memory mechanism that guides accumulated experience from previous reasoning steps to inform subsequent actions through short-term and long-term memory components."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - no direct matches for dual-memory mechanism in related papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-round reflection framework improves diagnostic accuracy by systematically verifying and refining initial tool outputs.
- Mechanism: EndoAgent iteratively invokes tools, generates reflective feedback about errors or uncertainties, and uses this feedback to trigger secondary verification steps, as demonstrated in the lesion quantification case where initial detection was refined through segmentation.
- Core assumption: Clinical experts engage in holistic reasoning by synthesizing multiple sources of evidence rather than relying on single analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration"
  - [section] "In each round, EndoAgent analyzes the task context, selects an expert tool, and stores the action and output in short-term memory... generates reflective feedback by summarizing errors or uncertainties"
  - [corpus] Moderate corpus evidence - several papers discuss reflective agents and multi-round reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Expert-designed specialized tools working in coordination provide superior performance compared to general-purpose multimodal models.
- Mechanism: EndoAgent integrates six task-specific expert tools (classification, detection, segmentation, image editing, VQA, report generation) that operate in synergy, with each tool handling its domain of expertise and outputs being synthesized by the central LLM.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific expert tools can achieve higher accuracy than general models when properly coordinated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop"
  - [section] "EndoAgent integrates a suite of endoscopic tools including six advanced models, each tailored for a specific task"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - related papers focus on general agent frameworks rather than specialized medical tool suites.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dual-memory architectures in AI systems
  - Why needed here: EndoAgent requires both immediate context tracking and long-term experiential learning to mimic clinical reasoning workflows
  - Quick check question: What are the two key functions served by short-term versus long-term memory in EndoAgent's design?

- Concept: Multi-round iterative reasoning in decision systems
  - Why needed here: Single-step analysis is insufficient for complex clinical workflows requiring verification and refinement of initial outputs
  - Quick check question: How does EndoAgent determine when to stop iterative reflection and return a final diagnostic result?

- Concept: Expert system tool integration and coordination
  - Why needed here: EndoAgent must coordinate multiple specialized tools to handle the full spectrum of endoscopic diagnostic tasks
  - Quick check question: What mechanism ensures EndoAgent selects the most appropriate tool for each reasoning round?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Actor module (LLM core) -> Evaluator module -> Self-Reflection module -> Short-term memory (Ms) -> Long-term memory (Ml) -> Expert toolset -> Context management system

- Critical path: Query → Context initialization → Tool selection → Tool invocation → Memory update → Reflection generation → Context update → Completion check → Final output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Reflection rounds vs. computational efficiency (optimal at 3 rounds)
  - Specialized tool accuracy vs. integration complexity
  - Memory size vs. reasoning quality (larger memories may improve accuracy but increase latency)
  - LLM choice vs. framework flexibility (current design supports multiple MLLMs)

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation with excessive reflection rounds (4+)
  - Tool selection errors when context is poorly maintained
  - Memory corruption leading to inconsistent reasoning
  - Integration failures when expert tools produce incompatible outputs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study removing reflection mechanism to measure its impact on visual task accuracy
  2. Testing with different maximum reflection round counts (1, 2, 3, 4) to find optimal iteration depth
  3. Swapping core LLM (GPT-4o → Gemini 2.5 Pro → Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to validate framework scalability across models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the dual-memory mechanism in EndoAgent specifically improve diagnostic accuracy compared to single-step agents in complex endoscopic scenarios?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses the dual-memory design combining short-term action tracking and long-term experiential learning to enable iterative refinement of clinical decisions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows improved performance, it does not provide detailed comparative analysis of the dual-memory mechanism's specific contributions versus other architectural approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed ablation studies comparing EndoAgent's performance with and without the dual-memory mechanism, and against other memory architectures in similar clinical tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can EndoAgent's modular architecture be extended to other medical imaging domains beyond endoscopy, and what would be the performance implications?
- Basis in paper: Inferred - The paper mentions the modular architecture supports plug-and-play scalability across different large language models, suggesting potential for extension.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses exclusively on endoscopic applications without exploring cross-domain applicability or performance benchmarks in other medical imaging contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating EndoAgent's performance when adapted to other medical imaging domains like radiology or pathology, with comparative analysis against domain-specific models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational resource requirements for EndoAgent in real-time clinical deployment, and how does this impact practical usability?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions hardware specifications (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU) but does not discuss real-time deployment constraints or resource efficiency.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates technical feasibility, it does not address practical deployment considerations such as latency, power consumption, or hardware requirements for clinical settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks measuring inference time, memory usage, and power consumption under different deployment scenarios, along with cost-benefit analysis for clinical implementation.

## Limitations

- The EndoAgentBench dataset, while comprehensive at 5,709 samples, may not fully capture the diversity of real-world endoscopic scenarios, particularly rare pathologies or unusual anatomical variations.
- The evaluation relies on a single automated Qwen-VL-Plus evaluator for language tasks, which may introduce evaluator-specific biases not reflective of human clinical judgment.
- The performance advantage over general-purpose models needs validation on external datasets beyond those used in training or development.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The dual-memory architecture design and its core mechanism for tracking tool actions and accumulating experiential learning
- Medium confidence: The superiority of specialized expert tools over general-purpose models
- Medium confidence: The optimal reflection depth of three rounds

## Next Checks

1. **External dataset validation**: Evaluate EndoAgent on completely independent endoscopic datasets not used in any training or development phase to verify generalization beyond the EndoAgentBench benchmark.

2. **Human expert evaluation**: Conduct blinded comparison studies where experienced endoscopists rate EndoAgent's outputs against those from general-purpose models and human specialists across the seven clinical dimensions measured in the language task evaluation.

3. **Robustness testing**: Systematically test EndoAgent's performance with corrupted or adversarial inputs, including low-quality images, unusual lighting conditions, and rare pathologies, to assess real-world reliability and identify failure modes not captured in controlled benchmarking.
