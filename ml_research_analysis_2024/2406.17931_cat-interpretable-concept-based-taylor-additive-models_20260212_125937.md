# CAT: Interpretable Concept-based Taylor Additive Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.17931
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17931
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: CAT achieves competitive accuracy with fewer parameters while providing clear, concept-level explanations

## Executive Summary
CAT introduces an interpretable concept-based Taylor additive model that explains predictions through high-level concepts without requiring extensive expert labeling. The method groups input features into concepts, embeds them via neural encoders, and applies a white-box Taylor neural network with Tucker decomposition to capture non-linear relationships efficiently. Experiments on six benchmarks show CAT achieves competitive or better accuracy than baselines while using fewer model parameters. It also provides clear, concept-level explanations of model decisions, demonstrating both strong predictive performance and interpretability.

## Method Summary
CAT combines concept-based modeling with Taylor polynomial approximation to create an interpretable machine learning model. The approach involves three main components: (1) grouping raw features into meaningful concepts, (2) encoding these concepts using neural networks, and (3) applying a TaylorNet with Tucker decomposition to model non-linear relationships. The Tucker decomposition reduces computational complexity while maintaining interpretability. The model is trained using AdamW optimizer with early stopping, and can handle both regression and classification tasks across tabular and image datasets.

## Key Results
- CAT achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to baselines on six benchmark datasets
- The model uses fewer parameters than comparison methods while maintaining performance
- Provides clear, concept-level explanations of model decisions through its additive structure
- Demonstrates effectiveness on both tabular data (Airbnb, COMPAS, Diabetes, UCI-HAR) and image datasets (MNIST, CelebA)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CAT works by bridging the gap between complex neural networks and interpretable models. By grouping features into high-level concepts, it reduces the dimensionality of inputs while preserving semantic meaning. The Taylor polynomial approximation captures non-linear relationships in a mathematically tractable way, and the Tucker decomposition makes higher-order polynomials computationally feasible. This combination allows CAT to model complex relationships while maintaining interpretability through its additive structure and concept-level explanations.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept Encoding**
- Why needed: Transforms raw features into meaningful, high-level representations
- Quick check: Verify that encoded concepts capture relevant variance in target variable

**Taylor Polynomial Approximation**
- Why needed: Provides a white-box way to model non-linear relationships
- Quick check: Confirm that polynomial order matches data complexity

**Tucker Decomposition**
- Why needed: Reduces computational complexity of higher-order polynomials
- Quick check: Verify rank reduction maintains prediction accuracy

**Concept Grouping Strategy**
- Why needed: Determines the semantic level of interpretability
- Quick check: Assess concept coherence and relevance to target

**Additive Structure**
- Why needed: Enables clear attribution of predictions to individual concepts
- Quick check: Verify that individual concept contributions sum to total prediction

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Concept Groupings -> Concept Encoders -> TaylorNet (with Tucker Decomposition) -> Predictions

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves: (1) feature grouping into concepts, (2) concept encoding via MLPs, (3) Taylor polynomial expansion with Tucker decomposition, and (4) prediction generation. Each component builds on the previous one, with the concept grouping determining the interpretability level, the encoders learning concept representations, and the TaylorNet capturing non-linear relationships efficiently.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Higher polynomial order increases expressiveness but also computational cost and potential overfitting
- Larger Tucker decomposition ranks improve approximation accuracy but reduce parameter efficiency
- More granular concept groupings increase interpretability but may require more expert knowledge
- Deeper concept encoders can capture complex relationships but reduce transparency

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor concept groupings leading to low predictive performance
- Overfitting with high-order polynomials (indicated by large gap between train and validation performance)
- Insufficient Tucker decomposition rank causing loss of important non-linear relationships
- Concept encoders failing to capture relevant feature interactions

**Three First Experiments**
1. Test different concept grouping strategies on a simple dataset to assess impact on interpretability and performance
2. Compare TaylorNet performance with different polynomial orders (2 vs 3) on a validation set
3. Evaluate the effect of Tucker decomposition rank on both prediction accuracy and model size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the choice of feature grouping into concepts affect the model's predictive performance and interpretability in CAT?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed CAT simplifies the concept labeling process by requiring users to simply categorize input features into broad groups, which can be easily accomplished through a quick metadata review. It also states that the ease of interpretation for CAT models results from the combination of the compact high-level concept inputs and TaylorNet's inherent interpretability.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper suggests that feature grouping into concepts is straightforward with meaningful feature names and metadata, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how different feature grouping strategies might impact the model's performance and interpretability. The paper does not explore the sensitivity of CAT to different feature grouping choices or the potential trade-offs involved.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with various feature grouping strategies and comparing their impact on CAT's predictive performance and interpretability would help address this question. Analyzing the model's sensitivity to different feature groupings and identifying the optimal grouping strategy for different datasets would provide valuable insights.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the use of Tucker decomposition in TaylorNet impact the model's scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale datasets?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that Tucker decomposition is employed to reduce the computational complexity of TaylorNet by decomposing the higher-order coefficients in Taylor expansion into a set of low-rank tensors. It states that using Tucker decomposition results in a substantial reduction in the number of parameters and improves the training time of TaylorNet.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper highlights the benefits of using Tucker decomposition in TaylorNet, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of its impact on the model's scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale datasets. The paper does not explore the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and computational requirements as the dataset size increases.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with large-scale datasets and comparing the computational requirements and performance of CAT with and without Tucker decomposition would help address this question. Analyzing the model's scalability and identifying the optimal decomposition rank for different dataset sizes would provide valuable insights.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the choice of polynomial order in TaylorNet affect the model's ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and its interpretability?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that TaylorNet aims to learn the non-linear relationship between the inputs and outputs using polynomials. It states that Taylor polynomials of higher order produce more precise approximations but also increase computational complexity. The paper conducts experiments with different polynomial orders (2 and 3) and discusses their impact on prediction performance.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper explores the impact of polynomial order on prediction performance, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how the choice of polynomial order affects the model's ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and its interpretability. The paper does not investigate the trade-offs between model expressiveness, interpretability, and computational requirements for different polynomial orders.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with different polynomial orders and analyzing their impact on the model's ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and its interpretability would help address this question. Investigating the trade-offs between model expressiveness, interpretability, and computational requirements for different polynomial orders would provide valuable insights.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset diversity with relatively small benchmarks that may not represent real-world complexity
- Heavy dependency on quality of concept groupings which are not fully specified for all datasets
- Partial specification of Tucker decomposition parameters affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core methodology of using concept encoders with TaylorNet and Tucker decomposition is clearly described and theoretically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: The reported performance metrics on the tested benchmarks, as the exact experimental conditions and hyperparameters are not fully specified.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion**: Test CAT on larger, more diverse datasets (e.g., ImageNet, large-scale tabular data) to assess scalability and performance in more complex scenarios.

2. **Concept Robustness Analysis**: Systematically evaluate how different concept groupings affect both performance and interpretability, including automated concept discovery methods versus manual expert labeling.

3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art**: Conduct head-to-head comparisons with the latest interpretable models on both tabular and image data, focusing on both accuracy and interpretability metrics.
