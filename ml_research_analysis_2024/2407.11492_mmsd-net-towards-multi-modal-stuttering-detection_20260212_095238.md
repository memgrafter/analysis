# MMSD-Net: Towards Multi-modal Stuttering Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11492
- Reference count: 0
- Multi-modal stuttering detection achieves 2-17% higher F1-scores than uni-modal methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MMSD-Net, the first multi-modal neural framework for stuttering detection that combines audio, video, and text inputs. The method employs specialized modality encoders and a fusion module based on attention mechanisms to detect stuttered speech. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that incorporating visual cues alongside audio and text significantly improves detection performance, achieving 2-17% higher F1-scores compared to state-of-the-art uni-modal approaches.

## Method Summary
MMSD-Net uses three parallel transformer encoders to process video, audio, and text inputs separately, followed by a Q-Former-based fusion module that aligns and combines these representations through attention mechanisms. The model is trained using LoRA optimization on 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs with batch size of 4, 10 epochs, and FP16 precision. The architecture is designed to capture stuttering indicators from facial expressions alongside audio patterns and linguistic features.

## Key Results
- MMSD-Net achieves 2-17% higher F1-scores than four state-of-the-art uni-modal methods
- Visual cues significantly improve stuttering detection performance when combined with audio and text
- Multi-modal approach demonstrates effectiveness for automatic stutter detection across multiple datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Multi-modal fusion improves stuttering detection by integrating complementary visual cues with audio and text features
- Specialized modality encoders extract features from video, audio, and text, then a Q-Former-based fusion module aligns and combines these through attention mechanisms
- Assumes visual cues from facial expressions during stuttering provide information that audio alone cannot capture
- Evidence: 2-17% F1-score improvement over uni-modal approaches; stuttering cues found in visual signal

### Mechanism 2
- Transformer-based encoders capture long-range dependencies better than traditional CNNs or LSTMs
- Three separate transformer encoders process each modality, capturing complex temporal patterns in speech disfluencies
- Assumes stuttering events involve long-range dependencies requiring global attention capabilities
- Evidence: Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies; positional encodings enable sequence modeling

### Mechanism 3
- LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models for stuttering detection
- LoRA optimization uses 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs with batch size of 4 and gradient accumulation for 5 steps
- Assumes pre-trained language models contain transferable representations that can be efficiently adapted
- Evidence: LoRA cited as optimization method; specific training configuration details provided

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-modal representation learning
  - Why needed here: Model must learn to extract and fuse features from three different modalities into unified representation space
  - Quick check question: How does Q-Former attention mechanism ensure visual features are properly aligned with audio and text features?

- Concept: Stuttering event patterns and disfluencies
  - Why needed here: Understanding different types of stuttering (blocks, repetitions, prolongations) and their acoustic/visual signatures
  - Quick check question: What are key acoustic and visual differences between stuttering block and normal speech pauses?

- Concept: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Core of MMSD-Net relies on transformer encoders and multi-head attention for modality encoding and fusion
  - Quick check question: How do positional encodings in transformers help capture temporal sequence of stuttering events?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video/Audio/Text → Modality Encoders → Fusion Module → Multimodal LLM → Classification
- Critical path: Three parallel streams (video, audio, text) processed by separate transformer encoders, then fused via Q-Former attention mechanism, processed by multimodal LLM, and classified as stuttered vs non-stuttered
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Transformers vs CNNs: Higher computational cost but better long-range dependency capture
  - Multi-modal vs uni-modal: Increased data requirements and complexity but better performance
  - Pre-training vs from-scratch: Faster convergence and better generalization but potential domain mismatch
- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision but high recall: Model over-sensitive to stuttering cues
  - High precision but low recall: Model misses actual stuttering events
  - Poor performance on specific speaker types: Insufficient diversity in training data
  - Failure on low-quality video: Visual modality critical for performance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Remove visual modality and measure performance drop to quantify visual contribution
  2. Cross-dataset validation: Test on unseen datasets to evaluate generalization
  3. Modality importance ranking: Use attention weights to determine which modality contributes most to detection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MMSD-Net perform on detecting different types of stuttering disfluencies (repetition, prolongation, block) separately?
- Basis in paper: Paper mentions various stuttering types but evaluates only on binary detection
- Why unresolved: Focuses on overall stuttering detection without analyzing performance on specific disfluency types
- What evidence would resolve it: Results showing precision, recall, and F1-scores for each stuttering type as multi-class classification

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well does MMSD-Net generalize to speakers with different accents, ages, and genders not represented in training data?
- Basis in paper: Uses limited datasets (Adults Who Stutter with 200 training samples) without addressing cross-speaker generalization
- Why unresolved: Uses relatively small, specific datasets without evaluating performance across diverse speaker populations
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-validation results across different speaker demographics and performance metrics on diverse speakers

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different fusion strategies (early vs late fusion) on MMSD-Net's performance?
- Basis in paper: Mentions using Q-Former-based fusion but doesn't compare against alternative fusion strategies
- Why unresolved: Presents only one fusion approach without exploring or comparing alternative multimodal fusion strategies
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results showing performance using different fusion strategies with F1-scores and computational efficiency metrics

## Limitations

- Lack of direct comparison with other multi-modal stuttering detection methods since MMSD-Net is the first such approach
- Visual modality effectiveness may be constrained by lighting conditions, camera quality, and speaker positioning
- Model requires synchronized audio, video, and text data, limiting deployment in scenarios where synchronization is difficult

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Multi-modal fusion improves stuttering detection (2-17% F1-score improvement over uni-modal methods)
- Medium Confidence: Transformer-based encoders capture long-range dependencies better than traditional architectures
- Medium Confidence: LoRA effectiveness for efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing each modality to quantify specific contribution of visual cues versus audio and text features, particularly examining performance across different lighting conditions
2. Test the model on out-of-domain datasets or with degraded visual inputs to assess robustness and determine minimum visual quality required for reliable performance
3. Implement and compare against baseline multi-modal architecture using traditional feature extractors (CNNs for video, RNNs for audio) to isolate impact of transformer architectures versus multi-modal fusion itself
