# ASPIRE: Assistive System for Performance Evaluation in IR

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15759
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15759
- Authors: Georgios Peikos; Wojciech Kusa; Symeon Symeonidis
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: ASPIRE is a web-based visual analytics tool for in-depth analysis of Information Retrieval experiment results.

## Executive Summary
ASPIRE is a web-based visual analytics tool designed to enable comprehensive evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) experiment results beyond simple performance measures. The tool addresses the need for deeper analysis by supporting four key aspects: single/multi-experiment comparisons, query-level analysis, query characteristics-performance interplay, and collection-based retrieval analysis. Built with Python and Streamlit, ASPIRE accepts standard TREC-style files and provides interactive visualizations, statistical significance testing, and exportable results in multiple formats. The tool aims to complement existing IR run repositories by offering researchers the ability to gain deeper insights into system performance through features like precision-recall curves, query similarity visualizations, and relevance judgment distribution analysis.

## Method Summary
ASPIRE is implemented in Python using Streamlit for the interactive web interface, ir_measures for evaluation metrics, statistics and statsmodels for statistical analysis, plotly-express for visualization, and transformers library for query performance evaluation. The tool accepts standard TREC-style input files including query files, qrels files, and TREC-style run files. It provides a modular architecture organized into multiple web pages for different analysis aspects, with real-time parameter adjustments and immediate visual feedback. The system includes file validation, metric calculation, visualization generation, statistical analysis, and results export capabilities.

## Key Results
- Supports four key IR evaluation aspects: single/multi-experiment comparisons, query-level analysis, query characteristics-performance interplay, and collection-based retrieval analysis
- Provides interactive visualizations including precision-recall curves, query similarity plots, and relevance judgment distributions
- Includes statistical significance testing and supports exportable results in PNG, CSV, and PDF formats
- Built to handle large collections and evaluate numerous runs simultaneously, complementing existing IR run repositories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ASPIRE improves IR evaluation depth by combining interactive visualizations with statistical analysis tools.
- Mechanism: The tool provides multiple visualization types alongside statistical significance testing, allowing researchers to identify patterns and differences that raw performance scores would miss.
- Core assumption: Visual representations of IR performance data reveal insights about system behavior that are not apparent from numerical metrics alone.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ASPIRE supports four key aspects of IR experiment evaluation and analysis" and [section] "Visual analytics can aid researchers conduct these in-depth analyses"
- Break condition: If users lack statistical literacy to interpret significance tests or if visualizations become too complex to navigate effectively

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ASPIRE enables reproducibility and transparency in IR research by providing a standardized evaluation framework.
- Mechanism: By accepting standard TREC-style files and providing exportable results in multiple formats, ASPIRE creates a consistent workflow for evaluating and sharing IR experiment results.
- Core assumption: Standardized evaluation formats and reproducible analysis workflows are essential for advancing IR research through meaningful comparisons.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ASPIRE accepts standard TREC-style files and provides interactive visualizations, statistical significance testing, and exportable results"
- Break condition: If the tool cannot handle non-standard evaluation scenarios or if export formats become incompatible with other research tools

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ASPIRE reduces the cognitive load of IR evaluation by providing an intuitive, web-based interface.
- Mechanism: The Streamlit-powered interface organizes complex evaluation tasks into clearly defined sections and pages, with real-time parameter adjustments and immediate visual feedback.
- Core assumption: A well-organized, interactive interface significantly reduces the time and expertise required to perform sophisticated IR evaluations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ASPIRE is developed in Python, with streamlit (v1.37.0) powering its interactive web interface"
- Break condition: If the interface becomes too complex with added features or if web-based deployment creates performance bottlenecks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information Retrieval Evaluation Metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding precision, recall, F1, NDCG, and other IR metrics is essential for interpreting ASPIRE's analysis outputs
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between precision at rank k and mean average precision?

- Concept: Statistical Significance Testing
  - Why needed here: ASPIRE performs statistical tests to determine if performance differences between runs are meaningful
  - Quick check question: When would you use a paired t-test versus a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for comparing IR runs?

- Concept: Visual Analytics Principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to interpret and create effective visualizations is crucial for leveraging ASPIRE's interactive plots
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when choosing between a precision-recall curve and a ROC curve for IR evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Streamlit frontend -> Python backend -> ir_measures for metrics -> statistics/statsmodels for analysis -> plotly-express for visualization -> transformers for query processing -> File validation utilities
- Critical path: File upload → Validation → Metric calculation → Visualization → Statistical analysis → Export results
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Web-based interface enables accessibility but may limit processing speed for very large datasets
  - Modular architecture supports extensibility but increases complexity
  - Interactive visualizations enhance exploration but require more computational resources
  - Multiple export formats support different workflows but increase maintenance overhead
- Failure signatures:
  - Empty visualizations: likely indicates input file format issues or missing data
  - Slow response times: may indicate large dataset processing bottlenecks
  - Incorrect metrics: suggests calculation or file parsing errors
  - Broken interactive features: points to frontend-backend communication issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Upload a simple TREC-style run file with one query and verify basic metrics display correctly
  2. Upload multiple run files and test multi-run comparison visualizations
  3. Test query-level analysis by uploading a run file with varying query performance and verify the query breakdown displays as expected

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ASPIRE's performance scale when analyzing hundreds of IR runs simultaneously compared to existing tools?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states ASPIRE is "built to handle large collections and evaluate numerous runs simultaneously"
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions scalability capabilities but doesn't provide empirical data comparing ASPIRE's performance with other tools
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results showing ASPIRE's processing time, memory usage, and response times when analyzing different numbers of runs (10, 50, 100, 500) compared to tools like trec_eval, ranx, and Vis-Trec

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of ASPIRE's visual analytics features on researchers' ability to identify meaningful patterns in IR experiment results compared to traditional statistical analysis alone?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes ASPIRE's visual analytics capabilities but doesn't provide user studies or empirical evidence of its effectiveness
- Why unresolved: While the paper describes the tool's features, it doesn't validate whether these visualizations actually lead to better insights or more efficient analysis
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing analysis outcomes, time to insight, and pattern identification accuracy between researchers using ASPIRE versus traditional statistical analysis methods

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the integration of query similarity analysis using transformer models affect the accuracy of query performance prediction in ASPIRE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "transformers library is used for query performance evaluation w.r.t. to contextually similar queries"
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this feature is planned but doesn't provide details on which transformer models are used or their effectiveness
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis showing the accuracy of query performance predictions using ASPIRE's transformer-based approach versus traditional methods, including metrics like correlation coefficients and error rates

## Limitations
- Lacks systematic usability studies or empirical comparisons with existing evaluation tools
- No quantitative metrics on performance overhead or scalability testing with very large collections
- Tool's handling of edge cases, error conditions, and non-standard evaluation scenarios remains undocumented
- Evaluation relies entirely on anecdotal user feedback rather than controlled studies

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Visual analytics improving depth): Medium confidence - supported by domain principles but lacks empirical validation
- Mechanism 2 (Standardization enabling reproducibility): High confidence - directly demonstrated through file format specifications and export capabilities
- Mechanism 3 (Interface reducing cognitive load): Low confidence - claimed but not empirically tested with users

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled usability study comparing IR researchers' efficiency and insight generation when using ASPIRE versus traditional evaluation methods
2. Perform systematic scalability testing with collections ranging from small (<1K documents) to large (>1M documents) to identify performance bottlenecks
3. Validate the statistical significance testing module by creating synthetic datasets with known differences and measuring false positive/negative rates
