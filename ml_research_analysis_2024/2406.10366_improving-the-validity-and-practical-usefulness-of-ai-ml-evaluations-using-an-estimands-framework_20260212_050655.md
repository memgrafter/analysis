# Improving the Validity and Practical Usefulness of AI/ML Evaluations Using an Estimands Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10366
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10366
- Authors: Olivier Binette; Jerome P. Reiter
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: Addresses unreliable AI/ML model evaluations that can lead to incorrect model rankings due to poorly defined evaluation targets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical problem in machine learning evaluation: unreliable model comparisons that can lead to incorrect rankings and rank reversals. The authors propose adapting an estimands framework from clinical trials to machine learning evaluation, providing a structured approach to align evaluation objectives with methodology. The framework emphasizes defining a clear estimand (estimation target) through four components: scope/population, data acquisition/handling, metric, and aggregation. Through examples of cross-validation, clustering evaluation, and LLM benchmarking, the paper demonstrates how this framework can identify causes of rank reversals and suggest better evaluation approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors adapt the estimands framework from clinical trials to ML evaluation, providing a structured approach to define what exactly is being estimated in an evaluation. The framework consists of four components: (1) scope/population - defining the target population and context, (2) data acquisition/handling - specifying how data is collected and processed, (3) metric - choosing appropriate performance measures, and (4) aggregation - determining how results are combined. The paper applies this framework to analyze common evaluation methodologies, demonstrating how poorly defined estimands can lead to rank reversals and suggesting improvements through better specification of evaluation targets.

## Key Results
- Common evaluation methodologies can lead to high probability of rank reversals even with large performance differences between models
- The estimands framework helps identify causes of rank reversals in cross-validation, clustering evaluation, and LLM benchmarking
- Better specification of evaluation targets through the four-component framework can improve evaluation validity and prevent misleading comparisons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The estimands framework works by forcing explicit specification of what is being estimated in an evaluation, preventing the ambiguity that leads to rank reversals. By clearly defining the scope, data handling, metrics, and aggregation methods, evaluators can ensure their methodology actually targets what they intend to measure. This prevents mismatches between evaluation objectives and methodology that commonly cause unreliable comparisons.

## Foundational Learning
- **Estimands concept**: Why needed - provides clear definition of what is being estimated; Quick check - can you articulate the target population and context?
- **Rank reversals**: Why needed - understanding when model rankings become unreliable; Quick check - have you tested your evaluation methodology for sensitivity to data sampling?
- **Cross-validation methodology**: Why needed - common source of evaluation problems; Quick check - does your CV strategy match your intended evaluation scope?
- **Evaluation metric selection**: Why needed - metrics must align with evaluation objectives; Quick check - are your metrics appropriate for your target population?
- **Aggregation methods**: Why needed - combining results requires careful consideration; Quick check - does your aggregation method preserve the evaluation intent?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Estimand definition -> Evaluation methodology -> Result interpretation -> Decision making
- **Critical path**: Define scope → Specify data handling → Choose metrics → Determine aggregation → Conduct evaluation → Interpret results
- **Design tradeoffs**: Rigor vs. practicality, specificity vs. generalizability, complexity vs. usability
- **Failure signatures**: Rank reversals, inconsistent results across runs, mismatched evaluation objectives and methodology
- **First experiments**: 1) Apply framework to existing evaluation pipeline, 2) Test for rank reversal sensitivity, 3) Compare results with and without explicit estimand specification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework is well-grounded but practical implementation across diverse ML domains remains largely unproven
- Framework may increase evaluation complexity and resource requirements, potentially limiting adoption in practice
- Generalizability of rank reversal findings to real-world scenarios with varying data distributions is uncertain

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Identification of rank reversal problems is well-supported by theoretical analysis and concrete examples
- **Medium Confidence**: Framework's effectiveness in preventing rank reversals needs empirical validation across diverse ML domains
- **Low Confidence**: Extent to which rank reversals impact real-world model selection decisions remains unclear

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies across multiple ML domains (computer vision, NLP, recommendation systems) to validate whether the estimands framework consistently prevents rank reversals
2. Perform a cost-benefit analysis comparing traditional evaluation methodologies with estimands-based approaches, measuring evaluation time, resource requirements, and accuracy gains
3. Test the framework's applicability to emerging evaluation challenges such as fairness, robustness, and out-of-distribution performance
