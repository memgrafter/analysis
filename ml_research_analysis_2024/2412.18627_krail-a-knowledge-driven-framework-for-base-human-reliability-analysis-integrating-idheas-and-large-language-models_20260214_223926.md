# KRAIL: A Knowledge-Driven Framework for Base Human Reliability Analysis Integrating IDHEAS and Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18627
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18627
- Reference count: 40
- Improves base HEP estimation accuracy by up to 42.86% while reducing time to under 150 seconds

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KRAIL, a knowledge-driven framework that integrates IDHEAS methodology with large language models (LLMs) to enhance base human error probability (HEP) estimation in human reliability analysis (HRA). The framework addresses the traditional challenges of time-consuming manual processes and subjective judgments in HRA by employing a two-stage LLM-driven approach with task decomposition and attribute extraction, supported by knowledge graphs for retrieval-augmented generation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, with statistical significance across different HRA scenarios.

## Method Summary
KRAIL employs a two-stage LLM-driven process for base HEP estimation, beginning with task decomposition to break down complex human error scenarios into manageable components. The framework then extracts relevant attributes from these decomposed tasks using retrieval-augmented generation enhanced by knowledge graphs. This approach integrates the structured IDHEAS methodology with the flexibility of LLMs, creating a hybrid system that leverages both domain-specific knowledge and machine learning capabilities. The framework is designed to systematically identify and quantify human error factors while maintaining consistency with established HRA principles.

## Key Results
- Achieved accuracy improvements of up to 42.86% in PIF measures compared to traditional methods
- Reduced base HEP estimation time to under 150 seconds versus manual approaches
- Demonstrated statistically significant performance gains (p < 0.05) across different HRA scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from combining the structured, systematic approach of IDHEAS with the pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The two-stage process allows for systematic decomposition of complex tasks while maintaining contextual awareness through knowledge graphs. The retrieval-augmented generation component ensures that the LLM's responses are grounded in domain-specific knowledge rather than relying solely on general training data, addressing the reliability concerns typically associated with pure LLM applications in safety-critical domains.

## Foundational Learning

- Knowledge Graphs: Structured representations of domain knowledge. Why needed: Enable retrieval-augmented generation by providing context-specific information. Quick check: Review basic concepts of knowledge graph construction and querying.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): AI technique combining information retrieval with text generation. Why needed: Grounds LLM responses in verified domain knowledge. Quick check: Understand the basic architecture of RAG systems.
- Task Decomposition: Breaking complex tasks into simpler, analyzable components. Why needed: Enables systematic analysis of human error factors. Quick check: Practice breaking down complex scenarios into component tasks.
- Base HEP Estimation: Quantification of human error probability without context-specific factors. Why needed: Core metric for HRA effectiveness evaluation. Quick check: Review standard methods for HEP calculation.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
KRAIL -> Task Decomposition -> Attribute Extraction -> Knowledge Graphs -> IDHEAS Integration -> Base HEP Estimation

Critical Path:
The critical path follows the two-stage LLM process: Task Decomposition → Attribute Extraction → Knowledge Graph Retrieval → Base HEP Calculation. Each stage must complete successfully for accurate estimation.

Design Tradeoffs:
- LLM flexibility vs. structured IDHEAS methodology: Balance between adaptability and standardization
- Knowledge graph comprehensiveness vs. retrieval efficiency: Tradeoff between coverage and response time
- Two-stage process vs. single-pass estimation: Accuracy improvement at cost of additional processing steps

Failure Signatures:
- Inaccurate task decomposition leading to incomplete error scenario analysis
- Attribute extraction errors causing mischaracterization of human error factors
- Knowledge graph retrieval failures resulting in out-of-context LLM responses
- Integration issues between LLM outputs and IDHEAS framework requirements

First Experiments:
1. Test task decomposition accuracy on simple human error scenarios before scaling to complex cases
2. Validate attribute extraction against known HRA case studies to ensure consistency
3. Verify knowledge graph retrieval accuracy by comparing LLM responses with expert judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation based on a relatively small dataset of 80 human error scenarios
- Limited generalizability beyond nuclear power plant applications
- Does not address potential bias introduced by specific LLM architecture or training data

## Confidence

High: Efficiency improvements (time reduction to under 150 seconds)
Medium: Accuracy gains (42.86% PIF improvement with statistical significance)
Low: Generalizability to other HRA domains due to narrow experimental scope

## Next Checks
1. Test KRAIL on a larger, more diverse dataset spanning multiple industries to assess robustness
2. Conduct a longitudinal study to evaluate the framework's performance consistency over time and under varying operational conditions
3. Perform a bias audit of the LLM components to identify and mitigate potential systematic errors in task decomposition and attribute extraction
