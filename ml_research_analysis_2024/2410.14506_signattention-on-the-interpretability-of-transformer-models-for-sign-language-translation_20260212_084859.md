# SignAttention: On the Interpretability of Sign Language Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14506
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14506
- Reference count: 25
- This paper presents the first comprehensive interpretability analysis of a Transformer-based Sign Language Translation (SLT) model

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive interpretability analysis of a Transformer-based Sign Language Translation (SLT) model, focusing on translation from video-based Greek Sign Language to glosses and text. The study examines attention mechanisms within the model to understand how it processes and aligns visual input with sequential glosses. Key findings reveal that the model pays attention to clusters of frames rather than individual ones, with a diagonal alignment pattern emerging between poses and glosses, which becomes less distinct as the number of glosses increases. The analysis also explores the relative contributions of cross-attention and self-attention at each decoding step, finding that the model initially relies on video frames but shifts its focus to previously predicted tokens as the translation progresses. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of SLT models, paving the way for the development of more transparent and reliable translation systems essential for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a Transformer model with 1 encoder layer and 1 decoder layer to perform sign-to-gloss translation using the Greek Sign Language Dataset. The encoder processes pose keypoints extracted from video frames using 1D convolution to create frame embeddings. The decoder employs both cross-attention (for video context) and self-attention (for previous tokens) mechanisms. The model is trained to translate sign language videos into gloss sequences, with translation accuracy measured using Word Error Rate (WER). The interpretability analysis focuses on visualizing and analyzing attention weights to understand how the model maps visual information to linguistic output.

## Key Results
- The model focuses on clusters of frames rather than individual frames when processing sign language videos
- A diagonal alignment pattern emerges between poses and glosses, becoming less distinct with more glosses
- The model initially relies on video frames but shifts focus to previously predicted tokens as translation progresses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The model learns to focus on clusters of frames rather than individual frames during sign recognition.
- Mechanism: The attention mechanism identifies contiguous groups of frames that correspond to the execution of a complete sign, allowing the model to map these clusters to individual glosses.
- Core assumption: Sign language execution involves smooth, continuous movements where multiple frames represent a single semantic unit (sign).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis reveals that the model pays attention to clusters of frames rather than individual ones"
  - [section] "Cross-attention focuses on clusters of frames that can be mapped to the execution of a whole sign, rather than individual frames"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers focus on general SLT but don't discuss frame clustering specifically
- Break condition: If sign language signs were executed in discrete, non-continuous movements where each frame represented a distinct semantic unit, this mechanism would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model establishes a diagonal alignment pattern between poses and glosses, suggesting sequential mapping.
- Mechanism: At each decoding step, the model leverages poses that correspond sequentially with glosses, creating a diagonal attention pattern in the attention matrix.
- Core assumption: There is a consistent temporal relationship between the order of signs in a video and the order of glosses in the target sequence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "with a diagonal alignment pattern emerging between poses and glosses"
  - [section] "The attention between poses and glosses aligns in a pattern resembling a diagonal matrix"
  - [corpus] Moderate - related papers discuss attention mechanisms but not specifically diagonal alignment patterns
- Break condition: If the temporal order of signs in the video did not correspond to the sequential order of glosses, this diagonal pattern would break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model shifts from relying on video frames to previously predicted tokens as translation progresses.
- Mechanism: Initially, cross-attention (video frames) dominates, but as more tokens are predicted, self-attention (previous tokens) becomes increasingly influential, eventually dominating the prediction process.
- Core assumption: Early predictions require more visual information, while later predictions can rely more on linguistic context established by previous tokens.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the model initially relies on video frames but shifts its focus to previously predicted tokens as the translation progresses"
  - [section] "For the translation of a whole sentence, the model initially relies more in video frames but gradually shifts its focus to the previously predicted glosses"
  - [corpus] Moderate - related work mentions attention mechanisms but not this specific progression pattern
- Break condition: If each prediction required equal amounts of visual and linguistic information regardless of position, this shift would not occur.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in Transformer models
  - Why needed here: The entire interpretability analysis relies on understanding how attention weights are computed and distributed across frames and tokens
  - Quick check question: How does scaled dot-product attention compute the final attention weight between a query and key?

- Concept: Sign language grammar and gloss representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the one-to-one relationship between signs and glosses is crucial for interpreting the diagonal alignment pattern
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between gloss representation and written language translation in sign language?

- Concept: Cross-attention vs self-attention in sequence-to-sequence models
  - Why needed here: The analysis specifically examines the relative contributions of these two attention types at each decoding step
  - Quick check question: In a decoder with both cross-attention and self-attention, what are the sources of information for each type?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pose keypoints → 1D convolution encoder → Encoder embeddings → Cross-attention scores → Combined attention vectors → Token predictions → Gloss sequence
- Critical path: Pose keypoints → Encoder embeddings → Cross-attention scores → Combined attention vectors → Token predictions → Gloss sequence
- Design tradeoffs: Single layer architecture chosen for interpretability vs deeper models that might achieve better accuracy but obscure attention patterns
- Failure signatures: Loss of diagonal alignment pattern in attention matrices, cross-attention dominating throughout decoding instead of shifting to self-attention, or attention focusing on individual frames rather than clusters
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Visualize attention weights for a single sample to verify frame clustering behavior
  2. Compare cross-attention vs self-attention contribution at each decoding step for the same sample
  3. Aggregate attention patterns across the test set to confirm diagonal alignment and shifting attention patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different hidden dimension sizes affect the interpretability of attention patterns in SLT models, and at what threshold do these patterns become less interpretable?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that patterns described in the interpretability analysis were not found for larger hidden dimension sizes, suggesting that larger representations allow the encoder to store information about the whole video in a few frames.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests two specific hidden dimension sizes (16 and 32) and does not provide a systematic analysis of how interpretability changes across a broader range of sizes or identify a specific threshold.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying hidden dimension sizes across a wider range (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64, 128) with detailed visualizations of attention patterns for each size, coupled with quantitative metrics measuring interpretability (e.g., diagonal alignment scores, cluster identification accuracy).

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between the grammatical differences between sign language and written language and the interpretability of cross-attention patterns in sign-to-text translation models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes that when trained to generate text instead of glosses, the model still learns to focus on clusters of frames, but these clusters do not align diagonally with words, which is expected due to grammatical differences between the languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide expert validation from translators to determine whether the resulting non-diagonal alignment is meaningful or simply reflects the complexity of translating between grammatically different languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study involving expert sign language translators analyzing the attention patterns of sign-to-text models, correlating specific clusters of frames with the signs they represent and evaluating whether the non-diagonal alignment still captures meaningful linguistic units despite grammatical differences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How generalizable are the observed attention patterns across different sign language datasets and model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states the intention to replicate the analysis in other SLT datasets to analyze the generalizability of the obtained results to other languages.
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses the Greek Sign Language Dataset and one specific Transformer architecture, limiting conclusions about whether the observed patterns are universal or specific to this particular dataset and model configuration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the interpretability analysis on multiple sign language datasets (e.g., PHOENIX14T, CSL-Daily, RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T) using various model architectures (e.g., different Transformer variants, CNN-LSTM hybrids) and comparing the attention patterns across all combinations to identify consistent trends or dataset-specific behaviors.

## Limitations
- The analysis is limited to a single-layer Transformer architecture, which may not capture the complexity of deeper models
- The dataset consists of controlled recordings, potentially limiting generalizability to more naturalistic signing conditions
- The interpretability analysis focuses on attention weights without examining actual feature representations learned in encoder and decoder layers

## Confidence
- High confidence: The observation that the model focuses on clusters of frames rather than individual ones
- Medium confidence: The diagonal alignment pattern between poses and glosses
- Medium confidence: The shifting attention pattern from cross-attention to self-attention during decoding

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the attention pattern analysis on a multi-layer Transformer architecture to determine if the observed frame clustering and diagonal alignment persist with increased model depth
2. Conduct a cross-linguistic validation by applying the same interpretability analysis to a different sign language dataset to test the generalizability of the findings
3. Implement quantitative metrics to measure the relative contribution of cross-attention versus self-attention at each decoding step across the entire test set, rather than relying solely on qualitative visualization
