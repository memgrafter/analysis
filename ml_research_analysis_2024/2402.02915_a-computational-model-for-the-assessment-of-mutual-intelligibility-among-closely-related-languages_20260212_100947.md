- A computational model using Linear Discriminative Learner to assess mutual intelligibility among closely related languages

## Executive Summary
This study presents a computational approach to measuring mutual intelligibility among closely related languages using the Linear Discriminative Learner (LDL). The model leverages multilingual word embeddings and phonological mappings to predict comprehension accuracy between language pairs. Experiments with German, Dutch, and English cognate data demonstrate that the model achieves comprehension accuracy up to 86% for German-Dutch and 85% for German-English when word forms are automatically trimmed of inflections. The results show strong alignment with human participant data, validating the model's effectiveness as a cognitive tool for language comprehension research.

## Method Summary
The computational model employs the Linear Discriminative Learner (LDL) to map phonological forms to semantic vectors using multilingual word embeddings. The approach begins with cognate data from closely related Germanic languages (German, Dutch, English), which are represented as sound sequences and corresponding semantic vectors. The model automatically trims inflections from word forms to improve comprehension accuracy. During inference, the system takes a phonological form from one language and predicts the corresponding semantic vector, which is then compared to the target language's semantic space to assess mutual intelligibility. The evaluation measures comprehension accuracy across different language pairs and with/without inflection trimming.

## Key Results
- Comprehension accuracy reaches up to 86% for German-Dutch and 85% for German-English with trimmed word forms
- Model performance aligns closely with human participant data
- Automatic trimming of inflections significantly improves comprehension accuracy compared to untrimmed forms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by leveraging the phonological similarities between closely related languages and mapping them to shared semantic spaces through multilingual word embeddings. The Linear Discriminative Learner learns to associate sound sequences with semantic vectors, allowing it to recognize cognates across languages despite surface-level phonological differences. The automatic trimming of inflections helps remove language-specific morphological markers that could interfere with cross-linguistic recognition, focusing the model on the core lexical items that carry semantic content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multilingual word embeddings**: Represent words from different languages in a shared semantic space; needed for cross-linguistic semantic comparison
- **Sound classes and phonological mapping**: Convert orthographic representations to phonological features; needed to capture pronunciation similarities
- **Linear Discriminative Learner (LDL)**: Machine learning algorithm for mapping inputs to semantic vectors; needed for the core comprehension prediction task
- **Cognate identification**: Recognizing words with common etymological origins across languages; needed for creating training data
- **Inflection trimming**: Removing morphological endings from words; needed to focus on core lexical items and improve cross-linguistic recognition

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Sound sequences -> LDL mapping -> Semantic vectors -> Comprehension prediction
- **Critical path**: Input phonological form → Inflection trimming → LDL semantic prediction → Semantic space comparison → Comprehension accuracy score
- **Design tradeoffs**: Uses phonological mapping only (simpler, faster) vs. incorporating syntax/semantics (more complex, potentially more accurate)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on distantly related languages, sensitivity to embedding quality, limited by cognate availability
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test model on German-Dutch comprehension with and without inflection trimming
  2. Evaluate comprehension accuracy across all three language pairs (German-Dutch, German-English, Dutch-English)
  3. Compare model predictions against human participant comprehension data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Model relies solely on phonological mappings without incorporating syntactic or semantic processing
- Focus on closely related Germanic languages limits generalizability to more distantly related language pairs
- Evaluation based on controlled cognate sets rather than naturalistic language use
- Does not address cultural or contextual factors that influence language comprehension
- Performance may be sensitive to the quality and coverage of multilingual word embeddings used

## Confidence
- **High** confidence for German-Dutch and German-English language pairs under controlled conditions
- **Medium** confidence in broader applicability to other language families or naturalistic settings
- **Medium** confidence in cognitive plausibility due to simplified phonological-only approach

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on additional language pairs from different language families to evaluate its generalizability beyond Germanic languages
2. Conduct evaluations using naturalistic language corpora rather than controlled cognate sets to assess real-world applicability
3. Compare the model's performance against other computational approaches that incorporate syntactic and semantic processing to determine the relative contribution of phonological mapping to mutual intelligibility
