# Tabular and Deep Learning for the Whittle Index

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02057
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02057
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Two reinforcement learning algorithms (QWI and QWINN) for learning Whittle indices in Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QWI (tabular) and QWINN (deep learning) algorithms for learning Whittle indices in Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Problems (RMABPs). The key innovation is a two-time-scale approach where state-action Q-values are updated quickly while Whittle indices are updated slowly. QWI converges to true Whittle indices under indexability conditions, while QWINN leverages neural networks to handle large state spaces. Both algorithms outperform standard Q-learning, DQN, and NeurWIN in convergence speed and policy quality across multiple benchmark problems.

## Method Summary
The paper presents two reinforcement learning algorithms for Whittle index computation. QWI uses tabular Q-learning with a two-time-scale approach: fast updates of state-action Q-values and slow updates of Whittle indices. The algorithm iteratively adjusts both the Whittle index and state-action function estimates. QWINN extends this approach using neural networks to approximate Q-values, employing Double Q-Learning and experience replay. Both algorithms operate under the assumption that the RMABP is indexable, meaning there exists a unique Whittle index for each state that correctly orders states by priority.

## Key Results
- QWI and QWINN outperform standard Q-learning, DQN, and NeurWIN in convergence speed and policy quality
- QWINN provides the first stability analysis for DQN-based Whittle index learning schemes
- Numerical results show superior performance on restart, deadline scheduling, and circular problems
- QWINN effectively handles problems with large state spaces by extrapolating from limited samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-time-scale approach allows for stable learning of Whittle indices by decoupling the fast learning of state-action values from the slow adaptation of index values. This separation prevents the Whittle index updates from interfering with the Q-value learning process, enabling convergence to the true indices under indexability conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Problems**: Framework for sequential decision making with multiple projects requiring periodic attention
  - Why needed: The problem setting that Whittle indices solve
  - Quick check: Verify the Markov decision process formulation with active/inactive states

- **Whittle Index Policy**: Priority-based scheduling policy using index values to rank states
  - Why needed: The optimal solution target for the learning algorithms
  - Quick check: Confirm indexability conditions hold for the specific problem instances

- **Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation**: Learning framework with different update rates for different parameters
  - Why needed: Enables stable convergence of both Q-values and Whittle indices
  - Quick check: Verify the relative magnitudes of learning rates (α vs β) follow the required conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
RMABP Environment -> QWI/QWINN Agent -> Whittle Index Policy -> Action Selection -> Reward/Transition Feedback

**Critical Path:**
State observation → Q-value estimation → Whittle index update → Policy action → Reward collection → Parameter update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Tabular vs neural network representation: accuracy vs scalability
- Learning rate separation: convergence speed vs stability
- Exploration strategy: thorough search vs efficient exploitation

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor convergence: Learning rates too high or exploration insufficient
- Suboptimal policy: Incorrect state ordering due to index estimation errors
- Instability: Violation of two-time-scale conditions or indexability assumptions

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify QWI convergence on small restart problem with known Whittle indices
2. Test QWINN performance scaling with increasing state space size
3. Compare convergence rates of QWI vs standard Q-learning on deadline scheduling problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Under what general conditions does Assumption 3.1 (local contraction of 𝐹(𝜏)) hold for QWINN? The paper notes this requires further theoretical investigation beyond numerical verification.

2. How does QWINN's performance degrade in partially observable Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Problems? The authors identify this as an interesting future research direction.

3. What are the finite-time regret bounds for QWI and QWINN in Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Problems? The paper does not analyze regret, identifying this as a research direction.

## Limitations
- Neural network architecture details for QWINN are not fully specified
- Comparison with NeurWIN limited by incomplete implementation details
- Theoretical convergence guarantees for deep learning approach not fully established
- Results depend heavily on specific problem instances and hyperparameter settings

## Confidence
- Theoretical foundations for QWI: High
- QWINN stability analysis: Medium
- Empirical performance claims: Medium
- Generalizability across problem types: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement QWI and verify convergence on small RMABP with known Whittle indices
2. Replicate the numerical experiments comparing QWI/QWINN with Q-learning and DQN
3. Test QWINN's performance degradation as state space size increases
