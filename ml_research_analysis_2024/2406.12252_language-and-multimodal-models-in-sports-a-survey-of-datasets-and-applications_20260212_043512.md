## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal dataset characteristics for training real-time sports analytics models that balance accuracy and latency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for real-time processing capabilities in sports applications, particularly for professionals requiring high-precision data during games.
- Why unresolved: Current datasets focus on post-game analysis or non-real-time applications. There is a lack of comprehensive datasets specifically designed for real-time sports analytics that capture the temporal dynamics and rapid decision-making required during live events.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of benchmark datasets containing high-frequency, temporally dense sports data with ground truth annotations for real-time performance metrics, along with ablation studies showing latency-accuracy trade-offs across different dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 2

- What evidence would resolve it: Creation of a standardized framework for multimodal dataset annotation that includes fan preference indicators, coupled with empirical studies demonstrating how such datasets improve personalization metrics across multiple sports.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective methods for converting existing single-modal sports datasets into multimodal resources that maintain data integrity and annotation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the concept of "convertible datasets" and discusses their potential for transformation into multimodal datasets through annotation, but does not detail specific conversion methodologies.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies convertible datasets as a category but does not provide concrete methodologies, best practices, or evaluation criteria for the conversion process, leaving open questions about how to maintain data quality and integrity during transformation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different conversion methodologies applied to the same base dataset, with quantitative assessments of annotation quality, data integrity metrics, and downstream task performance improvements.
