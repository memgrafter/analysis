- Primary result: DALL-E 2 with ChatGPT-generated 50-word prompts produces the most surrealistic-like images among tested models

## Executive Summary
This study explored generating surrealism-like images using vision-language models (DALL-E 2, Deep Dream Generator, DreamStudio) with base images and prompts. The primary finding was that DALL-E 2, when paired with ChatGPT-generated prompts (especially 50-word versions), outperformed the other models in producing images matching surrealism-like criteria. Longer prompts consistently yielded better results, while downscaling base images slightly improved outcomes compared to blurring. Deep Dream Generator performed best with simple YOLO labels. These findings highlight the potential of combining language models with image generation to inspire artistic creativity, with DALL-E 2 emerging as the most effective tool for creating surrealism-like imagery when provided with detailed textual guidance.

## Method Summary
The study used 6 realist paintings as base images, processed through YOLO object detection to generate labels. ChatGPT-3 created prompts of varying lengths (15 words, 50 words) with and without artist names. These prompts were used with DALL-E 2, Deep Dream Generator, and DreamStudio to generate images. Human evaluation by 18 artists assessed surrealism-like qualities including dreamlike atmosphere, unexpected juxtapositions, symbolism, subversion of logic, and unconscious exploration. The survey compared different prompt settings and base image preprocessing techniques (downscaling vs blurring).

## Key Results
- DALL-E 2 with ChatGPT-generated 50-word prompts produced the highest-rated surrealism-like images
- Longer prompts consistently outperformed shorter prompts across all models
- Downscaling base images yielded slightly better results than blurring for preprocessing
- Deep Dream Generator performed best when using simple YOLO labels rather than generated prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DALL-E 2 with ChatGPT-generated 50-word prompts produces the most surrealistic-like images because longer prompts provide richer contextual guidance to the model.
- Mechanism: The model uses extended textual descriptions to infer compositional elements, symbolic references, and abstract concepts, enabling generation of more complex and layered imagery aligned with surrealist aesthetics.
- Core assumption: Vision-language models can interpret nuanced textual prompts and translate them into meaningful visual compositions that reflect surrealistic criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Longer prompts consistently yielded better results"
  - [section] "Longer prompts offer richer contextual information, enabling generative image models to produce more surrealistic-like results"
- Break condition: If the model fails to parse prompt semantics or the text exceeds effective input length, generation quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating artist names (e.g., Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst) into prompts enhances surrealistic qualities by biasing generation toward recognized surrealist styles.
- Mechanism: Named stylistic references activate learned associations in the model linking those artists to their visual motifs, thereby shaping the output to emulate their surrealistic characteristics.
- Core assumption: The model has been trained on data associating artist names with distinctive visual styles, and these associations can be leveraged through prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "incorporating surrealistic artist names along with the ChatGPT generated prompt significantly enhances the surrealistic quality of the images"
  - [section] "DALL-E generated images with a higher resemblance to the specified artist’s style"
- Break condition: If artist names are absent from training data or not strongly associated with surrealistic imagery, the prompt will not influence style.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Downscaling base images improves generation outcomes compared to blurring because downscaling preserves essential structural cues while reducing noise.
- Mechanism: Smaller base images reduce computational load and allow the model to focus on core compositional features, while blurring may obscure critical visual information.
- Core assumption: Base image preprocessing influences the model's ability to interpret and transform source content into surrealistic outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "downscaled base images as input to the model increased in votes across generations, when contrasted with the utilization of blurred base images"
  - [section] "downscaling technique may outperform blurring in enhancing the quality of generated surrealistic artworks"
- Break condition: If the model is insensitive to base image preprocessing or relies more heavily on text, preprocessing effects diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-language model architecture (e.g., DALL-E 2)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how text-to-image models interpret and generate imagery is essential to explaining why prompt length and content affect output quality.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the text encoder in a vision-language model like DALL-E 2?

- Concept: Surrealism aesthetic principles (dreamlike atmosphere, unexpected juxtapositions, symbolism)
  - Why needed here: The evaluation criteria for generated images are based on these surrealist features, so understanding them is necessary to interpret the results.
  - Quick check question: How do unexpected juxtapositions contribute to the surrealistic quality of an image?

- Concept: YOLO object detection
  - Why needed here: YOLO labels were used to generate prompts; knowing how it works clarifies why object-based prompts were chosen and their limitations.
  - Quick check question: What type of output does YOLO provide for an input image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base images → YOLO object detection → ChatGPT prompt generation → DALL-E 2/Deep Dream Generator/DreamStudio → Image generation → Human evaluation survey
- Critical path: YOLO → ChatGPT → DALL-E 2 → Image → Survey → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt length vs. model input limits
  - Base image preprocessing choice (downscale vs blur)
  - Text-only vs. image+text generation modes
  - Human evaluation subjectivity vs. automated metrics
- Failure signatures:
  - Low survey scores across all models
  - Inconsistent model behavior with same prompts
  - YOLO fails to detect relevant objects
  - ChatGPT produces irrelevant or repetitive prompts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate images with YOLO labels only (baseline)
  2. Generate images with 15-word ChatGPT prompts
  3. Generate images with 50-word ChatGPT prompts including artist names

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different base image editing techniques (e.g., contrast adjustment, color filtering, geometric transformations) beyond blurring and downscaling affect the surrealistic-like image generation quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only tested blurring and downscaling effects on base images, finding limited impact, suggesting other editing techniques might yield different results
- Why unresolved: The study's scope was limited to only two editing techniques (blurring and downscaling), leaving other potential editing methods unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of various image editing techniques (contrast, color filters, geometric transformations) on base images across multiple generative models, measuring their impact on surrealism-like qualities

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does incorporating artist names in prompts have a consistent effect across different art movements beyond surrealism (e.g., impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper found that including artist names improved surrealism-like qualities in DALL-E outputs but noted this wasn't tested for other art movements
- Why unresolved: The experiment only tested artist names within the surrealism context, without exploring other artistic styles or movements
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using artist names from various art movements across different generative models, measuring the consistency and effectiveness of this approach

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between prompt specificity and creativity for generating high-quality surrealistic-like images?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study found that longer prompts generally improved results, but didn't explore the relationship between prompt specificity, creativity, and image quality in detail
- Why unresolved: The paper tested prompt length but didn't systematically vary the balance between specific instructions and creative elements in prompts
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying prompt structure and content balance while measuring surrealism-like qualities and overall image quality metrics

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the resolution of generated images affect the perception of surrealism-like qualities by human evaluators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentioned DALL-E's limitation to square images but didn't investigate how different output resolutions impact artistic perception
- Why unresolved: The study focused on content and style rather than technical aspects like resolution that might influence artistic perception
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies generating images at different resolutions and having evaluators rate surrealism-like qualities across various resolution levels

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on subjective human evaluation by a small panel of 18 artists introduces potential bias
- Exact survey questions and evaluation criteria not fully specified, making independent replication difficult
- Comparison across different models is somewhat limited, with DALL-E 2 appearing to be the primary focus
- Study does not address potential copyright issues with using real artist names in prompts

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: DALL-E 2 with ChatGPT-generated 50-word prompts consistently produces better surrealism-like images than other tested configurations
- **Medium confidence**: Incorporating artist names enhances surrealistic qualities, but results may be influenced by specific artists chosen
- **Low confidence**: Mechanism by which YOLO labels translate to effective prompts is not well-explained

## Next Checks

1. Conduct the same experiment with a larger and more diverse panel of evaluators (minimum 50 participants across different artistic backgrounds) using the exact same base images and prompt configurations to verify the statistical significance of the findings.

2. Systematically vary and document the generation parameters (resolution, style settings, aspect ratios) for all three models under identical conditions to determine if the observed performance differences are due to model architecture or parameter settings.

3. Test alternative prompt structures beyond simple YOLO labels and ChatGPT outputs, including multi-sentence descriptions, symbolic references, and comparative language, to identify which prompt elements most strongly influence surrealistic quality across different models.
