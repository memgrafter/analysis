# Domain-specific long text classification from sparse relevant information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13253
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a hierarchical model for classifying long domain-specific documents where relevant information is sparse and represented by specific technical terms.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of classifying long domain-specific documents where relevant information is sparse and often represented by a few specific technical terms. The authors propose a hierarchical model that first filters sentences based on a short list of target terms, then uses contextualized embeddings of these terms within their sentences to construct a document representation for classification. The model is evaluated on both a public English medical dataset and a private French medical dataset, showing superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches including larger language models and hierarchical deep models. The method demonstrates robustness to noise in the target term list and achieves high accuracy in identifying sparse relevant information in long documents.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a hierarchical approach to long text classification. First, sentences are filtered based on a predefined list of target terms relevant to the domain. For each sentence containing these terms, contextualized embeddings are generated using BERT-based models. These sentence embeddings are then aggregated to form a document-level representation, which is used for classification. The approach leverages the fact that in domain-specific documents, relevant information is often sparse and concentrated around specific technical terms. By focusing on these terms and their contextual usage, the model can efficiently process long documents while maintaining high classification accuracy.

## Key Results
- The proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches including larger language models on both English and French medical datasets
- The method shows robustness to noise in the target term list, maintaining high performance even with irrelevant terms
- The hierarchical filtering approach significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining classification accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the domain-specific nature of the documents where relevant information is sparse and concentrated around specific technical terms. By first filtering sentences based on these target terms, the model reduces the computational burden of processing long documents. The use of contextualized embeddings ensures that the meaning of terms within their specific sentence context is captured, rather than just their surface form. This hierarchical approach allows the model to focus computational resources on the most relevant parts of the document while still maintaining a global understanding through the aggregation of sentence-level representations.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Contextualized Embeddings**: Why needed - To capture the meaning of terms within their specific sentence context rather than just their surface form. Quick check - Compare performance with and without contextualized embeddings on a small validation set.

2. **Hierarchical Document Representation**: Why needed - To efficiently process long documents by first filtering relevant sentences, then aggregating sentence-level information. Quick check - Verify that filtering based on target terms significantly reduces document length while maintaining classification accuracy.

3. **Target Term Filtering**: Why needed - To identify and focus on the sparse relevant information in domain-specific documents. Quick check - Test model performance with varying numbers of target terms to find the optimal balance between coverage and noise.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document -> Sentence Filter (Target Terms) -> Contextualized Embeddings (BERT) -> Sentence Aggregation -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves filtering sentences using target terms, generating contextualized embeddings for these sentences, aggregating these embeddings into a document representation, and using this representation for classification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off some potential information loss from filtering sentences against significant computational efficiency gains. It also relies on having a good list of target terms, though it demonstrates robustness to noise in this list.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures could occur when relevant information is not captured by the target terms, when the target terms list is too noisy, or when the contextualization fails to capture important nuances in the domain-specific language.

**Exactly 3 first experiments**:
1. Test the model's performance with different sizes of target term lists to find the optimal balance between coverage and noise.
2. Compare the proposed hierarchical approach against a baseline that processes the entire document without filtering.
3. Evaluate the model's robustness by introducing varying levels of noise into the target term list and measuring performance degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on only two datasets (one public English medical dataset and one private French medical dataset), limiting generalizability to other domains or languages
- The claim of superior performance compared to larger language models needs clarification regarding model size differences and computational efficiency trade-offs
- The method's performance on non-medical domains remains unknown

## Confidence

High confidence:
- The hierarchical filtering approach using target terms to reduce computational complexity is well-established
- The claim about robustness to noise in target term lists appears reasonable given the methodology

Medium confidence:
- The superiority claims over state-of-the-art approaches are supported by evaluation on specific datasets but may not generalize beyond the medical domain

Low confidence:
- The scalability claims for handling very long documents
- The assertion that this approach is broadly applicable to "sparse relevant information" scenarios across different domains

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the model on at least two non-medical domains (e.g., legal or technical documentation) to verify cross-domain applicability and test whether the sparse relevant information assumption holds.

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the exact contribution of each component (target term filtering vs. contextualized embeddings) and determine the minimum viable model size for achieving competitive performance.

3. Test the model's performance with intentionally noisy target term lists (varying percentages of irrelevant terms) to empirically validate the claimed robustness and establish performance degradation curves.
