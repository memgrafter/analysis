# Towards Unified Modeling for Positive and Negative Preferences in Sign-Aware Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.08246
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08246

- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.9-5.8% on Beauty, 10.6-14.2% on Book, and 3.1-5.5% on Yelp in terms of Precision@10, Recall@10, and NDCG@10

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical limitation in existing sign-aware recommendation methods that use separate encoders for positive and negative interactions, thereby missing negative preferences from high-order heterogeneous interactions. The authors propose LSGRec, a Light Signed Graph Convolution Network that employs unified modeling to simultaneously capture both high-order positive and negative preferences on signed user-item graphs. By using homophily-based propagation along positive edges and incorporating a negative preference filter, the method captures first-order negative preferences through negative links while extracting high-order negative preferences. The model is trained using multi-task learning objectives including sign-aware BPR loss, rating prediction, and orthogonality constraint.

## Method Summary
LSGRec introduces a unified modeling approach that leverages signed graph convolution networks to capture both positive and negative preferences in recommendation systems. The method uses a light signed graph convolution network that propagates information through both positive and negative edges while applying a negative preference filter to distinguish meaningful negative signals from noise. The model employs multi-task learning with three objectives: sign-aware Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss for preference discrimination, rating prediction for explicit feedback, and orthogonality constraint to prevent feature collapse in latent representations. This unified approach allows the model to capture high-order negative preferences through homophily-based propagation along positive edges, addressing the limitation of existing methods that only consider first-order negative interactions.

## Key Results
- LSGRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.9-5.8% on Amazon-Beauty dataset
- LSGRec achieves 10.6-14.2% improvement on Amazon-Book dataset
- LSGRec shows 3.1-5.5% gains on Yelp2021 dataset across Precision@10, Recall@10, and NDCG@10 metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The unified modeling approach in LSGRec works by simultaneously processing positive and negative interactions through a single network architecture rather than separate encoders. This allows the model to capture high-order negative preferences that propagate through the graph via homophily-based mechanisms along positive edges. The negative preference filter serves as a crucial component that distinguishes genuine negative signals from noise in the high-order propagation process. The orthogonality constraint ensures that the latent representations maintain sufficient diversity to capture distinct preference patterns, while the multi-task learning framework provides complementary supervision signals that improve overall recommendation quality.

## Foundational Learning

**Signed Graph Convolution Networks** - Why needed: To process both positive and negative interactions in a unified framework. Quick check: Verify that the network can propagate information through both edge types while maintaining distinct representations.

**Homophily-based Propagation** - Why needed: To capture high-order negative preferences through the structural patterns in positive interactions. Quick check: Ensure that similar users/items connected through positive edges share preference patterns while maintaining distinction from negative associations.

**Negative Preference Filtering** - Why needed: To distinguish meaningful negative signals from noise in high-order interactions. Quick check: Validate that the filter effectively suppresses false negative signals while preserving genuine negative preferences.

**Multi-task Learning Framework** - Why needed: To provide complementary supervision signals for improved recommendation quality. Quick check: Confirm that combining BPR loss, rating prediction, and orthogonality constraint leads to better performance than individual objectives.

**Orthogonality Constraint** - Why needed: To prevent feature collapse and maintain diverse latent representations. Quick check: Verify that the constraint maintains sufficient separation between positive and negative preference representations.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User-Item Graph -> Signed Graph Convolution -> Negative Preference Filter -> Multi-task Learning (BPR Loss + Rating Prediction + Orthogonality Constraint) -> Recommendation Output

Critical Path: The signed graph convolution network processes the input graph structure, applying the negative preference filter during message passing to distinguish high-order negative signals. The filtered representations then flow into the multi-task learning framework where the three objectives jointly optimize the model parameters.

Design Tradeoffs: Unified modeling versus separate encoders for positive and negative preferences - unified approach captures richer interaction patterns but requires more sophisticated filtering mechanisms. The choice of multi-task learning objectives balances recommendation accuracy with representation quality, while the orthogonality constraint adds computational overhead but prevents representation collapse.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance may indicate inadequate negative preference filtering leading to noisy high-order signals, or insufficient orthogonality constraint causing feature collapse. Model degradation could also result from improper balance between the three multi-task objectives.

First Experiments:
1. Train LSGRec on a small subset of data with only first-order interactions to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate the impact of the negative preference filter by comparing performance with and without filtering
3. Test different weightings for the multi-task objectives to find optimal balance between BPR loss, rating prediction, and orthogonality constraint

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but implicit questions remain regarding the generalizability of the unified modeling approach across different datasets and the optimal balance between capturing high-order negative preferences and avoiding noise amplification.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of the negative preference filter in distinguishing high-order negative signals from noise requires further validation
- The orthogonality constraint's impact on model performance needs clearer quantification through ablation studies
- The multi-task learning framework may introduce optimization challenges that are not fully explored

## Confidence

High confidence: The experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across three datasets, with LSGRec outperforming baselines in all metrics (Precision@10, Recall@10, NDCG@10).

Medium confidence: The claim that high-order negative preferences are effectively captured through homophily-based propagation along positive edges, as this mechanism may not generalize well to datasets with different interaction patterns or noise levels.

Low confidence: The assertion that unified modeling is superior to separate encoders for all sign-aware recommendation scenarios, particularly in cases with extreme class imbalance or highly heterogeneous user-item interactions.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the negative preference filter to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains

2. Test LSGRec on additional datasets with different interaction densities and sign distributions to evaluate robustness

3. Perform qualitative analysis of learned representations to verify that negative preferences are indeed captured in high-order interactions rather than being dominated by positive signals
