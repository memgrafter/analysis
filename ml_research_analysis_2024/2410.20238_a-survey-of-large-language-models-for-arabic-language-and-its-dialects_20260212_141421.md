# A Survey of Large Language Models for Arabic Language and its Dialects

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.20238
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20238
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey analyzing 34 Arabic LLM papers, highlighting limited model openness and the need for diverse dialectal datasets.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic and its dialects, analyzing architectures, training datasets, downstream tasks, and model openness. It covers encoder-only (e.g., BERT, ELECTRA), decoder-only (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5) across monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual variants. Datasets span Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Dialectal Arabic, with notable gaps in dialectal representation. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and F1 scores across tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. The survey highlights limited model openness, with most models partially available, stressing the need for greater transparency to enhance reproducibility and research. Future directions emphasize diverse dialectal datasets, novel architectures, and standardized benchmarks to advance Arabic NLP.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviewed 34 research papers on Arabic LLMs collected through keyword searches and citation tracking, covering various model architectures and datasets. The methodology involved collecting papers using keywords like "Arabic LLM" and "Arabic dialect LLM" from academic search engines, verifying relevance through abstract and conclusion reviews, and analyzing the verified papers to extract information on model architectures, datasets, tasks, and evaluation metrics. The survey assessed model openness based on factors such as source code availability, training data, model weights, and documentation.

## Key Results
- Encoder-only architectures (BERT, ELECTRA) dominate Arabic NLP due to their bidirectional context capture, crucial for understanding Arabic's complex morphology.
- Dialectal Arabic datasets are significantly underrepresented, despite their importance for real-world Arabic language use and performance on dialect-specific tasks.
- Most Arabic LLMs have limited openness, with partial availability of code, data, or weights, hindering reproducibility and further research.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Encoder-only architectures (BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa) dominate Arabic NLP because they capture bidirectional context, crucial for understanding Arabic's complex morphology.
- Mechanism: These models are pre-trained on large-scale Arabic text corpora and fine-tuned for tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, and QA. Their bidirectional nature allows them to capture the full context of a word based on both preceding and subsequent words, which is essential for understanding Arabic's rich morphology and syntactic structures.
- Core assumption: Bidirectional context is more effective for understanding Arabic's morphological complexity than unidirectional approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "encoder-only models (for example, BERT [5], ELECTRA [6] and RoBERTa [7])"
  - [section]: "These models were first developed for tasks that require understanding text, such as predicting categories for input text in text classification and next sentence prediction [5]."
  - [corpus]: Weak, no direct corpus evidence for this specific claim.
- Break condition: If unidirectional models (like GPT) outperform encoder-only models on Arabic tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diverse dialectal datasets are crucial for Arabic LLMs to capture the nuances of spoken language and improve performance on real-world tasks.
- Mechanism: Models trained on a combination of MSA and DA datasets (e.g., MARBERT, JASMINE) show better performance on dialect-specific tasks like dialect identification and sentiment analysis in dialectal contexts.
- Core assumption: Real-world Arabic language use involves a mix of MSA and various dialects, so models need exposure to this diversity during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Dialectal Arabic"
  - [section]: "Dialectal Arabic (DA) refers to the diverse spoken forms of Arabic...Given the widespread use of DA in daily conversations, integrating DA resources into the training of LLMs is essential..."
  - [corpus]: Strong, the corpus analysis explicitly shows the distribution of models across different Arabic language forms and dialects.
- Break condition: If models trained solely on MSA perform equally well on dialect-specific tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Openness in Arabic LLMs, including code, data, and weights availability, is essential for reproducibility and further research.
- Mechanism: The survey assesses the openness of Arabic LLMs based on factors such as source code availability, training data, model weights, and documentation. This assessment highlights the importance of transparency for enabling other researchers to build upon and validate existing work.
- Core assumption: Open models and datasets foster collaboration and accelerate progress in the field.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The survey highlights limited model openness, with most models partially available, stressing the need for greater transparency to enhance reproducibility and research."
  - [section]: "Our findings highlight the importance of openness for reproducibility and transparency and facilitate further research and development in the field."
  - [corpus]: Weak, no direct corpus evidence for this specific claim.
- Break condition: If closed-source models consistently outperform open-source models in Arabic NLP tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architectures
  - Why needed here: Understanding the core architecture (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) is fundamental to grasping how different Arabic LLMs are designed and their strengths/weakcomings.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder transformer architectures, and what tasks are they best suited for?

- Concept: Arabic language complexity
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the unique challenges of Arabic (diglossia, morphological complexity, dialectal variation) is crucial for understanding why specialized Arabic LLMs are needed and how they differ from models for other languages.
  - Quick check question: What are the key linguistic features of Arabic that make it challenging for NLP models, and how do these features influence model design and training data requirements?

- Concept: Pre-training and fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Understanding the process of pre-training on large corpora and fine-tuning on specific tasks is essential for grasping how Arabic LLMs are developed and evaluated.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between pre-training and fine-tuning in the context of LLMs, and why are both steps necessary for developing effective Arabic NLP models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Ingestion -> Pre-training -> Fine-tuning -> Evaluation
- Critical path:
  1. Data collection and preprocessing
  2. Model selection and architecture design
  3. Pre-training on large-scale Arabic corpora
  4. Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets
  5. Evaluation and benchmarking

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. computational resources: Larger models generally perform better but require more computational power.
  - Data diversity vs. data quality: Balancing the need for diverse dialectal data with the need for high-quality, clean text.
  - Bidirectional vs. unidirectional architectures: Choosing the right architecture based on the task and the nature of Arabic language.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on dialect-specific tasks: Indicates insufficient dialectal data during training.
  - High perplexity scores: Suggests the model struggles to understand the nuances of Arabic language.
  - Overfitting to specific datasets: Indicates the need for more diverse training data or regularization techniques.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a sentiment analysis dataset for MSA and evaluate its performance.
  2. Compare the performance of a BERT-based model and a GPT-based model on a dialect identification task.
  3. Assess the impact of adding dialectal data to the training corpus on the performance of a sentiment analysis model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1

- Why unresolved: The paper provides an overview of Arabic LLMs and their performance on different tasks, but does not delve into the specific impact of Arabic's linguistic complexity on the effectiveness of different architectural approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of different LLM architectures on Arabic-specific linguistic tasks (e.g., morphological analysis, syntactic parsing) and analyzing the relationship between architectural design choices and performance on these tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for incorporating dialectal Arabic data into the training of LLMs to improve their performance on dialect-specific tasks while maintaining proficiency in MSA and CA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for more diverse dialectal datasets and the importance of developing models that can handle the linguistic diversity of Arabic. It also mentions the limited availability of dialectal data compared to MSA and CA.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the challenge of representing dialectal Arabic in LLMs but does not provide specific strategies for effectively integrating dialectal data into the training process while balancing the representation of different Arabic forms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research on different data sampling techniques, curriculum learning approaches, or domain adaptation methods that can effectively incorporate dialectal data into LLM training and evaluate their impact on performance across MSA, CA, and dialectal tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the level of openness of Arabic LLMs (availability of code, data, weights, and documentation) impact their adoption, reproducibility, and contribution to the advancement of Arabic NLP research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assesses the openness of Arabic LLMs based on factors such as the availability of source code, training data, model weights, and documentation, and highlights the importance of openness for reproducibility and transparency.
- Why unresolved: While the paper evaluates the openness of existing Arabic LLMs, it does not investigate the direct impact of openness on the broader research community, such as the rate of adoption, the ability to reproduce results, or the generation of new research ideas.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing the usage, citation, and extension of open-source Arabic LLMs versus closed-source models, as well as surveys of researchers on the barriers and enablers for Arabic NLP research related to model openness.

## Limitations
- The survey may have missed emerging models or papers published after the search cutoff.
- Performance comparisons across different model types are limited by inconsistent evaluation metrics and task definitions across studies.
- The survey cannot fully assess the practical utility of models in real-world applications due to limited information on deployment contexts and user feedback.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Architectural classification of models and identification of key training datasets are well-supported by the literature. The observation about limited model openness is consistently documented.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about dialectal dataset gaps are supported by corpus analysis but may underrepresent specialized dialectal resources not widely published.
- **Low Confidence**: Performance comparisons across different model types are limited by inconsistent evaluation metrics and task definitions across studies.

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Coverage Audit**: Verify the completeness of dialectal Arabic datasets by cross-referencing with community-maintained repositories and industry datasets not captured in academic publications.
2. **Reproducibility Assessment**: Attempt to reproduce key results from at least three Arabic LLM papers, focusing on both model performance and openness claims regarding code and data availability.
3. **Benchmark Standardization**: Evaluate the feasibility of establishing standardized evaluation benchmarks for Arabic LLMs by analyzing task definitions, metrics, and dataset consistency across the surveyed papers.
