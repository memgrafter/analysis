# Visual Knowledge in the Big Model Era: Retrospect and Prospect

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04308
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04308
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: Visual knowledge provides explicit, structured, persistent, editable, and traceable representation that can address transparency, reasoning, and catastrophic forgetting limitations in big AI models.

## Executive Summary
Visual knowledge represents a new paradigm for knowledge representation that encapsulates visual concepts and their relations in an interpretable manner. Drawing from cognitive psychology, it emphasizes the importance of visual concepts, relations, operations, and reasoning in establishing machine intelligence. The paper reviews the development of visual knowledge pre-big model era and explores its opportunities in the current landscape. Key findings include prototype-and-scope representation for visual concepts, categorization of visual relations (geometric, temporal, semantic, functional, causal), definition of visual operations (composition, decomposition, replacement, combination, deformation, motion, comparison, destruction, restoration, prediction), and the importance of visual reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
This paper presents a theoretical review and synthesis of visual knowledge concepts and their potential integration with large AI models. The methodology involves comprehensive literature review spanning cognitive psychology foundations and recent advances in visual knowledge representation. The authors analyze research on visual concepts, relations, operations, and reasoning, synthesizing findings to explore opportunities and challenges for visual knowledge in the big model era. No specific datasets or experimental methodologies are described, as this is primarily a theoretical review paper.

## Key Results
- Visual knowledge framework enhances interpretability of big models through prototype-and-scope representation
- Explicit modeling of visual relations provides structured knowledge for reasoning tasks
- Visual knowledge addresses catastrophic forgetting by providing persistent, editable, and traceable knowledge representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual knowledge framework enhances interpretability of big models by making visual concepts explicit and structured.
- Mechanism: Prototype-and-scope based representation allows direct mapping from learned features to interpretable visual categories.
- Core assumption: Prototype-and-scope representation captures sufficient variance to maintain classification accuracy while adding interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The integration of visual knowledge into the large models offers a promising avenue for advancement" addressing transparency limitations
  - [section 4.1] "The integration of visual knowledge may endow big models with promising ad-hoc interpretability" through prototype-and-scope representation
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If prototype-and-scope representation cannot maintain classification accuracy or becomes computationally prohibitive at scale.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Visual knowledge enables big models to perform reasoning tasks requiring symbolic manipulation and causality understanding.
- Mechanism: Explicit modeling of visual relations (geometric, temporal, semantic, functional, causal) provides structured knowledge for reasoning operations.
- Core assumption: Big models can effectively integrate explicit symbolic knowledge with their statistical pattern recognition capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reasoning about their transformations, compositions, comparisons, predictions, and narrations" as key capabilities of visual knowledge
  - [section 4.1] "visual knowledge provides an explicit, powerful, and unified framework for the comprehensive modeling of visual conceptions, visual relations (including causality), visual operations, and visual reasoning"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this integration mechanism
- Break condition: If integration of symbolic and statistical knowledge proves incompatible or creates performance bottlenecks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Visual knowledge addresses catastrophic forgetting by providing persistent, editable, and traceable knowledge representation.
- Mechanism: External knowledge base with explicit visual concepts allows selective updating without overwriting learned parameters.
- Core assumption: Visual knowledge can be maintained separately from model parameters while still being effectively utilized during inference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Visual knowledge is "explicit, structured, persistent, editable, and traceable" addressing knowledge trace issues
  - [section 4.1] "At the heart of catastrophic forgetting lies the difficulty of knowledge trace within big AI models" and visual knowledge offers solution
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific forgetting mitigation approach
- Break condition: If maintaining separate knowledge base creates synchronization issues or degrades real-time performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prototype-and-scope representation
  - Why needed here: Provides interpretable visual concept representation that can enhance transparency of big models
  - Quick check question: How does prototype-and-scope differ from traditional class centroid approaches in handling intra-class variance?

- Concept: Visual relations taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Enables structured reasoning about visual concepts through geometric, temporal, semantic, functional, and causal relations
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes functional relations from causal relations in visual knowledge framework?

- Concept: Visual operations
  - Why needed here: Defines transformations over visual concepts essential for reasoning and problem-solving capabilities
  - Quick check question: Which visual operations would be most critical for predicting future states of dynamic scenes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Visual Knowledge Base: Stores prototype-and-scope representations, visual relations, and operations
  - Integration Layer: Bridges big model outputs with visual knowledge representations
  - Reasoning Engine: Applies visual operations and relations for inference
  - Traceability Module: Maintains provenance and edit history of knowledge elements

- Critical path:
  1. Input visual data → Big model feature extraction
  2. Feature mapping to visual knowledge base prototypes
  3. Relation and operation application for reasoning
  4. Output generation with interpretability traces

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. performance: More explicit knowledge representation may reduce model efficiency
  - Knowledge update frequency vs. stability: Frequent updates may prevent catastrophic forgetting but reduce consistency
  - Scope granularity vs. coverage: Finer scopes increase precision but require more storage and computation

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation when visual knowledge base becomes outdated
  - Increased inference latency due to knowledge base queries
  - Inconsistent outputs when multiple knowledge representations conflict

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Prototype-and-scope classifier comparison: Replace standard softmax classifier with prototype-based approach on ImageNet
  2. Relation integration test: Add geometric relation constraints to object detection model and measure accuracy changes
  3. Catastrophic forgetting mitigation: Evaluate forgetting rates with and without visual knowledge base in continual learning scenario
