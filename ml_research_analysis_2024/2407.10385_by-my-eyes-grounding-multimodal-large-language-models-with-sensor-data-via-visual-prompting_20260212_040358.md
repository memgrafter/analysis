# By My Eyes: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Sensor Data via Visual Prompting

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10385

- Primary result: Visual prompts improve accuracy by 10% and reduce token costs by 15.8× for sensor data analysis

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of using large language models for ubiquitous sensing applications, where long sensor data sequences in text prompts lead to performance degradation and high token costs. The proposed solution is to use visual prompting with multimodal LLMs by converting sensor data into visualized plots. A visualization generator automatically selects optimal visualizations for specific tasks. Experiments on nine sensory tasks across four sensor modalities showed that visual prompts improved accuracy by an average of 10% and reduced token costs by 15.8× compared to text-based prompts, demonstrating both effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method transforms sensor data sequences into visualized plots rather than text-based representations, enabling multimodal LLMs to process the information more efficiently. A visualization generator component automatically selects the most effective visualization method for each specific task by comparing different visualization options. The system then creates visual prompts that combine these visualizations with appropriate textual instructions and examples. The approach was evaluated using few-shot prompting with GPT-4o API across nine sensory tasks spanning accelerometer, ECG, EMG, and respiration data modalities.

## Key Results
- Visual prompts achieved 10% higher accuracy than text-based prompts on average
- Token costs reduced by 15.8× compared to text-based approaches
- Visualization generator successfully automated selection of optimal visualizations across diverse sensor modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual prompts reduce token costs by representing sensor data as images rather than long numeric sequences
- Mechanism: Converting numeric sensor sequences into visualized plots allows MLLMs to process the same information in a single image rather than thousands of tokens
- Core assumption: MLLMs can effectively interpret visual representations of sensor data patterns
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "reducing token costs by 15.8 times", [section 3] "Representing sensor data in textual format leads to extensive token usage, thereby increasing costs"
- Break condition: If MLLMs cannot effectively extract meaningful patterns from sensor data visualizations, the token reduction benefit disappears

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Visual prompts improve accuracy by leveraging MLLMs' pattern recognition capabilities
- Mechanism: MLLMs can identify visual patterns in sensor data plots more effectively than parsing long numeric sequences
- Core assumption: Visual pattern recognition is more effective than text-based numerical analysis for sensor data interpretation
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "achieving an average of 10% higher accuracy than text-based prompts", [section 3] "error rates consistently increased with the length" for numeric sequences
- Break condition: If sensor data patterns are too complex to visualize effectively, or if MLLMs lack sufficient visual reasoning capabilities

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The visualization generator automates optimal visualization selection for different sensory tasks
- Mechanism: MLLMs assess multiple visualization options and select the most effective one based on task requirements and visual data patterns
- Core assumption: MLLMs can evaluate the effectiveness of different visualizations for specific tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "introduces a visualization generator that automates the creation of optimal visualizations", [section 4.2] "Our visualization generator compares visualized images, consistently avoiding suboptimal choices"
- Break condition: If MLLMs cannot reliably distinguish between effective and ineffective visualizations for given tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
  - Why needed here: The entire approach relies on MLLMs' ability to process visual inputs alongside text
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between standard LLMs and MLLMs, and why vision capabilities matter for this work?

- Concept: Few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: The evaluation assumes users with no prior knowledge or resources for fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: What is few-shot prompting and how does it differ from zero-shot or fine-tuning approaches?

- Concept: Sensor data visualization techniques
  - Why needed here: Different sensor modalities require different visualization approaches (waveforms, spectrograms, etc.)
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when visualizing time-series sensor data, and how do they differ across accelerometer, ECG, EMG, and respiration data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visualization Generator -> Visual Prompt Designer -> MLLM Interface (GPT-4o API) -> Evaluation Pipeline
- Critical path: Visualization Generator → Visual Prompt → MLLM Processing → Task Output
- Design tradeoffs: Visualization complexity vs. interpretability, Token reduction vs. information completeness, Automation vs. manual optimization of visualizations
- Failure signatures: Poor accuracy despite visualization suggests ineffective visualization selection, High token usage suggests visualization is not properly compressing information, MLLM errors suggest limitations in visual reasoning capabilities
- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline comparison: Text-only prompt vs. visual prompt on simple activity recognition task, 2. Visualization generator test: Compare automated vs. manual visualization selection on ECG task, 3. Token efficiency test: Measure token reduction across different sensor modalities and data lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of visual prompts vary across different types of sensory tasks beyond classification, such as regression or anomaly detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on classification tasks and acknowledges limitations in handling tasks requiring numerical retrieval or precise computations.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to classification tasks, and the paper does not explore other task types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing visual prompts on regression or anomaly detection tasks would provide insights into their broader applicability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between visual and textual information in prompts for sensory data analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the visual prompt design does not incorporate Chain-of-Thought prompting and discusses the challenge of determining the optimal distribution of information between images and text.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a clear methodology for balancing visual and textual information, and the impact of this balance on performance is not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the ratio of visual to textual information in prompts and measuring performance would help identify the optimal balance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the visualization generator be improved to handle high-density, multi-channel sensor data like EEG?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations in visualizing high-density EEG data with 256 channels, noting that current methods are inadequate.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose solutions for effectively visualizing dense, multi-channel data, and the impact of this limitation on performance is not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new visualization techniques for high-density, multi-channel data and measuring their impact on MLLM performance would provide insights into potential improvements.

## Limitations
- The visualization generator's effectiveness depends heavily on the availability and quality of public visualization libraries
- The evaluation focuses on few-shot prompting without exploring fine-tuning options
- The study does not address real-time processing constraints or edge deployment scenarios

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The token reduction mechanism (15.8×) is well-supported by the fundamental difference between text-based and visual representations of sensor data
- Medium Confidence: The accuracy improvement claim (10% average) is plausible given MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities, but specific task performance may vary
- Medium Confidence: The visualization generator's automation benefits are demonstrated but may face limitations in handling novel or complex sensor patterns

## Next Checks

1. Test the visualization generator on edge cases with complex or noisy sensor data to evaluate its robustness and identify failure modes
2. Compare the few-shot visual prompting approach against fine-tuned models on representative tasks to quantify the performance trade-offs
3. Evaluate real-time processing latency and computational overhead for different sensor data visualization methods to assess practical deployment feasibility
