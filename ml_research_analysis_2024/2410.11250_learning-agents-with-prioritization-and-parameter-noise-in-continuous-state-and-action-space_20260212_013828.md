# Learning Agents With Prioritization and Parameter Noise in Continuous State and Action Space

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.11250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11250
- Reference count: 14
- PDDPG outperforms standard DDPG in most tested MuJoCo environments

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Prioritized DDPG (PDDPG), a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous state and action space problems. PDDPG combines Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with prioritized experience replay from Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The authors also explore adding parameter noise for exploration. Experiments on the MuJoCo physics simulator show that PDDPG outperforms standard DDPG in most tested environments, achieving higher rewards and learning faster.

## Method Summary
PDDPG integrates prioritized experience replay into DDPG by assigning higher sampling probabilities to transitions with larger temporal difference errors. Parameter noise is added to the actor network to improve exploration. The prioritization mechanism uses a sum-tree data structure for efficient sampling and updates. The algorithm maintains separate actors for exploration and learning, with the exploration actor perturbed by parameter noise.

## Key Results
- PDDPG outperformed standard DDPG in most tested MuJoCo environments
- Reached DDPG's final performance in fewer than 300 epochs on HalfCheetah
- Achieved significantly higher rewards on HumanoidStandup and Ant environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Prioritized replay focuses learning on high-error transitions, accelerating convergence. Parameter noise provides consistent exploration without the instability of action-space noise in deterministic policies. The combination addresses DDPG's slow learning and exploration challenges in continuous control tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **DDPG**: Actor-critic method for continuous control; needed as baseline algorithm
- **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Samples important transitions more frequently; needed to accelerate learning
- **Parameter Space Noise**: Adds noise directly to network parameters; needed for stable exploration in deterministic policies
- **Sum-tree data structure**: Enables efficient prioritized sampling; needed for computational feasibility
- **Temporal Difference Error**: Measures prediction error; needed for prioritization criterion
- **Soft target updates**: Stabilizes learning; needed to prevent divergence in actor-critic methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Actor Network -> Critic Network -> Replay Buffer (Prioritized) -> Target Networks

**Critical Path**
1. Actor selects action
2. Environment returns next state and reward
3. Critic estimates Q-value
4. TD error computed
5. Transition stored in prioritized replay buffer
6. Sample transitions based on priority
7. Update actor and critic
8. Soft update target networks

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Prioritized replay increases computation but improves sample efficiency
- Separate exploration and learning actors add memory overhead but stabilize training
- Parameter noise vs. action noise: parameter noise provides more consistent exploration

**Failure Signatures**
- Degraded performance if prioritization hyperparameter α is too high (overfitting to recent errors)
- Instability if β (correction factor) is too low (biased learning)
- Poor exploration if parameter noise magnitude is insufficient

**3 First Experiments**
1. Verify prioritized replay buffer sampling matches theoretical probabilities
2. Test parameter noise exploration on a simple continuous control task
3. Compare learning curves with and without prioritization on a basic MuJoCo environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benefits may not generalize beyond specific MuJoCo tasks tested
- Computational overhead of prioritized replay not quantified
- Limited discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity for prioritization parameters

## Confidence
- PDDPG outperforming standard DDPG in tested MuJoCo environments: **High**
- Claim that prioritization and parameter noise "improve" DDPG: **Medium**
- Generalization of benefits to other continuous control tasks: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Test PDDPG on a broader set of continuous control benchmarks (e.g., PyBullet, OpenAI Gym's newer environments) to assess generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of prioritization vs. parameter noise on final performance
3. Measure and report wall-clock training time to evaluate practical trade-offs of the prioritization mechanism
