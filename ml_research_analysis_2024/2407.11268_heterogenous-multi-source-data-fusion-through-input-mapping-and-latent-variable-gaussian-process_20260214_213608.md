# Heterogenous Multi-Source Data Fusion Through Input Mapping and Latent Variable Gaussian Process

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.11268
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11268
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Proposed framework improves predictive accuracy by 44.6% NRMSE reduction for low-data sources compared to source-unaware models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a two-stage framework for fusing multi-source data with heterogeneous input parameter spaces. The approach combines Input Mapping Calibration (IMC) to transform different input domains into a common reference space via linear mappings, followed by a Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) that builds a source-aware model on the transformed space. The framework learns latent variables that capture underlying similarities and differences between sources, enabling improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Three engineering case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach across cantilever beam design, ellipsoidal void modeling, and Ti6Al4V alloy manufacturing applications.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two stages: First, IMC transforms heterogeneous input domains from multiple sources into a unified reference parameter space using linear transformations (g(x_j, A, b) = Ax_j + b), optimized by minimizing prediction error against a reference source GP model. Second, LVGP builds a source-aware model on the transformed space by treating sources as categorical variables mapped to a 2D latent space, capturing source similarities/differences through learned latent variables. The LVGP uses maximum likelihood estimation to optimize both quantitative inputs and latent source representations, producing predictions with uncertainty quantification and a dissimilarity metric based on normalized Euclidean distances in the latent space.

## Key Results
- 44.6% NRMSE reduction for low-data sources compared to source-unaware models in Ti6Al4V case study
- Improved predictive accuracy across all three engineering case studies compared to both source-unaware GP models and single-source models
- Successful demonstration of latent space analysis providing interpretability of source relationships and quantification of source dissimilarity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Heterogeneous input mapping (IMC) enables multi-source fusion by projecting all input domains into a common reference space.
- **Mechanism:** IMC solves for a linear transformation matrix A and offset b such that inputs from source j are mapped to reference source i via `g(x_j, A, b) = A*x_j + b`. The transformation is optimized by minimizing output prediction error using the reference source's GP model.
- **Core assumption:** A linear transformation adequately approximates the true nonlinear mapping between input domains.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] states IMC is "utilized to transform the heterogeneous input parameter spaces into a unified reference parameter space."
  - [section 2.1.1] provides the formulation: `g(x; A, b) = Ax + b` with parameters estimated by minimizing mean squared loss.
  - [corpus] has no direct evidence of this transformation approach; the related works use different techniques like spectral transformation or deep GPs.
- **Break condition:** If the true mapping is highly nonlinear or the reference source lacks sufficient data, linear IMC will fail to adequately align domains.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** LVGP captures source-aware relationships by treating sources as categorical variables mapped to a low-dimensional latent space.
- **Mechanism:** LVGP introduces a categorical variable for sources and learns latent variables z(s) that encode the underlying quantitative space of each source. The correlation function `c(w, w')` incorporates both quantitative inputs and latent source representations.
- **Core assumption:** A 2D latent space is sufficient to represent source differences in the response.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] states LVGP "learns latent variables that capture underlying similarities/differences between sources."
  - [section 2.2.1] explains the latent space formulation: "a two-dimensional latent variable vector is sufficient to express the influence of the qualitative variables."
  - [corpus] supports this with the neighbor paper "Interpretable Multi-Source Data Fusion Through Latent Variable Gaussian Process" having the same approach.
- **Break condition:** If source differences require more than 2 dimensions to capture, the latent space will be insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dissimilarity metric quantifies source differences through Euclidean distance in latent space.
- **Mechanism:** The metric `D(zj) = ||zj - z*|| / ||zmax - z*||` normalizes the distance between source j and reference source z* by the maximum possible distance in the constrained latent space.
- **Core assumption:** Euclidean distance in the latent space correlates with actual differences in source behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] mentions the framework "quantifies source dissimilarity" through latent space analysis.
  - [section 2.2.1] provides the exact formula: `D(zj) = ||zj − z*|| / ||zmax − z*||`.
  - [corpus] lacks direct evidence of this specific metric formulation.
- **Break condition:** If the latent space doesn't capture the true source differences, the dissimilarity metric will be misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Gaussian Process Regression fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on GP modeling for both IMC reference models and LVGP source-aware modeling.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a GP model (mean function, covariance function, hyperparameters)?

- **Concept:** Transfer learning principles
  - Why needed here: The framework is fundamentally about transferring knowledge across heterogeneous data sources with different input spaces.
  - Quick check question: How does knowledge transfer differ between homogeneous and heterogeneous domains?

- **Concept:** Categorical variable handling in continuous models
  - Why needed here: LVGP treats sources as categorical variables that must be mapped to continuous latent spaces.
  - Quick check question: What are common approaches for incorporating categorical variables into regression models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data collection layer (multiple heterogeneous sources) -> IMC transformation engine (linear mapping optimization) -> Reference GP model (built on reference source) -> LVGP fusion model (source-aware with latent variables) -> Prediction interface (accepts any source input)
- **Critical path:** Data → IMC transformation → Reference GP training → LVGP fusion training → Prediction
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Linear vs. nonlinear mapping (simplicity vs. accuracy)
  - 2D vs. higher-dimensional latent space (interpretability vs. expressiveness)
  - Reference source selection (data quantity vs. relevance)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor transformation accuracy (high error in mapped source predictions)
  - Latent space collapse (all sources map to same region)
  - Overfitting to reference source (poor generalization to other sources)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement IMC on two simple synthetic sources with known linear relationship and verify transformation accuracy.
  2. Test LVGP on three sources with known hierarchical relationships and validate latent space captures this structure.
  3. Compare prediction accuracy of the full framework against single-source GP on a case with limited data in one source.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the proposed framework perform when the linear transformation in IMC is replaced with non-linear or kernel-based transformations, particularly for cases with highly non-overlapping input domains?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper mentions that the linear transformation was chosen to balance computational cost and robustness, and suggests that non-linear or kernel-based transformations could be explored as alternatives.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study only evaluates the linear transformation in IMC, leaving the performance of non-linear or kernel-based alternatives unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments demonstrating the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of non-linear or kernel-based transformations in IMC for cases with highly non-overlapping input domains.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the framework be extended to handle more than three sources of data, and how does its performance scale with increasing numbers of heterogeneous sources?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper demonstrates the framework with three case studies involving two to three sources, but does not explore scenarios with more than three sources or discuss scalability.
- **Why unresolved:** The scalability and performance of the framework with a larger number of heterogeneous sources remain untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Case studies or simulations with four or more heterogeneous sources, analyzing prediction accuracy, computational complexity, and interpretability as the number of sources increases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How sensitive is the framework to the choice of the reference source in IMC, and what criteria should be used to select the optimal reference source?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper selects the reference source based on the availability of the most data, but does not investigate the impact of this choice on model performance or discuss alternative selection criteria.
- **Why unresolved:** The influence of reference source selection on the accuracy and robustness of the framework is not examined.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing model performance when different sources are chosen as the reference, and the development of guidelines or metrics for optimal reference source selection.

## Limitations
- Linear IMC assumption may fail for highly nonlinear input domain relationships
- Reference source selection significantly impacts performance and optimal selection criteria are not established
- 2D latent space constraint may be insufficient for complex source relationships despite working well in tested cases

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The framework's core two-stage architecture (IMC + LVGP) is well-specified and the empirical results showing NRMSE improvements (44.6% for low-data source in Case Study 3) are directly supported by the presented data.
- **Medium confidence:** The linear IMC transformation mechanism is theoretically sound, but the lack of specific optimization details (GA parameters, convergence criteria) creates uncertainty about reproducibility.
- **Medium confidence:** The dissimilarity metric interpretation is valid, but the assumption that Euclidean distance in 2D latent space meaningfully captures source behavior differences needs more validation across diverse scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Sensitivity analysis:** Test the framework with different reference source selections to quantify the impact on overall performance and determine optimal reference source characteristics.

2. **Latent space dimensionality study:** Systematically evaluate LVGP performance with 1D, 2D, and 3D latent spaces on synthetic data with known source relationships to identify the optimal dimensionality tradeoff.

3. **Nonlinear mapping comparison:** Implement a nonlinear IMC variant (e.g., kernel-based transformation) and compare against the linear approach on datasets where nonlinear mappings are expected to improve alignment accuracy.
