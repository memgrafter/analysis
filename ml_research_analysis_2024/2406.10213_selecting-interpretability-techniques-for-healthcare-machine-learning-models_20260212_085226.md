# Selecting Interpretability Techniques for Healthcare Machine Learning models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10213
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10213
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of eight interpretability techniques for healthcare machine learning models, systematically classifying them according to five key characteristics for healthcare applications.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic overview of eight interpretability techniques for healthcare machine learning models, categorized into post-hoc (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, interactive reconstruction, influence functions) and model-based (GOSDT, RiskSLIM, ProtoPNet) approaches. The authors classify these methods according to their potential for healthcare applications based on five key characteristics: feature importance, descriptive accuracy, simulatability, relevance, and predictive accuracy. While no single method is presented as superior, the paper demonstrates practical applications including SHAP for prostate cancer mortality risk prediction, Grad-CAM for medical image analysis with 34% usage in MRI studies since 2017, and ProtoPNet for COVID-19 detection in X-ray scans achieving 87.27% accuracy. The authors recommend combining multiple interpretability techniques to mitigate individual limitations and create more robust, comprehensive solutions for healthcare AI applications.

## Method Summary
The paper systematically reviews and classifies eight interpretability techniques for healthcare machine learning models. The authors categorize methods into post-hoc approaches (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, interactive reconstruction, influence functions) and model-based approaches (GOSDT, RiskSLIM, ProtoPNet). Each technique is evaluated based on five key characteristics relevant to healthcare: feature importance, descriptive accuracy, simulatability, relevance, and predictive accuracy. The paper provides practical applications and examples for each technique, demonstrating their use in real healthcare scenarios. Rather than advocating for a single best method, the authors emphasize combining multiple techniques to address individual limitations and create more robust interpretability solutions.

## Key Results
- Eight interpretability techniques were categorized into post-hoc and model-based approaches for healthcare applications
- SHAP demonstrated effectiveness for prostate cancer mortality risk prediction
- Grad-CAM showed 34% usage in MRI studies since 2017 for medical image analysis
- ProtoPNet achieved 87.27% accuracy for COVID-19 detection in X-ray scans
- The authors recommend combining multiple interpretability techniques to mitigate individual flaws

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining multiple interpretability techniques mitigates individual flaws and creates more robust solutions.
- Mechanism: Different interpretability methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Post-hoc methods like LIME and SHAP provide feature importance but may struggle with local explanations, while model-based methods like ProtoPNet offer inherent interpretability but may sacrifice predictive accuracy. Combining approaches allows leveraging strengths while compensating for limitations.
- Core assumption: The limitations of individual interpretability methods are orthogonal rather than overlapping, making combination beneficial.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our strong recommendation is that combining these techniques can mitigate individual flaws and result in more robust and comprehensive interpretability solutions"
  - [section]: "no single method is without its shortcomings"
- Break condition: If the limitations of interpretability methods are not complementary but rather overlapping, combining approaches may not provide additional benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model-based interpretability approaches enhance transparency by constraining the model architecture during training.
- Mechanism: By designing models with inherent constraints (like sparse decision trees or risk scores), the resulting models are more interpretable by design, as their structure and decision-making process are more transparent and easier to understand.
- Core assumption: Constraining model architecture during training can maintain sufficient predictive performance while improving interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "High descriptive accuracy ML models can be achieved by training them to be inherently interpretable from the start, constraining the model's domain and minimization in a way that makes them more understandable to humans"
  - [section]: "Risk scores... empower users to assess risk through simple arithmetic operations"
- Break condition: If the constraints significantly reduce predictive accuracy below acceptable thresholds, the trade-off becomes unfavorable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gradient-based attribution methods are computationally efficient but sensitive to noise in attribution maps.
- Mechanism: These methods use backpropagation to calculate feature importance through gradients, requiring only a single forward and backward pass. However, they are vulnerable to noisy gradients that can produce misleading attribution maps.
- Core assumption: The computational efficiency of gradient-based methods justifies their use despite potential noise sensitivity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Gradient-based methods require a single forward and backward pass through the network to produce the attribution map"
  - [section]: "Gradient-based methods are strongly affected by noisy gradients"
- Break condition: If the noise in gradient-based attribution maps consistently produces misleading explanations, alternative methods should be preferred regardless of computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature importance and attribution methods
  - Why needed here: Understanding how individual features contribute to model predictions is fundamental to interpretability in healthcare applications
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between perturbation-based and gradient-based attribution methods?

- Concept: Post-hoc vs. model-based interpretability approaches
  - Why needed here: The paper categorizes interpretability techniques into these two approaches, each with different strengths and applications
  - Quick check question: What is the key distinction between post-hoc and model-based interpretability methods?

- Concept: Healthcare-specific interpretability requirements
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes the unique needs of healthcare applications, including feature importance, descriptive accuracy, simulatability, relevance, and predictive accuracy
  - Quick check question: According to the PDR framework, what are the five key characteristics of interpretable algorithms in healthcare?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The system consists of interpretability techniques categorized into post-hoc (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, interactive reconstruction, influence functions) and model-based (GOSDT, RiskSLIM, ProtoPNet) approaches. Each technique serves different interpretability needs in healthcare applications.

- Critical path: 1) Identify the specific interpretability need (feature importance, descriptive accuracy, etc.) 2) Select appropriate technique(s) based on the need 3) Apply technique to the model 4) Evaluate the interpretability results 5) Combine multiple techniques if needed for robustness

- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between predictive accuracy and interpretability. More interpretable models (like sparse decision trees) may sacrifice some accuracy, while highly accurate models (like deep neural networks) require post-hoc interpretation methods.

- Failure signatures: 1) Attribution maps that highlight irrelevant features 2) Explanations that don't align with domain knowledge 3) Models that are too complex to explain despite using interpretability techniques 4) Predictions that are accurate but based on spurious correlations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply SHAP to a simple healthcare classification model to understand feature importance and compare with domain expert knowledge
  2. Implement Grad-CAM on a medical image classification model and validate the highlighted regions with radiologist input
  3. Build a RiskSLIM model for a healthcare risk prediction task and evaluate the balance between interpretability and predictive performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does combining multiple interpretability techniques affect clinical decision-making accuracy and trust in healthcare settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our strong recommendation is that combining these techniques can mitigate individual flaws and result in more robust and comprehensive interpretability solutions"
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests combining techniques but doesn't provide empirical evidence of their combined impact on clinical outcomes or practitioner trust
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical studies comparing diagnostic accuracy and trust levels when using single vs. combined interpretability methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between interpretability and predictive accuracy for different healthcare applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses various methods with different trade-offs but doesn't establish guidelines for balancing these aspects across different medical scenarios
- Why unresolved: The paper presents multiple methods but doesn't provide a framework for determining when to prioritize interpretability over accuracy or vice versa
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of interpretability-predictive accuracy trade-offs across different medical domains and risk levels

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different healthcare professionals (e.g., radiologists vs. oncologists) perceive and utilize interpretability methods differently?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses interpretability in general healthcare contexts but doesn't explore domain-specific preferences or use cases
- Why unresolved: The paper treats healthcare professionals as a homogeneous group without examining specialty-specific needs or preferences
- What evidence would resolve it: Surveys and observational studies of different healthcare specialties using interpretability methods in practice

## Limitations
- The paper lacks empirical validation of interpretability techniques across diverse healthcare scenarios
- Specific applications are mentioned but lack detailed validation metrics and methodology descriptions
- The recommendation to combine interpretability techniques lacks systematic evaluation of which combinations work best
- The five key characteristics are defined but not quantitatively measured or compared across techniques

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of interpretability techniques into post-hoc and model-based approaches is well-established in the literature and aligns with standard ML interpretability frameworks.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific applications mentioned (SHAP for prostate cancer, Grad-CAM for MRI studies, ProtoPNet for COVID-19 detection) are plausible but lack detailed validation metrics and methodology descriptions.
- **Medium Confidence**: The recommendation to combine interpretability techniques is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation demonstrating its effectiveness across healthcare applications.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic experiments comparing the performance and limitations of individual interpretability techniques versus combined approaches across at least three distinct healthcare domains (e.g., imaging, tabular clinical data, and time-series monitoring).

2. Develop quantitative metrics to evaluate how well each interpretability technique satisfies the five key characteristics (feature importance, descriptive accuracy, simulatability, relevance, predictive accuracy) and use these to create evidence-based selection guidelines.

3. Validate the attribution maps and explanations generated by techniques like Grad-CAM and SHAP with domain experts (radiologists, clinicians) to assess clinical relevance and identify potential spurious correlations or misleading explanations.
