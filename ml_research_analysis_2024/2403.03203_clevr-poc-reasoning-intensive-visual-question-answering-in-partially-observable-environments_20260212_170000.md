# CLEVR-POC: Reasoning-Intensive Visual Question Answering in Partially Observable Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03203
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03203
- Authors: Savitha Sam Abraham; Marjan Alirezaie; Luc De Raedt
- Reference count: 0
- Pre-trained models like CLIP (~22%) and GPT-4 (~46%) perform poorly on CLEVR-POC

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CLEVR-POC, a novel dataset for reasoning-intensive visual question answering in partially observable environments. The dataset requires leveraging logical constraints to generate plausible answers about hidden objects in scenes. Experiments show that pre-trained vision-language models and large language models perform poorly on CLEVR-POC, highlighting the need for frameworks that can handle reasoning with environment-specific background knowledge. A neuro-symbolic model integrating GPT-4 with visual perception networks and formal logical reasoners achieves exceptional performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning systems.

## Method Summary
The authors propose CLEVR-POC, a dataset designed to test reasoning capabilities in partially observable environments. They develop a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines a visual perception network (Detectron-based) to generate scene graphs, a question parser (either BiLSTM or GPT-4) to convert questions into ASP programs, and an ASP solver to perform constraint satisfaction. The approach is evaluated against baselines including CLIP-based vision-language models and GPT-4 alone, demonstrating significant performance improvements through neuro-symbolic integration.

## Key Results
- CLIP achieves only ~22% accuracy on CLEVR-POC, showing limited capability in reasoning with environmental constraints
- GPT-4 alone achieves ~46% accuracy, significantly better than CLIP but still far from optimal performance
- The neuro-symbolic model integrating GPT-4 with visual perception and ASP solving achieves exceptional performance on CLEVR-POC
- The performance gap demonstrates the need for frameworks that can incorporate environment-specific background knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Neuro-symbolic integration enables reasoning by converting raw inputs into symbolic representations that formal reasoners can process.
- **Mechanism:** The neuro-symbolic model uses a visual perception network to convert images into scene graphs and a language model to convert questions into ASP programs, which are then processed by a formal ASP solver alongside environmental constraints.
- **Core assumption:** Scene graphs and ASP programs accurately capture all relevant information from images and questions for reasoning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "our demonstration illustrates that a neuro-symbolic model, which integrates an LLM like GPT-4 with a visual perception network and a formal logical reasoner, exhibits exceptional performance on CLEVR-POC."
  - [section 4.1.2] "The architecture is based on the state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic approach on the CLEVR dataset, NS-VQA (Yi et al., 2018) and will be used here to study aspects of RQ2."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Large language models can generate accurate symbolic representations when given appropriate prompts, avoiding the need to learn symbolic reasoning from scratch.
- **Mechanism:** GPT-4 is used as a question parser, converting natural language questions directly into ASP programs using few-shot prompting with examples.
- **Core assumption:** GPT-4 has sufficient understanding of ASP syntax and semantics to generate valid programs from natural language.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.3] "The model is provided with just 28 (question, ASP program) pairs of examples as prompts. GPT-4 with no fine tuning was able to accurately predict the equivalent ASP programs."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** CLEVR-POC's environment-specific constraints make it difficult for pre-trained models to perform well without specialized reasoning capabilities.
- **Mechanism:** Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP and LLMs like GPT-4 struggle because they cannot incorporate environment-specific logical constraints during inference.
- **Core assumption:** Environmental constraints are not represented in the training data of these models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "pre-trained vision language models like CLIP (~ 22%) and large language models like GPT-4 (~ 46%) perform poorly on CLEVR-POC"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Answer Set Programming (ASP)
  - Why needed here: ASP is used to represent both environmental constraints and questions in a formal logic format that can be processed by reasoning engines.
  - Quick check question: Can you write a simple ASP rule that states "All cups are either red, green, or blue"?

- **Concept:** Neuro-symbolic integration
  - Why needed here: The task requires combining neural perception (image and question understanding) with symbolic reasoning (constraint satisfaction).
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of the neuro-symbolic architecture described in this paper?

- **Concept:** Constraint satisfaction and eliminative induction
  - Why needed here: The task involves using constraints to eliminate impossible answers and find all consistent solutions for hidden objects.
  - Quick check question: Given the constraint "There are exactly two red cups," and observing one red cup, what can you deduce about the hidden cup's color?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Image → Scene graph → ASP representation → Constraint satisfaction → Answer
  Question → ASP representation → Constraint satisfaction → Answer

- **Critical path:** Visual perception network → Question parser → ASP solver → Answer generation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using pre-trained models (GPT-4) vs training from scratch for question parsing
  - ASP vs natural language for representing constraints
  - Accuracy of visual perception vs reasoning capabilities

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low exact accuracy indicates problems with constraint satisfaction or symbolic representation
  - Low Jaccard index suggests partial but incomplete reasoning
  - High visual perception errors cascade to reasoning failures

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test ASP solver with known scene graphs and questions to verify reasoning capability
  2. Test question parser with simple questions to verify ASP generation accuracy
  3. Test full pipeline with synthetic data where ground truth is known

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The visual perception network's accuracy directly impacts reasoning quality, with no detailed error analysis provided
- Reliance on GPT-4 for ASP program generation may not generalize to more complex constraint sets or diverse question types
- Dataset focus on specific constraint types may limit broader applicability to real-world scenarios with more dynamic logical relationships

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The fundamental premise that CLEVR-POC presents a challenging reasoning task requiring constraint satisfaction is well-supported by the significant performance gap between baseline models and the neuro-symbolic approach.
- **Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of using GPT-4 as a question parser for ASP generation is demonstrated but not extensively validated across diverse question types and constraint structures.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that pre-trained models struggle specifically due to inability to incorporate environment-specific constraints is plausible but could benefit from ablation studies isolating this factor.

## Next Checks
1. **Error Analysis Pipeline:** Conduct systematic error analysis to identify where failures occur in the neuro-symbolic pipeline (visual perception errors, ASP generation errors, or ASP solving errors) to better understand model limitations.

2. **Generalization Testing:** Test the GPT-4 question parser with expanded constraint types and more complex logical relationships not present in the current CLEVR-POC dataset to assess true generalization capability.

3. **Real-world Transfer:** Apply the CLEVR-POC framework to a real-world partially observable environment (such as robotics or surveillance scenarios) to evaluate whether the demonstrated reasoning capabilities transfer beyond synthetic data.
