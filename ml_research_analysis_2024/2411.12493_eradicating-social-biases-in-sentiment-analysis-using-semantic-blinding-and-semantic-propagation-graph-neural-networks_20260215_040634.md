# Eradicating Social Biases in Sentiment Analysis using Semantic Blinding and Semantic Propagation Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.12493
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12493
- Reference count: 21
- Introduces SProp GNN to reduce social bias in sentiment analysis through semantic blinding

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Semantic Propagation Graph Neural Network (SProp GNN) to address social bias in sentiment analysis. By semantically blinding the model to specific word information and relying on syntactic structures and word-level emotional cues, SProp GNN avoids inheriting political, gender, and other social biases from training data. Across two languages and two prediction tasks, SProp GNN outperformed lexicon-based methods like VADER and EmoAtlas and approached transformer-level accuracy. Statistical tests confirmed it propagated significantly less bias than transformer models, making it a robust, interpretable alternative for fair and effective emotion analysis in text.

## Method Summary
The SProp GNN approach uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) word-level emotion prediction using transformer-based norm extrapolation models, (2) syntactic graph creation with spaCy dependency parsing, and (3) SProp GNN with custom Semantic Propagation layer, attention pooling, and linear output layers. The model processes text by creating dependency graphs where words are nodes and relationships are edges, then propagates emotional information through these structures without access to actual word identities. This semantic blinding prevents the model from associating specific words with emotional predictions, reducing bias propagation while maintaining competitive accuracy.

## Key Results
- SProp GNN outperformed lexicon-based methods (VADER, EmoAtlas) and approached transformer-level accuracy
- Statistical tests confirmed SProp GNN propagated significantly less political and gender bias than transformer models
- The approach was validated across two languages (English and Polish) and two prediction tasks (discrete emotions and continuous valence/arousal)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semantic blinding prevents the model from associating specific words with emotional predictions, reducing bias propagation.
- Mechanism: By processing only syntactic structures and word-level emotional cues without access to actual word identities, the model cannot overfit to biased word-concept associations present in training data.
- Core assumption: Emotional information can be accurately propagated through syntactic relationships without knowing the specific words involved.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By semantically blinding the model to information about specific words, it is robust to biases such as political or gender bias"
  - [section]: "Through comparative experiments, this paper demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms traditional lexicon-based models"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors discuss bias in GNNs and VLMs but don't directly address semantic blinding
- Break condition: If syntactic structures alone cannot capture sufficient emotional nuance for accurate predictions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The SProp GNN layer learns to scale emotional information propagation based on syntactic dependencies.
- Mechanism: The custom SProp layer computes scaling factors for edges between nodes based on POS tags, edge types, and node features, allowing it to model how emotions propagate through sentence structure.
- Core assumption: Syntactic relationships between words contain sufficient information to determine how emotional content should be modified or propagated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "relies exclusively on syntactic structures and word-level emotional cues"
  - [section]: "propagates the emotional information from word nodes along those edges, scaling them accordingly"
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbors discuss GNN bias but not specific scaling mechanisms for emotional propagation
- Break condition: If the scaling factors learned by the model don't capture meaningful patterns of emotional modification

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Attention pooling identifies and weighs the most relevant words for emotional prediction.
- Mechanism: After graph processing, an attention mechanism assigns different weights to word nodes based on their relevance, focusing on significant words and relationships for overall text representation.
- Core assumption: Some words carry more emotional weight than others, and the model can learn to identify these through attention mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "attention-based pooling mechanism"
  - [section]: "assigns different weights to word nodes based on their relevance"
  - [corpus]: Missing - corpus doesn't contain evidence about attention mechanisms in this specific context
- Break condition: If attention weights don't meaningfully correlate with words that actually carry emotional content

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: The SProp GNN processes syntactic dependency graphs where words are nodes and relationships are edges
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how messages propagate through a graph neural network in one sentence?

- Concept: Syntactic dependency parsing
  - Why needed here: The model relies on accurate syntactic structures to create the graphs it processes
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between a subject and object dependency in a sentence?

- Concept: Word-level emotion prediction
  - Why needed here: The model requires emotional scores for individual words before processing through the GNN
  - Quick check question: How would you handle words that have multiple possible emotional meanings depending on context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Word Level Emotion Prediction -> Syntactic Graph Creation -> SProp GNN -> Output layers
- Critical path: Word → Graph → SProp layer → Attention pooling → Linear layers → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Blinding to words vs. performance: Model sacrifices direct word access for bias reduction
  - Single SProp layer vs. deeper architecture: Simplicity chosen over potential performance gains
  - Attention pooling vs. other aggregation: Balances interpretability with effectiveness
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on negation-heavy sentences: Model may not fully capture negation scope
  - Inconsistent predictions across similar structures: Attention mechanism may not be learning properly
  - Bias still present in predictions: Semantic blinding may not be working as intended
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on simple sentences with clear emotional content to verify basic functionality
  2. Test on sentences with negations to verify negation handling
  3. Compare predictions on politically charged vs. neutral sentences with same syntactic structure to verify bias reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the SProp GNN model maintain its bias robustness when trained on datasets from non-Western languages or cultures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current study tested the model on English and Polish datasets, which are both Indo-European languages from European cultures. The paper does not explore how the model performs with languages from different language families or cultural contexts.
- Why unresolved: The study did not include languages from different language families or cultural backgrounds, limiting the generalizability of the bias robustness findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the SProp GNN on datasets from diverse languages (e.g., Mandarin, Arabic, Swahili) and cultural contexts, followed by bias analysis similar to the political bias study, would demonstrate whether the model's bias mitigation capabilities extend beyond Western languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the SProp GNN model change when using different syntactic parsing tools or methods for graph creation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using spaCy for syntactic parsing but does not explore the impact of using alternative parsing tools or methods on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The study utilized a single syntactic parsing tool without comparing it to other available options, leaving uncertainty about whether the choice of parsing tool affects the model's effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the SProp GNN's performance using different syntactic parsing tools (e.g., Stanford CoreNLP, Berkeley Neural Parser) or methods would reveal whether the choice of parser influences the model's accuracy and bias mitigation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the long-term impact of the SProp GNN model's bias mitigation on downstream applications in real-world settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper demonstrates reduced bias in controlled experiments, it does not investigate how this bias mitigation affects outcomes in practical applications over time.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on immediate performance and bias reduction but does not track the model's performance and fairness in real-world deployments over extended periods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies applying the SProp GNN in various real-world settings (e.g., mental health monitoring, content moderation) and monitoring outcomes over time would provide insights into the sustained impact of its bias mitigation.

## Limitations
- The semantic blinding approach may sacrifice some performance compared to fully word-aware models
- Implementation details of the custom SProp layer remain somewhat opaque, making exact replication challenging
- The study tested only two languages and two prediction tasks, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- Claims about bias reduction: Medium-High
- Claims about competitive accuracy: Medium
- Claims about architectural innovations: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test SProp GNN on additional languages and emotion datasets to assess cross-domain robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the semantic blinding component to quantify the exact bias-performance tradeoff
3. Implement and compare alternative graph neural network architectures (e.g., GAT, GCN) with semantic blinding to determine if SProp's specific design is optimal
