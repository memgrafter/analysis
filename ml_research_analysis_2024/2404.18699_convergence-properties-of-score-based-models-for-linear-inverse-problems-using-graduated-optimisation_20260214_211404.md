# Convergence Properties of Score-Based Models for Linear Inverse Problems Using Graduated Optimisation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18699
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18699
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Proposed method outperforms traditional gradient descent in CT reconstruction using PSNR and SSIM metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of solving non-convex optimization problems that arise when incorporating generative models as regularizers in variational formulations for inverse problems. The authors propose using score-based generative models (SGMs) within a graduated optimization framework to tackle these problems. They show that the resulting graduated non-convexity flow converges to stationary points of the original problem. The proposed method is evaluated on a 2D toy example and computed tomography image reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework can recover high-quality images, independent of the initial value, and outperforms traditional gradient descent methods in terms of both PSNR and SSIM metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes using score-based generative models within a graduated optimization framework to solve inverse problems. The method involves training an SGM on the target data distribution, then using it as a regularizer in a variational formulation. The optimization is performed using a graduated non-convexity flow with an adaptive smoothing schedule, where the largest smoothing parameter is selected that ensures a descent direction. The paper also introduces an energy-based parametrization of the SGM to enable adaptive step sizes while maintaining convergence guarantees. The method is evaluated on 2D toy examples and CT image reconstruction tasks using PSNR and SSIM metrics.

## Key Results
- The graduated non-convexity flow with adaptive smoothing schedule converges to stationary points of the original inverse problem
- The proposed method recovers high-quality images independent of initialization
- Outperforms traditional gradient descent methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics for CT reconstruction tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graduated non-convexity flow with adaptive smoothing schedule converges to stationary points of the original inverse problem
- Mechanism: Uses SGMs as an embedding to create a sequence of progressively smoothed objective functions. In each iteration, the largest smoothing parameter is selected that ensures a descent direction, guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point.
- Core assumption: The gradient-like directions property holds with adaptive smoothing, and the score function's Lipschitz continuity ensures bounded descent steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that the resulting graduated non-convexity flow converge to stationary points of the original problem"
  - [section] "Under these conditions every limit point of iterates produced by a gradient-like algorithm is a stationary point of f"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related work on convergence in infinite-dimensional settings but no direct empirical validation provided
- Break condition: If the adaptive smoothing schedule fails to find a descent direction, or if the score function's Lipschitz constant is infinite, convergence cannot be guaranteed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Energy-based parametrization enables adaptive step sizes while maintaining convergence guarantees
- Mechanism: Replaces score function with energy-based model where the gradient of the energy approximates the score. This allows direct evaluation of the objective function, enabling line search methods for step size selection.
- Core assumption: The normalization constant Z(θ,t) can be ignored for step size computation since only additive constants matter for descent direction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Energy-based parametrisation was used in a similar fashion to compute Metropolis correction probabilities [19]"
  - [abstract] "Experimental results demonstrate that the framework can recover high-quality images, independent of the initial value"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related work on energy-based diffusion models but no direct comparison to score-based methods provided
- Break condition: If the energy-based approximation of the score is poor, step sizes may be inappropriate and convergence could fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-trained SGMs provide effective regularizers for inverse problems, independent of initialization
- Mechanism: SGMs learn a sequence of gradually perturbed distributions that approximate the data distribution. When used as regularizers in variational formulations, they guide optimization away from poor local minima.
- Core assumption: The learned score function accurately approximates the true score of the data distribution, and the perturbation schedule ensures convexity at high noise levels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This framework is able to recover high-quality images, independent of the initial value"
  - [section] "We show that score-based generative models (SGMs) can be used in a graduated optimisation framework to solve inverse problems"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work on score-based diffusion models for inverse problems but limited empirical validation
- Break condition: If the SGM is poorly trained or the perturbation schedule is inappropriate, the regularizer may not effectively guide optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Score-based generative models and denoising score matching
  - Why needed here: SGMs provide the learned regularizer that makes the non-convex optimization tractable
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the score function and the log-likelihood in the SGM framework?

- Concept: Graduated optimization and continuation methods
  - Why needed here: These methods provide the theoretical framework for transforming a non-convex problem into a sequence of convex problems
  - Quick check question: How does the smoothing parameter schedule affect the convergence properties of graduated optimization?

- Concept: Gradient-like methods and sufficient descent conditions
  - Why needed here: These methods provide the theoretical guarantees for convergence to stationary points in non-convex optimization
  - Quick check question: What conditions must a descent direction satisfy to guarantee convergence in gradient-like methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Forward operator A → Data fit term → Regularization term (S/GBM) → Optimization loop with adaptive smoothing
- Critical path: Forward operator → Regularization (S/GBM) → Objective evaluation → Step size selection → Parameter update
- Design tradeoffs: Energy-based parametrization enables adaptive step sizes but increases computational cost compared to score-based methods
- Failure signatures: Poor reconstructions, oscillations in objective value, step sizes varying by orders of magnitude
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement 2D toy example with known analytical score to verify convergence properties
  2. Compare fixed vs adaptive step sizes on small CT dataset
  3. Test initialization sensitivity by varying starting points in high-dimensional inverse problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed method of using score-based generative models (SGMs) in graduated optimisation frameworks consistently outperform traditional gradient descent methods across different types of inverse problems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms traditional gradient descent methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics for computed tomography image reconstruction tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides experimental results for computed tomography image reconstruction tasks. It is unclear whether the method would perform similarly well on other types of inverse problems, such as deblurring, inpainting, or super-resolution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further experimental evaluations on a diverse set of inverse problems would help determine the general applicability and performance of the proposed method.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the forward SDE (e.g., drift function f and diffusion function g) in the SGM framework affect the convergence properties and reconstruction quality of the proposed method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the SGM framework consists of a predefined forward process, during which noise is gradually added, and a learnable reverse process. However, it does not explore the impact of different choices for the forward SDE on the method's performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a specific choice of the forward SDE (VPSDE) and does not investigate how alternative choices might affect the convergence and reconstruction quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental comparisons of the proposed method using different forward SDE choices (e.g., variance-exploding SDE, variance-preserving SDE) would help understand the sensitivity of the method to the forward process.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed method effectively handle high-dimensional inverse problems, such as 3D medical imaging or video reconstruction, and what are the computational challenges associated with scaling up the approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents experimental results on 2D computed tomography image reconstruction tasks. However, it does not discuss the applicability of the method to high-dimensional inverse problems.
- Why unresolved: High-dimensional inverse problems pose additional challenges in terms of computational complexity, memory requirements, and the need for larger training datasets. The paper does not address these challenges or provide insights into the scalability of the proposed method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental evaluations of the proposed method on high-dimensional inverse problems, along with a discussion of the computational challenges and potential solutions, would help assess the scalability and practicality of the approach.

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence guarantees rely on idealized conditions that may not hold in practice
- Limited empirical validation with only 2D toy examples and CT reconstruction tasks
- Energy-based parametrization introduces additional computational overhead not quantified in the paper

## Confidence
- High confidence: The basic premise that SGMs can regularize inverse problems is well-established in related literature
- Medium confidence: The convergence properties of the graduated non-convexity flow with adaptive smoothing are theoretically sound but lack extensive empirical validation
- Low confidence: The practical benefits of energy-based parametrization over direct score-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and computational efficiency

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic experiments across diverse inverse problems (e.g., MRI, deblurring) to assess generalizability beyond CT reconstruction
2. Perform ablation studies comparing fixed vs adaptive step sizes and score-based vs energy-based parametrizations
3. Evaluate computational complexity and runtime trade-offs between the proposed method and baseline approaches
