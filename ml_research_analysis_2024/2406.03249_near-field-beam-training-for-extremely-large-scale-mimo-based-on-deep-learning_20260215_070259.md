# Near-field Beam training for Extremely Large-scale MIMO Based on Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.03249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03249
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Proposed deep learning method achieves stable beamforming gain and outperforms traditional methods in near-field ELAA systems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the high beam training overhead problem in extremely large-scale MIMO (ELAA) systems operating in the near-field region. The authors propose a deep learning-based beamforming method that uses a convolutional neural network to learn channel characteristics from historical data. The network outputs beamforming vectors directly from channel state information without requiring predefined codebooks. Experimental results show the proposed scheme achieves stable beamforming gain and significantly outperforms traditional beam training methods, particularly at high signal-to-noise ratios and near-field distances.

## Method Summary
The method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with complex number feature extraction to perform near-field beamforming. The CNN takes stacked real and imaginary parts of channel state information (CSI) as input, processes them through convolutional layers with careful padding and kernel size design to preserve phase information, and outputs beamforming vectors via a Tanh layer constrained to unit modulus. The loss function is defined as the negative of the achievable rate, enabling unsupervised learning that directly optimizes beamforming performance without requiring a codebook. The approach is evaluated on synthetic near-field channel data with 256 transmit antennas at 50GHz carrier frequency.

## Key Results
- The proposed CNN-based beamforming method achieves stable performance across different SNR levels
- Significant performance improvements over traditional hierarchical and exhaustive search methods
- Superior performance particularly at high SNRs and near-field distances (5-50m range)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The CNN extracts phase information between real and imaginary parts by using vertical stacking and maintaining their correlation through padding and kernel size.
- Mechanism: Real and imaginary parts of the channel state information are stacked vertically into a 2xNt structure, then passed through convolutional layers with padding=1 and kernel size (2,2) to preserve the phase correlation between the two components.
- Core assumption: The phase information between real and imaginary parts is crucial for accurate beamforming and can be effectively captured through convolutional feature extraction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Diverging from the conventional approach of concatenating real and imaginary parts into a one-dimensional vector, this paper adopts vertical stacking and utilizes a convolutional neural network for information extraction. The key benefit of this processing method is its ability to preserve the correlation information between the real and imaginary parts, particularly the phase information."
  - [section] "With meticulously designed padding and convolution kernel size, we ensure that the data size remains unchanged before and after passing through the feature extraction block, as outlined in the red dashed box."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The tanh layer constrains the beamforming vector modulus to 1 by outputting phase angles that are then converted to complex numbers via Euler's formula.
- Mechanism: The final tanh activation outputs values in [-1,1], which are scaled by π to produce phase angles in [-π,π]. These phases are then converted to complex numbers using Euler's formula, ensuring the resulting beamforming vector has unit modulus.
- Core assumption: The tanh layer can effectively learn to output optimal phase values that maximize the achievable rate when converted to complex beamforming vectors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To ensure that the neural network's output is a complex-valued vector adhering to the norm constraint, a 'tanh' layer is introduced at the final layer of the network. Specifically, its output is a real value denoted as θ, and after passing through the 'tanh' activation layer, its value is confined to the range (0, 1)."
  - [section] "Multiplying the output by π yields the phase within the range of [-π, π]."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Unsupervised learning with achievable rate as the loss function enables codebook-free beamforming by directly optimizing the network to maximize system performance.
- Mechanism: The loss function is defined as the negative of the average achievable rate across all users, which the network minimizes during training. This drives the network to learn beamforming vectors that maximize the rate without requiring a predefined codebook.
- Core assumption: The negative achievable rate is a suitable loss function that the neural network can effectively minimize to find good beamforming solutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We adopt an unsupervised learning approach, where the neural network is guided by a loss function directly linked to the beamforming target. The loss function for the task is defined as the negative of the average achievable rate."
  - [section] "By minimizing this loss function, the neural network will tend to increase the achievable rate of the system."

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CSI → CNN feature extraction → FC layer → Tanh → Complex vector → Achievable rate → Loss backprop

- Critical path: CSI → CNN feature extraction → FC layer → Tanh → Complex vector → Achievable rate → Loss backprop

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Vertical stacking vs concatenation: Preserves phase correlation but may require more complex CNN architecture
  - Tanh layer vs other activation functions: Ensures unit modulus but may limit phase range
  - Achievable rate loss vs other metrics: Directly optimizes performance but may be harder to optimize

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence: May indicate issues with loss function or network architecture
  - Low beamforming gain: Could be due to insufficient feature extraction or suboptimal phase learning
  - High variance in performance: Might suggest overfitting or sensitivity to noise

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the CNN's ability to extract features from complex CSI by comparing performance with and without the CNN layers
  2. Evaluate the impact of the tanh layer by comparing models with and without it
  3. Compare the proposed scheme's performance with traditional codebook-based methods across different SNR levels and distances

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using CNNs for feature extraction from complex channel state information through vertical stacking is well-supported by the architectural description and the rationale provided. The mathematical framework for converting tanh outputs to phase-constrained beamforming vectors via Euler's formula is clearly specified and theoretically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the negative achievable rate as a loss function for unsupervised learning is theoretically justified but would require extensive empirical validation across diverse channel conditions and user distributions to confirm general applicability.

**Low Confidence**: The claimed superiority over traditional methods (hierarchical and exhaustive search) is based on the presented simulations, but the specific performance gains at different SNR levels and distances would need independent verification with the complete implementation details to establish robust confidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Architectural Reproducibility Test**: Implement the CNN architecture with the specified feature extraction blocks and padding configurations, then verify that the network can successfully extract features from vertically stacked real and imaginary CSI components while maintaining the input dimensions through the convolutional layers.

2. **Phase Constraint Validation**: Test the Tanh layer's ability to learn optimal phase values by comparing the beamforming performance of models with and without the phase constraint, and verify that the learned phases translate to improved achievable rates across different SNR levels.

3. **Cross-Scenario Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the proposed scheme's performance against traditional methods across a broader range of scenarios, including different antenna array geometries, carrier frequencies outside the 30-60GHz range, and varying numbers of users beyond the K=3 case studied in the paper.
