- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: End-to-end pipeline that automatically generates posters from long multimodal documents, outperforming baselines in ROUGE metrics, multimodal summarization metrics, and human evaluation while being faster and more cost-effective.

## Executive Summary
PostDoc presents an innovative end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating posters from long multimodal documents. The core innovation is a deep submodular function that explicitly ensures coverage, diversity, and multimodal alignment in the extracted summary. This is trained using ground truth summaries and combined with a pre-trained multimodal model (BLIP) to encode text and images into a common space. The pipeline uses a greedy algorithm for content selection, GPT-3.5-turbo for paraphrasing, and a heuristic-based template generation module for font, color, and layout selection.

## Method Summary
PostDoc extracts multimodal content from documents, encodes it using BLIP embeddings, and applies a deep submodular function trained on ground truth summaries to select content that optimizes coverage, diversity, and alignment. The selected content is paraphrased using GPT-3.5-turbo and inserted into a generated template with suitable design elements. The template generation module outperforms baselines in font and layout selection using a fine-tuned MiniLM for fonts and heuristic rules for layout generation.

## Key Results
- PostDoc outperforms baseline methods in ROUGE metrics (L/1/2) and multimodal summarization metrics (coverage, diversity, image precision)
- Template generation module achieves nearly twice the score of LayoutDM in layout quality metrics
- The pipeline is faster and more cost-effective than baseline approaches
- Strong performance on both standard benchmarks and out-of-domain testing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep submodular function with trainable weights improves multimodal summary quality over non-trainable baselines.
- Mechanism: The deep submodular function explicitly optimizes coverage, diversity, and multimodal alignment by jointly learning feature importance weights across dimensions. This is trained on ground truth summaries, allowing the model to capture hidden properties not explicitly defined.
- Core assumption: The submodular function properties (diminishing returns) are preserved when extended with trainable weights, enabling effective greedy optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a novel deep submodular function which can be trained on ground truth summaries to extract multimodal content from the document and explicitly ensures good coverage, diversity and alignment of text and images."
  - [section]: Theorem 3.1 proves the set function is monotone submodular, enabling greedy optimization with approximation guarantee.
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus. The claim relies on the theoretical proof and experimental results.
- Break condition: If the submodular property is lost due to the deep parameterization, the greedy algorithm may no longer provide approximation guarantees.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: L1-normalization and shifting of BLIP embeddings to positive coordinates ensures comparable scale across text and image modalities.
- Mechanism: Without normalization, text and image embeddings from BLIP may be on different scales, causing one modality to dominate similarity calculations. L1-normalization and positive shift ensures fair contribution from both modalities.
- Core assumption: BLIP embeddings for text and images are not naturally on the same scale, necessitating normalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We have observed that the embeddings of text and images are often not in the same scale. To overcome this issue, we first shift all the embeddings to positive coordinate of the embedding space and do a L1 normalization of the embeddings."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus. The claim is based on empirical observation during implementation.
- Break condition: If BLIP embeddings are already on comparable scales, normalization may distort meaningful differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Heuristic-based layout generation conditioned on content achieves better aesthetic metrics than learned approaches like LayoutDM.
- Mechanism: The heuristic approach directly encodes design principles (image-left, text-right, fixed text width, adaptive image width) and scales better with content complexity, avoiding overlap issues seen in learned approaches.
- Core assumption: Learned layout models like LayoutDM struggle with poster-specific constraints and scale poorly with varying content complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our layout generation module, which relies on heuristics, achieves a score that is almost twice the score achieved by LayoutDM."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus. The claim is based on experimental results comparing to LayoutDM.
- Break condition: If the heuristic rules are too rigid, they may fail to produce optimal layouts for certain content distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Submodular functions and their properties (monotonicity, diminishing returns)
  - Why needed here: The core optimization problem relies on submodular properties to enable efficient greedy approximation algorithms.
  - Quick check question: What is the key property that allows greedy algorithms to achieve approximation guarantees for submodular maximization?

- Concept: Multimodal embeddings and their normalization
  - Why needed here: Proper embedding representation is critical for the submodular function to capture multimodal coverage and alignment.
  - Quick check question: Why might text and image embeddings from the same model require different normalization approaches?

- Concept: Template generation principles (font selection, color theory, layout balance)
  - Why needed here: The template generation module must produce aesthetically pleasing posters that complement the content.
  - Quick check question: What are the key design principles that guide the heuristic layout generation approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Document extraction -> Multimodal encoding -> Deep submodular summarization -> Content paraphrasing -> Template generation (font, color, layout) -> Poster output

- Critical path:
  Extract document content -> Encode with BLIP -> Run deep submodular optimization -> Paraphrase with GPT-3.5 -> Generate template -> Combine content and template

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Submodular function complexity vs. greedy optimization efficiency
  - Template generation heuristics vs. learned approaches (better aesthetics vs. flexibility)
  - Single GPT-3.5 call for paraphrasing vs. multiple calls for chunk processing (speed vs. context handling)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor coverage/diversity metrics -> Submodular function weights not learning properly
  - Unaligned text and images -> Embedding normalization issue or multimodal alignment term not working
  - Cluttered layouts -> Heuristic layout generation rules too rigid for given content

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test submodular function on synthetic multimodal data with known ground truth to verify coverage/diversity metrics
  2. Compare embedding normalization strategies (L1 vs. L2 vs. no normalization) on multimodal similarity tasks
  3. Evaluate template generation with varying numbers of content elements to stress-test layout heuristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the deep submodular function's performance compare to other optimization approaches, such as reinforcement learning or other differentiable subset selection methods, when trained on larger datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that PostDoc outperforms baselines on ROUGE metrics and mentions that the deep submodular function is trained on 9000 samples from the MSMO dataset. However, it does not compare to other optimization approaches like reinforcement learning or other differentiable subset selection methods, especially on larger datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparison with other optimization approaches, particularly on larger datasets, which could reveal if the deep submodular function is the optimal choice for multimodal summarization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing PostDoc's deep submodular function to other optimization approaches, such as reinforcement learning or other differentiable subset selection methods, on larger datasets with varying multimodal content would provide insights into its relative performance and scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does PostDoc handle documents with a high proportion of non-natural images, such as flow-charts, diagrams, and tables, and what are the specific challenges in processing these elements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions that PostDoc's performance is limited for non-natural images such as flow-charts and neural diagrams, as well as other structured elements like tables. It also states that fine-tuning VLMs on documents containing such elements is planned as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis or results on how PostDoc handles documents with a high proportion of non-natural images or structured elements. The specific challenges and potential solutions for processing these elements are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on datasets with a high proportion of non-natural images and structured elements, analyzing the specific challenges faced by PostDoc, and proposing and evaluating potential solutions for processing these elements would provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements of the model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is PostDoc's performance to the choice of the fixed size K for the extracted summary, and what are the optimal strategies for determining K for different types of documents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that K is chosen such that the whole text from the extracted multimodal summary can be fed to ChatGPT within a single API call. However, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how K affects the performance of PostDoc or discuss optimal strategies for determining K for different types of documents.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of varying K on the quality of the generated posters or provide guidelines for selecting K based on the characteristics of the input document, such as its length, complexity, or the proportion of multimodal content.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different values of K on various types of documents, analyzing the impact on the quality of the generated posters, and proposing and evaluating strategies for determining K based on document characteristics would provide insights into the optimal configuration of PostDoc for different use cases.

## Limitations
- Performance limitations for non-natural images (flow-charts, diagrams, tables) and structured elements
- Heuristic-based layout generation may lack flexibility for edge cases and complex content structures
- Effectiveness relies on maintaining submodularity with trainable weights, which may not generalize to documents with different multimodal distributions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The experimental results showing PostDoc's superiority over baselines in ROUGE metrics, multimodal summarization metrics, and human evaluation are well-supported by the reported data.
- **Medium confidence**: The claims about deep submodular function improvements and template generation superiority are supported by experiments, but rely on assumptions about embedding normalization and heuristic effectiveness that weren't fully validated with ablation studies.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that learned layout models like LayoutDM "struggle with poster-specific constraints" is based on a single comparison without exploring parameter tuning or architectural modifications that might improve performance.

## Next Checks

1. **Submodularity validation**: Design a synthetic experiment where the ground truth multimodal coverage is known, and verify that the deep submodular function with trainable weights consistently recovers this coverage better than non-trainable baselines.

2. **Layout flexibility test**: Generate posters with highly varied content structures (many images, few text; vice versa; mixed density) and evaluate whether the heuristic layout generation maintains aesthetic quality or produces pathological layouts in edge cases.

3. **Embedding normalization ablation**: Run the full pipeline with different embedding normalization strategies (L1, L2, no normalization) and measure the impact on multimodal alignment metrics to validate the necessity of the proposed normalization approach.
