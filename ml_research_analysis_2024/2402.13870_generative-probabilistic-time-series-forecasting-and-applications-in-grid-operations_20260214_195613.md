- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13870

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generative probabilistic forecasting for non-parametric stationary time series, proposing a method to generate future samples according to conditional probability distributions given past observations. The approach leverages a weak innovation autoencoder (WIAE) architecture to extract a Bayesian sufficient weak innovation sequence, which serves as the basis for future sample generation. The WIAE is trained using a novel algorithm incorporating Wasserstein GAN discriminators to enforce weak innovation conditions.

The method is applied to highly volatile real-time electricity prices, demonstrating superior performance compared to leading probabilistic and point forecasting techniques. Across multiple evaluation metrics including NMSE, NMAE, sMAPE, and CRPS, the proposed GPF-WI approach shows significant improvements. The results highlight the potential of innovation-based forecasting for decision-making under uncertainty in grid operations.

## Method Summary
The GPF-WI method introduces a weak innovation autoencoder (WIAE) architecture that extracts a Bayesian sufficient weak innovation sequence from time series data. This sequence captures the essential information needed to generate future samples while satisfying weak innovation conditions. The WIAE is trained using a novel algorithm that combines Wasserstein GAN discriminators to enforce these conditions during the learning process. By leveraging the properties of weak innovations, the method can generate probabilistic forecasts that accurately capture the uncertainty and volatility inherent in non-parametric stationary time series, particularly in the context of electricity price forecasting.

## Key Results
- GPF-WI outperforms leading probabilistic and point forecasting techniques for electricity price forecasting
- Superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics including NMSE, NMAE, sMAPE, and CRPS
- Demonstrates effectiveness in capturing highly volatile real-time electricity price patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by extracting a Bayesian sufficient weak innovation sequence from the time series data, which captures all the information needed for forecasting while satisfying weak innovation conditions. The WIAE architecture learns to transform the original time series into this innovation sequence, which has desirable statistical properties for forecasting. By enforcing these conditions through Wasserstein GAN discriminators during training, the model ensures that the generated samples are both realistic and probabilistically sound. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of modeling complex, non-parametric stationary processes while maintaining computational tractability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Weak Innovation Sequences**: Random sequences that preserve all predictive information while satisfying certain statistical properties. Why needed: These sequences form the theoretical foundation for the forecasting approach. Quick check: Verify that the extracted sequence satisfies the weak innovation conditions.
- **Wasserstein GAN Discriminators**: Neural networks that measure distributional distance using the Wasserstein metric. Why needed: They enforce the weak innovation conditions during training. Quick check: Monitor discriminator loss during training to ensure proper enforcement.
- **Autoencoder Architecture**: Neural network that learns to compress and reconstruct data. Why needed: Forms the basis of the WIAE for extracting innovation sequences. Quick check: Monitor reconstruction error to ensure information preservation.
- **Bayesian Sufficiency**: Property ensuring that a statistic contains all information needed for inference. Why needed: Guarantees that the innovation sequence contains all predictive information. Quick check: Verify that forecasting performance doesn't degrade with additional information.
- **Non-parametric Time Series**: Time series without assumed parametric models. Why needed: The approach is designed for general time series without model assumptions. Quick check: Test on various types of non-parametric processes.
- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Generating distributions over future values rather than point estimates. Why needed: Captures uncertainty crucial for decision-making in grid operations. Quick check: Compare coverage of prediction intervals against nominal levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Time Series -> WIAE Encoder -> Weak Innovation Sequence -> WIAE Decoder -> Generated Samples
Wasserstein GAN Discriminators (parallel to WIAE)

Critical Path:
The critical path flows through the WIAE architecture where the encoder transforms input time series into weak innovation sequences, which are then used to generate future samples through the decoder. The Wasserstein GAN discriminators work in parallel to enforce the weak innovation conditions during training.

Design Tradeoffs:
The architecture balances between information preservation (through the autoencoder structure) and statistical properties (through weak innovation enforcement). Using Wasserstein GAN discriminators provides stable training and meaningful gradients but increases computational complexity. The Bayesian sufficiency requirement ensures complete information retention but may limit the expressiveness of the innovation sequence.

Failure Signatures:
- If the discriminators dominate training, the model may generate samples that satisfy weak innovation conditions but poorly match the true distribution
- If the autoencoder fails to learn meaningful representations, the innovation sequence may not capture essential predictive information
- If the weak innovation conditions are not properly enforced, the generated samples may exhibit unrealistic statistical properties

First Experiments:
1. Train WIAE on synthetic stationary processes with known weak innovation structure to verify correct behavior
2. Evaluate reconstruction quality and innovation sequence statistics on held-out validation data
3. Generate samples from trained model and compare their statistical properties to the true data distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on non-stationary time series is not explored, as the framework assumes stationary processes
- Computational complexity of Wasserstein GAN discriminators during training is not discussed
- Comparison set is limited to specific probabilistic and point forecasting techniques, potentially overlooking other generative approaches

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mathematical foundation of the WIAE architecture and its theoretical properties
- Medium confidence in the empirical results, as they are demonstrated primarily on electricity price data from specific markets
- Medium confidence in the generalizability to other grid operation applications, as only one application area is thoroughly explored

## Next Checks
1. Test GPF-WI on non-stationary time series datasets to evaluate its robustness beyond the stationary assumption
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the Wasserstein GAN discriminators to overall performance
3. Compare GPF-WI against a broader range of generative time series models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, to establish its relative standing in the field
