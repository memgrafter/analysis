# PRAGyan -- Connecting the Dots in Tweets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.13909
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13909
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** PRAGyan framework improves causal reasoning in social media data by integrating Knowledge Graphs with LLMs using RAG approach

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of extracting causal insights from social media data, where traditional LLM analysis lacks depth in uncovering root causes. The proposed PRAGyan framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It leverages Neo4j to store structured semantic relationships and temporal information, enhancing causal reasoning through context retrieval. Quantitative evaluation shows PRAGyan outperforms baseline GPT-3.5 Turbo by 10% in BLEU and cosine similarity metrics. Qualitative analysis confirms richer, more contextually accurate responses.

## Method Summary
The PRAGyan framework integrates Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models to enhance causal reasoning in social media data analysis. The approach uses Neo4j to store structured semantic relationships and temporal information, enabling context retrieval through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The system retrieves relevant knowledge graph entities and relationships to augment LLM prompts, providing richer context for causal analysis. The framework processes tweets by first extracting entities and relationships, storing them in the KG, then using this structured knowledge to guide LLM-based causal reasoning.

## Key Results
- PRAGyan outperforms GPT-3.5 Turbo baseline by 10% in BLEU score for causal reasoning tasks
- Cosine similarity improvements demonstrate better alignment with ground truth causal relationships
- Qualitative analysis confirms more contextually accurate and richer responses compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by bridging the gap between unstructured social media text and structured causal knowledge. By storing semantic relationships and temporal information in Neo4j, PRAGyan provides LLMs with precise contextual information that would otherwise be lost in raw text processing. The RAG approach ensures that LLM responses are grounded in verified causal relationships rather than relying solely on pattern recognition. The integration of temporal reasoning allows the system to identify cause-effect sequences over time, which is crucial for understanding social media causality.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Knowledge Graph Construction** - Why needed: Provides structured representation of entities and relationships for causal reasoning
   - Quick check: Verify entity extraction accuracy and relationship mapping correctness

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** - Why needed: Combines structured knowledge retrieval with LLM generation capabilities
   - Quick check: Test retrieval precision and relevance of retrieved knowledge graph nodes

3. **Temporal Reasoning** - Why needed: Captures cause-effect sequences over time in social media data
   - Quick check: Validate temporal relationship extraction and ordering accuracy

4. **Neo4j Database Operations** - Why needed: Efficient storage and querying of semantic relationships
   - Quick check: Benchmark query performance and relationship traversal accuracy

5. **Causal Inference Principles** - Why needed: Ensures logical consistency in cause-effect relationship identification
   - Quick check: Test causal chain validation against known ground truth examples

6. **Social Media Data Preprocessing** - Why needed: Cleans and structures noisy social media text for KG integration
   - Quick check: Evaluate preprocessing pipeline's impact on entity recognition accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Tweet Processor -> Entity Extractor -> Neo4j KG -> RAG Retriever -> LLM Generator -> Causal Reasoner

**Critical Path:** The critical execution path flows from tweet preprocessing through entity extraction, knowledge graph storage, context retrieval, and finally LLM-based causal reasoning generation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational overhead from KG operations for improved causal reasoning accuracy. The use of Neo4j provides efficient relationship querying but adds complexity compared to pure LLM approaches. The RAG integration increases response latency but significantly improves contextual grounding.

**Failure Signatures:** System failures typically manifest as incomplete entity extraction, missing relationships in the knowledge graph, poor retrieval relevance, or LLM responses that ignore retrieved context. Common failure modes include temporal reasoning errors when causality spans multiple time periods and entity disambiguation failures in ambiguous social media contexts.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test entity extraction accuracy on sample tweets with known ground truth entities
2. Validate knowledge graph relationship creation with simple cause-effect pairs
3. Measure RAG retrieval relevance scores for causal context queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quantitative evaluation relies solely on BLEU and cosine similarity metrics without comprehensive causal reasoning assessment
- Qualitative assessment lacks systematic scoring criteria, potentially introducing subjectivity
- Temporal reasoning component effectiveness not thoroughly validated for capturing causality over time

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical implementation of PRAGyan framework and Neo4j integration is well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Quantitative performance improvements reported but lack statistical significance testing
- **Low Confidence**: Qualitative assessment methodology and temporal reasoning validation are insufficiently rigorous

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on BLEU and cosine similarity scores across multiple runs to verify the reported 10% improvement
2. Implement blind qualitative evaluation with multiple annotators using standardized scoring rubric to assess causal reasoning quality
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate contributions of temporal reasoning and KG retrieval to overall performance
