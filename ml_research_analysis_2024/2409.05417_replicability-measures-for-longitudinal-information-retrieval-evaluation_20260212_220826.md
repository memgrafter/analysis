# Replicability Measures for Longitudinal Information Retrieval Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.05417
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05417
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** Effectiveness generally improves over time, but system rankings vary depending on the evaluation measure used

## Executive Summary
This study investigates temporal persistence of retrieval effectiveness using replicability measures across evolving test collections. By treating different time points as distinct experimental environments, the authors evaluate five advanced retrieval systems using measures like Re∆, ∆RI, and ER to assess how effectiveness changes over time. The research demonstrates that while overall effectiveness improves across time points, system rankings are highly dependent on the specific evaluation measure employed, and no single system consistently shows the highest persistence. The study highlights that replicability measures provide deeper insights into system robustness compared to traditional effectiveness metrics, revealing that temporal changes affect different topics systematically rather than randomly.

## Method Summary
The study uses the LongEval shared task collection with three time points (WT, ST, LT) to evaluate five advanced retrieval systems (colBERT, monoT5, RRF, d2q, E5) and a BM25 baseline. Effectiveness is measured using P@10, nDCG, and bpref, while replicability is assessed through Re∆ (direct effectiveness change), ∆RI (relative improvement change), and ER (effect persistence) using the pivot system approach. The BM25 baseline serves as a pivot to normalize environmental changes across time points, allowing comparison of experimental systems' performance relative to this neutral reference point. Per-topic analysis reveals systematic variations in effectiveness changes across different queries.

## Key Results
- Effectiveness generally improves over time across all systems and measures
- System rankings vary significantly depending on which evaluation measure is used
- No single system consistently demonstrates the highest temporal persistence across all measures
- Topic-level analysis reveals systematic rather than random variations in effectiveness changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pivot-based delta comparison enables temporal replicability by normalizing environmental changes.
- Mechanism: By comparing the experimental system's delta from a pivot system in one EE to the same delta in another EE, the measure isolates system performance changes from environmental shifts.
- Core assumption: The pivot system experiences identical environmental changes as the experimental system, making it a valid baseline for delta comparison.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Based on the LongEval shared task and test collection, this work explores how the effectiveness measured in evolving experiments can be assessed."
  - [section] "The intuition behind this evaluation strategy is that since the pivot system is exposed to the same EE as the experimental system, hence encountering the same difficulties, it represents a neutral reference point that makes the results more comparable."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related longitudinal studies but no direct evidence about pivot system effectiveness.
- Break condition: If the pivot system's performance changes differently from the experimental system due to different sensitivities to environmental changes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple replicability measures provide complementary insights into temporal robustness.
- Mechanism: Re∆ measures absolute effectiveness change, ∆RI captures relative improvement changes, and ER quantifies effect persistence across environments.
- Core assumption: Different aspects of temporal persistence require different measurement approaches to capture the full picture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Employing adapted replicability measures provides further insight into the persistence of effectiveness."
  - [section] "The ∆RI describes how the effectiveness relatively changed from one EE to an evolved EE'. While the ∆RI describes the change in effectiveness, the ER describes the persistence of the effectiveness."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus mentions longitudinal evaluation but lacks specific evidence about multi-measure approaches.
- Break condition: When different measures produce conflicting results without clear interpretation framework.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topic-level analysis reveals heterogeneity in temporal effectiveness that aggregate measures obscure.
- Mechanism: Per-topic effectiveness deltas show that some queries improve while others degrade, revealing systematic patterns masked by overall averages.
- Core assumption: Temporal changes affect different topics differently, and this variation is meaningful for understanding system behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For example, the RRF system achieved a high nDCG (0.285) at WT and is relatively stable at ST considering the Re∆ of 0.009. However, the per-topic results fluctuate between -0.4 and 0.8."
  - [abstract] "The ranking of systems varies across retrieval measures and time."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related studies but lacks specific evidence about topic-level temporal analysis.
- Break condition: When topic-level variations are random rather than systematic, making individual topic analysis uninformative.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cranfield paradigm
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates IR systems using fixed experimental setups, which is central to the Cranfield paradigm's approach to systematic evaluation.
  - Quick check question: What is the main limitation of Cranfield-style evaluation when applied to dynamic environments?

- Concept: Test collection evolution
  - Why needed here: Understanding how test collections change over time is crucial for interpreting temporal effectiveness measurements and replicability.
  - Quick check question: How does document addition, removal, and update frequency affect the validity of temporal comparisons?

- Concept: Replicability vs reproducibility
  - Why needed here: The paper frames temporal persistence as a replicability task, requiring understanding of the distinction between these related but distinct concepts.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a reproducibility task and a replicability task in IR evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data -> Effectiveness calculation -> Replicability measures -> Statistical analysis -> Topic-level analysis
- Critical path:
  1. Load system runs for all time points
  2. Calculate effectiveness measures (P@10, nDCG, bpref)
  3. Compute Re∆ between time points
  4. Calculate ∆RI and ER using pivot system
  5. Perform statistical significance testing
  6. Generate per-topic analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. evolving test collections: Fixed collections enable reproducibility but miss temporal dynamics
  - Single vs. multiple measures: Single measures are simpler but may miss important aspects of temporal persistence
  - Topic aggregation vs. individual analysis: Aggregation provides clarity but may hide important variations
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent results across different measures suggest environmental factors not captured by any single measure
  - High variance in per-topic results indicates systematic changes affecting different queries differently
  - Lack of significant differences between systems suggests insufficient test collection dynamics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run basic Re∆ analysis on all systems across all time points to establish baseline temporal trends
  2. Calculate ∆RI and ER for systems showing interesting Re∆ patterns to understand relative changes
  3. Perform per-topic analysis on systems with highest and lowest persistence to identify systematic patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of pivot system affect the replicability measures and their interpretation of temporal persistence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that only BM25 was considered as the pivot system and suggests that future work should investigate the selection of the pivot system.
- Why unresolved: Different pivot systems may lead to varying replicability measure results, potentially affecting the conclusions drawn about system robustness over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing multiple pivot systems (e.g., BM25, QL, RM3) across the same evaluation tasks would show how pivot choice impacts replicability measures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do replicability measures generalize across different test collections and retrieval scenarios beyond LongEval?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that the study is limited to LongEval and calls for future work to extend evaluations to other scenarios with different changes and dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness and interpretation of replicability measures may vary depending on the characteristics of the test collection, such as document dynamics, query sets, and relevance distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying replicability measures to diverse test collections (e.g., TREC, GOV2) and retrieval scenarios (e.g., news, social media) would reveal their generalizability and robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the sub-collection differences and the observed disagreement between Re∆ and replicability measures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the disagreement between Re∆ and replicability measures might indicate differences between sub-collections and highlights the need to investigate what differentiates longitudinal evaluation from cross-test collection evaluation.
- Why unresolved: Understanding the nature of sub-collection differences is crucial for interpreting replicability measures and their ability to capture temporal persistence accurately.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of sub-collection characteristics (e.g., document churn, query distribution, relevance changes) and their correlation with replicability measure results would shed light on the relationship between sub-collection differences and measure disagreement.

## Limitations

- Analysis constrained by three time-point structure of LongEval collection, potentially missing long-term persistence patterns
- Assumes BM25 pivot system experiences environmental changes similarly to experimental systems without empirical validation
- Focus on French/English web search data limits generalizability to other domains or languages

## Confidence

- High confidence in core findings about temporal effectiveness improvement and system ranking variability
- Medium confidence in interpretation of replicability measures due to pivot system assumptions and limited temporal scope
- Medium confidence in generalizability to other domains based on single test collection used

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the analysis using alternative pivot systems to verify robustness of replicability measure interpretations
2. Extend the temporal analysis to include additional time points if available, to better understand long-term persistence patterns
3. Apply the same methodology to a different domain (e.g., scientific literature search) to assess generalizability of findings
