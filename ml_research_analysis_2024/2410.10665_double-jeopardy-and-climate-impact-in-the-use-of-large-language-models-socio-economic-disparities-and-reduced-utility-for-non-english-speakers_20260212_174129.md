# Double Jeopardy and Climate Impact in the Use of Large Language Models: Socio-economic Disparities and Reduced Utility for Non-English Speakers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10665
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10665
- Reference count: 40
- Non-English speakers face 4-6x higher API costs and lower LLM performance, especially in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

## Executive Summary
Large Language Models (LLMs) impose significantly higher costs and deliver poorer performance for non-English speakers, especially those from low- and lower-middle-income countries. This "double jeopardy" stems from tokenization inefficiencies: non-English languages are fragmented into more tokens, raising usage costs, while LLM performance in these languages remains low. Using FLORES-200/+, Ethnologue, and World Bank data, the study finds that around 1.5 billion speakers in lower-middle-income countries face 4-6x higher costs than English speakers. Even with improvements in GPT-4o, premium costs and performance gaps persist, disproportionately affecting low-resource languages. Fragmentation also increases computational demands and carbon emissions. Addressing these disparities requires algorithmic optimization, better data for low-resource languages, and localized pricing strategies.

## Method Summary
The study analyzes socioeconomic disparities in LLM usage by calculating tokenization premiums for 194 languages using GPT-4 and GPT-4o tokenizers, mapping these to income levels via population-weighted GDP, and evaluating translation task performance as a proxy for LLM utility. Data sources include FLORES-200/+, Ethnologue, and World Bank WDI. Fragmentation premiums are computed relative to English, and translation quality is assessed using GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o APIs with back-translation tasks. The analysis compares GPT-4 and GPT-4o to quantify improvements and their impact on disparities.

## Key Results
- Non-English languages require 4-6x more tokens than English, leading to proportionally higher API costs.
- Around 1.5 billion speakers in lower-middle-income countries face the highest fragmentation premiums.
- Translation quality for low-resource languages remains poor, compounding the "double jeopardy" of higher costs and lower utility.
- GPT-4o shows modest improvements but does not eliminate cost or performance gaps for non-English speakers.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fragmentation of non-English languages into more tokens directly raises usage costs and increases computational demand.
- Mechanism: Tokenizers break non-English text into more subword tokens than English, increasing the token count per unit of text. Since API pricing is per token, this fragmentation raises costs proportionally. Additionally, higher token counts increase floating-point operations (FLOPs), amplifying carbon emissions.
- Core assumption: The tokenizer's training data reflects a strong English bias, leading to less efficient segmentation for morphologically rich or low-resource languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Speakers of languages in low-income and lower-middle-income countries face higher costs when using OpenAI’s GPT models via APIs because of how the system processes the input—tokenization."
  - [section 4.2.1]: "Since a single token is typically the unit of pricing for most paid LLM API services, languages that experience greater fragmentation will incur higher costs."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers, but none directly provide evidence for the tokenizer bias assumption. This is inferred from cited literature on fragmentation.
- Break condition: If a tokenizer is retrained on balanced multilingual corpora or if a pricing model shifts away from token-based billing.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Poor translation quality in low-resource languages compounds the cost disadvantage, creating a "double jeopardy."
- Mechanism: Low-resource languages not only pay more due to fragmentation but also receive lower-quality translations. The model's poor performance means users may need to make multiple API calls or seek alternatives, amplifying the economic burden.
- Core assumption: The translation quality metric is a reliable proxy for overall LLM performance in those languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show that LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages, presenting a 'double jeopardy' of higher costs and poor performance for these users."
  - [section 4.4]: "We use language translation to evaluate LLMs’ performance across different languages, focusing on low-resource languages."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for the translation quality proxy assumption; relies on experimental results in the paper.
- Break condition: If translation performance improves through better training data or model fine-tuning for low-resource languages.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Currency delocalization increases costs for non-English speakers in low- and lower-middle-income countries, exacerbating access disparities.
- Mechanism: API providers price services in major currencies (e.g., USD), so users in countries with weaker or volatile local currencies face higher effective costs when converting to pay for API usage.
- Core assumption: The price of LLM API services remains fixed in USD, while local currency values fluctuate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.3]: "Providers such as OpenAI, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) typically charge in major currencies, primarily the US dollar (USD)."
  - [section 6.3]: "When local currencies depreciate against the USD, the costs of accessing LLM services through cloud platforms can rise dramatically."
  - [corpus]: No corpus evidence directly supporting this claim; it is derived from general knowledge of cloud service pricing.
- Break condition: If providers adopt local currency pricing or if governments subsidize access to reduce the impact of forex volatility.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tokenization and subword segmentation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how text is broken into tokens is essential to grasp why non-English languages incur higher costs.
  - Quick check question: Why do languages like Telugu require more tokens than English for the same sentence?

- Concept: Floating-point operations (FLOPs) as a proxy for computational cost and carbon emissions
  - Why needed here: FLOP counts link tokenization inefficiencies to environmental impact, a key claim in the paper.
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the number of tokens processed affect the estimated FLOP count?

- Concept: Population-weighted GDP and language-income classification
  - Why needed here: These metrics connect language use to economic status, enabling the analysis of cost disparities across income groups.
  - Quick check question: How is the population-weighted GDP for a language calculated, and why is it used instead of simple GDP averages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data sources: FLORES-200/+, Ethnologue, World Bank WDI
  - Tokenizer models: GPT-4, GPT-4o
  - LLM evaluation: GPT-4o as judge for translation quality
  - Analysis pipeline: Compute fragmentation premiums → map to income levels → assess performance disparities

- Critical path:
  1. Tokenize sentences in multiple languages using GPT-4 and GPT-4o tokenizers.
  2. Calculate fragmentation premiums relative to English.
  3. Aggregate speaker populations and income levels by language.
  4. Evaluate translation quality via back-translation with GPT-4o judge.
  5. Analyze relationships between premium, income, population, and performance.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using translation quality as a proxy for LLM performance is efficient but may not capture all task types.
  - Population-weighted GDP smooths individual country disparities but may obscure within-country variation.
  - Binary vs. five-point rating scales for translation quality trade off simplicity for nuance.

- Failure signatures:
  - If fragmentation premiums do not correlate with income levels, the economic disparity hypothesis fails.
  - If translation quality does not differ significantly by language group, the "double jeopardy" claim weakens.
  - If GPT-4o improvements do not reduce premiums, claims about model progress are unsupported.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate tokenization premium calculations for a new set of low-resource languages to test generalizability.
  2. Compare translation quality using alternative LLM judges (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to validate robustness.
  3. Simulate cost impacts under different pricing models (e.g., flat-rate, local currency) to quantify delocalization effects.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific technical or algorithmic innovations could reduce tokenization fragmentation for low-resource languages without compromising model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for "better algorithm development" and "optimizing tokenization strategies" to address fragmentation, but does not detail specific solutions.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but does not propose concrete technical solutions or innovations to reduce fragmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed technical proposals or experimental results showing reduced fragmentation for low-resource languages through new tokenization algorithms or model architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can localized pricing strategies be effectively implemented to mitigate the economic disparities caused by tokenization premiums in different regions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests "localized pricing strategies" as a potential solution but does not elaborate on how these could be implemented.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies localized pricing as a solution, it does not provide a framework or evidence for how this could be achieved in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or pilot programs demonstrating successful implementation of localized pricing strategies that reduce economic disparities for non-English speakers.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the long-term impact of LLM-generated content on the quality and reliability of data for low-resource languages, and how can this be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper raises concerns about the "contamination of the internet with subpar or incorrect content" in low-resource languages due to LLM-generated content.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the risk but does not explore the long-term implications or potential mitigation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking the quality of LLM-generated content over time and the effectiveness of interventions to improve data quality for low-resource languages.

## Limitations

- The use of translation quality as a proxy for overall LLM performance may not fully capture disparities across different task types.
- The analysis relies on static pricing models and does not account for potential future changes in API pricing structures.
- Environmental impact estimates based on FLOP counts are theoretical and do not reflect real-world energy consumption or carbon emissions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that non-English languages are tokenized into more tokens, leading to higher API costs, is strongly supported by the evidence.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that low-resource languages face both higher costs and lower performance ("double jeopardy") is supported by the data, but relies on translation quality as a proxy for overall performance.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that currency delocalization significantly exacerbates access disparities is plausible but not directly tested in the study.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the tokenization premium calculations for a new set of low-resource languages not included in the original study to test the robustness and generalizability of the cost disparities observed.

2. Compare translation quality results using alternative LLM judges (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to ensure that the "double jeopardy" findings are not artifacts of the specific judge used in the study.

3. Model the cost impacts under different pricing strategies (e.g., flat-rate, local currency pricing) to quantify how much currency delocalization contributes to the observed disparities and test the sensitivity of the results to pricing assumptions.
