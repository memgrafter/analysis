core_contribution: This work introduces the first highly multilingual speech and American
  Sign Language (ASL) comprehension dataset, 2M-BELEBELE, covering 74 spoken languages
  and one sign language. It extends the existing BELEBELE benchmark by aligning passages
  with the FLEURS speech dataset and commissioning human recordings for the remaining
  passages, questions, and answers.

# 2M-BELEBELE: Highly Multilingual Speech and American Sign Language Comprehension Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.08274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08274
- Reference count: 6
- First highly multilingual speech and American Sign Language comprehension dataset covering 74 spoken languages and one sign language

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces 2M-BELEBELE, a groundbreaking dataset for multilingual speech and American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension. The dataset extends the existing BELEBELE benchmark by aligning passages with the FLEURS speech dataset and commissioning human recordings for the remaining passages, questions, and answers. It includes 488 distinct passages, 900 questions, and 4 multiple-choice answers per question across 74 spoken languages and one sign language.

The evaluation experiments demonstrate that speech comprehension accuracy is approximately 2-3% lower on average compared to text comprehension across languages. This dataset enables multimodal comprehension evaluation and supports further research in multilingual speech and sign language understanding, representing a significant advancement in the field.

## Method Summary
The 2M-BELEBELE dataset was constructed by extending the BELEBELE benchmark with speech and sign language components. The researchers aligned passages with the FLEURS speech dataset for 57 languages and commissioned human recordings for the remaining 17 languages, along with corresponding questions and answers. The dataset includes 488 distinct passages, each paired with 900 questions and 4 multiple-choice answers per question. The construction process involved careful alignment of text, speech, and sign language modalities to ensure consistency across the multilingual and multimodal content.

## Key Results
- First highly multilingual speech and American Sign Language comprehension dataset covering 74 spoken languages and one sign language
- Speech comprehension accuracy is approximately 2-3% lower on average compared to text comprehension across languages
- Dataset includes 488 distinct passages, 900 questions, and 4 multiple-choice answers per question

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive multilingual coverage and multimodal alignment. By leveraging the FLEURS speech dataset and augmenting it with human recordings, the researchers created a robust foundation for evaluating comprehension across modalities. The multiple-choice question format provides a standardized evaluation framework that enables consistent comparison across languages and modalities.

## Foundational Learning
- Multilingual speech processing: Understanding how speech models handle diverse languages and accents
  - Why needed: Essential for building models that work across global populations
  - Quick check: Evaluate model performance across different language families

- Sign language recognition: Capturing visual-manual modality comprehension
  - Why needed: Enables accessibility for deaf communities and multimodal understanding
- Quick check: Compare sign language comprehension accuracy with spoken language baselines

- Speech-text alignment: Ensuring consistency between spoken and written content
  - Why needed: Critical for multimodal comprehension evaluation
  - Quick check: Measure alignment accuracy between speech and text passages

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Passage Collection -> Speech Recording -> Question Generation -> Multiple Choice Answers -> Comprehension Evaluation

Critical Path: Text passages are recorded as speech, questions are generated, and both are evaluated for comprehension accuracy across modalities.

Design Tradeoffs: The choice of multiple-choice questions enables standardized evaluation but may not capture nuanced comprehension. The reliance on existing speech datasets reduces recording costs but may introduce consistency variations.

Failure Signatures: Performance gaps between speech and text comprehension indicate potential issues with speech recognition quality or alignment accuracy. Lower performance on certain languages may suggest recording quality or language-specific challenges.

First Experiments:
1. Baseline text comprehension evaluation across all 74 languages
2. Speech comprehension evaluation with identical questions to text baseline
3. Sign language comprehension evaluation with dedicated sign language questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 2-3% average performance gap between speech and text comprehension across 74 languages, while notable, may mask significant variation between individual languages
- The dataset's reliance on multiple recording sources (FLEURS for 57 languages, human recordings for 17) may introduce variability in recording quality
- The multiple-choice evaluation format may not fully capture nuanced comprehension abilities, particularly for sign language understanding where contextual and cultural factors play important roles

## Confidence
- Dataset construction and scope: High
- Reported performance comparisons: Medium
- Generalizability of results to real-world sign language comprehension scenarios: Medium-Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical analysis of performance gaps across individual languages to identify outliers and patterns
2. Implement human evaluation studies to validate the multiple-choice assessment methodology
3. Extend the evaluation framework to include more diverse comprehension tasks and question types
