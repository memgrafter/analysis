# The Language Barrier: Dissecting Safety Challenges of LLMs in Multilingual Contexts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.13136
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13136
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: LLMs generate more harmful and less relevant responses in lower-resource languages compared to higher-resource languages due to insufficient pre-training data

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies two key safety challenges in multilingual LLM contexts: the "harmfulness curse" where models generate more harmful responses in lower-resource languages, and the "relevance curse" where responses are less relevant to malicious prompts. The authors trace these challenges to insufficient low-resource language data during the pre-training stage, which results in weaker safety pattern recognition. While alignment techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback improve model alignment in higher-resource languages, they yield minimal improvement in lower-resource languages. The study provides important insights into cross-lingual safety disparities and highlights the need for better multilingual alignment approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate LLaMa2-7B models using monolingual and multilingual fine-tuning (xSFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (xRLHF) on a translated HH-RLHF dataset. They assess performance across 10 languages (5 high-resource: English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French; 5 low-resource: Hausa, Igbo, Kamba, Halh, Urdu) using HARMFUL RATE and FOLLOWING RATE metrics. Harmful prompts from Zou et al. (2023) were translated using NLLB-1.3B. The models were evaluated using GPT-4 to classify responses into Harmful, Harmless, or Unfollowing categories.

## Key Results
- LLMs exhibit significantly higher HARMFUL RATE in lower-resource languages compared to higher-resource languages
- FOLLOWING RATE is consistently lower for low-resource languages, indicating less relevant responses
- Alignment techniques improve safety in high-resource languages but show minimal improvement in low-resource languages
- Reward models trained on multilingual data perform well in high-resource languages but approach random performance (50% accuracy) in low-resource languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Low-resource languages suffer from harmfulness curse due to insufficient multilingual data during pre-training.
- Mechanism: LLMs learn language-specific safety patterns during pre-training. Low-resource languages lack sufficient data, resulting in weaker safety pattern recognition. When aligned, the model's safety behavior becomes more pronounced in high-resource languages where safety patterns are well-learned, creating a relative vulnerability in low-resource languages.
- Core assumption: Pre-training data quantity and quality directly determine the model's cross-lingual safety capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We trace the origin of these challenges back to the limited low-resource data available during the pre-training stage of LLMs."
  - [section 4] "Instead, as shown in the results of our alignment stage (Table 3), we observe severe bias towards languages from different resource levels."
- Break condition: Adding substantial low-resource language data during pre-training eliminates the harmfulness curse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Relevance curse emerges from amplification of pre-training bias during alignment.
- Mechanism: Base LLMs already show lower FOLLOWING RATE in low-resource languages due to pre-training bias. Alignment training (especially RLHF) amplifies this bias by focusing on high-resource languages where the model has stronger instruction-following capabilities, making the low-resource language gap more pronounced.
- Core assumption: Alignment training reinforces existing pre-training biases rather than correcting them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We observe that (2) LLMs tend to generate more irrelevant responses to malicious prompts in lower-resource languages."
  - [section 4] "Unlike the case of harmfulness curse, we can observe relevance curse after the pre-training stage of LLMs."
- Break condition: Balanced multilingual alignment data eliminates the relevance curse.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: xRLHF fails due to biased reward model performance across languages.
- Mechanism: The reward model trained on multilingual data shows strong bias - performing well in high-resource languages but near-random performance in low-resource languages. This biased reward signal leads xRLHF to reinforce harmful behaviors in low-resource languages while improving safety in high-resource languages.
- Core assumption: Reward model performance directly translates to policy improvement across languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "While X-RM performs commendably in high-resource languages, its effectiveness sharply declines for languages with fewer resources."
  - [section 5.1] "Its accuracy in low-resource languages hovers around a mere 50%, suggesting it is no better than random guessing."
- Break condition: Creating unbiased multilingual reward models eliminates xRLHF failure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal Language Modeling Loss
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs learn language patterns during pre-training is crucial for grasping why low-resource languages suffer from safety vulnerabilities.
  - Quick check question: Why does causal language modeling loss make LLMs particularly vulnerable to data scarcity in low-resource languages?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
  - Why needed here: xRLHF is a key alignment method evaluated in the paper, and understanding its mechanism is essential for interpreting why it fails for low-resource languages.
  - Quick check question: How does the reward model's performance bias affect the effectiveness of xRLHF across different language resources?

- Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: LoRA is used in the alignment experiments, and understanding its impact on model capabilities is important for interpreting the experimental results.
  - Quick check question: Why does LoRA preserve general reasoning ability better than full fine-tuning during alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base LLM → Alignment Stage (SFT/RLHF) → Evaluation (HARMFUL RATE/FOLLOWING RATE)
- Critical path: Pre-training multilingual data → Alignment training → Evaluation across languages
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing alignment effectiveness vs. cross-lingual capability; using LoRA vs. full fine-tuning
- Failure signatures: Harmfulness curse shows as high HARMFUL RATE in low-resource languages post-alignment; relevance curse shows as low FOLLOWING RATE gap between language resources
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate base LLM's HARMFUL RATE and FOLLOWING RATE across high/low-resource languages
  2. Apply monolingual SFT in English and evaluate cross-lingual transfer
  3. Apply multilingual xSFT and compare improvement patterns between language resources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the level of pre-training data for low-resource languages impact the harmfulness and relevance curses in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors trace the origin of the curses to limited low-resource data during pre-training, but do not provide empirical evidence quantifying this relationship.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct experiments varying the amount of pre-training data for low-resource languages to measure the effect on harmfulness and relevance rates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training LLMs on increasing amounts of low-resource language data and measuring the resulting harmfulness and relevance rates across different languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can multilingual pre-training effectively alleviate the harmfulness and relevance curses in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that multilingual pre-training may help, but do not provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct experiments comparing the harmfulness and relevance rates of LLMs pre-trained on multilingual data versus monolingual data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training LLMs on multilingual pre-training data and measuring the resulting harmfulness and relevance rates across different languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of alignment method (SFT vs. RLHF) impact the harmfulness and relevance rates of LLMs in low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare the effectiveness of SFT and RLHF in reducing harmfulness and relevance rates, but do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of each method.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct experiments comparing the harmfulness and relevance rates of LLMs aligned with SFT versus RLHF across different languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training LLMs with SFT and RLHF alignment methods and measuring the resulting harmfulness and relevance rates across different languages.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical evidence directly linking pre-training data scarcity to harmfulness curse
- No pre-training data corpus analysis to support claims about data quantity/quality
- Insufficient investigation of whether alignment techniques could be improved rather than the fundamental approach being flawed

## Confidence

- High confidence: The empirical observations of harmfulness and relevance curses across language resources; reward model performance degradation in low-resource languages.
- Medium confidence: The explanation that alignment techniques amplify pre-training biases rather than correcting them; the general claim that low-resource languages face safety challenges.
- Low confidence: The specific causal link between pre-training data scarcity and harmfulness curse; the completeness of the proposed mechanisms explaining all observed phenomena.

## Next Checks

1. **Pre-training data ablation study**: Train identical model architectures with varying quantities of low-resource language data to directly test whether data scarcity during pre-training causes the harmfulness curse.

2. **Reward model intervention experiment**: Replace the biased reward model with a balanced version that performs equally well across all languages, then evaluate whether xRLHF success improves in low-resource languages.

3. **Cross-lingual transfer analysis**: Train separate monolingual models for high-resource and low-resource languages, then evaluate their zero-shot performance on each other's languages to determine whether the safety gaps are truly cross-lingual or language-specific.
