# Solving a Stackelberg Game on Transportation Networks in a Dynamic Crime Scenario: A Mixed Approach on Multi-Layer Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14514
- Reference count: 21
- The paper proposes a mixed approach using multi-layer time-expanded networks to solve Stackelberg games for dynamic crime interdiction on transportation grids, achieving comparable solution quality to exact MILP methods with significantly reduced computational time.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interdicting dynamic criminals on large transportation networks with limited police resources by modeling the problem as a Stackelberg game. The proposed solution uses a novel mixed approach with multi-layer time-expanded networks, where each time stamp creates a copy of the entire network. The attacker's optimal escape route is found using Dijkstra's algorithm on the layered network, while a novel approximation algorithm generates near-optimal defender strategies. Tested on grid networks from 3x3 to 9x9, the method demonstrates solution quality comparable to exact MILP methods but with dramatically reduced computational time—under 50 seconds for 9x9 grids versus over 500 seconds for MILP.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a mixed approach (MLN-EIGS) for Stackelberg games on transportation networks by creating time-expanded multi-layer networks. For each discrete time step, a complete copy of the original network is generated, with edges between copies representing possible movements weighted by travel time. The attacker's optimal strategy is computed using Dijkstra's algorithm on this layered network to minimize interdiction probability. For the defender, a novel approximation algorithm is proposed that uses color-coded vertex covering to ensure interception of attacker paths. The approach is compared against an exact MILP formulation (MILP-EIGS) on grid networks ranging from 3x3 to 9x9, demonstrating significant computational advantages while maintaining solution quality.

## Key Results
- The MLN-EIGS approach solves the 9x9 grid problem in under 50 seconds compared to over 500 seconds for the exact MILP-EIGS method
- Solution quality remains comparable to the exact MILP approach across all tested grid sizes
- The method successfully handles the computational complexity of dynamic crime interdiction within short time frames

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-layer time-expanded networks enable modeling attacker movement across time stamps without exponential state space growth.
- Mechanism: At each discrete time step, a complete copy of the transportation network is created, and edges between copies encode possible movements weighted by travel time.
- Core assumption: Edge length in the original network directly maps to time delay between time-expanded layers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "At each time stamp, we create a copy of the entire transportation network to track the possible movements of both players"
  - [section] "At each time-stamp, we create a copy of the entire network. Then, we establish connections in this multi-layer network using the edge lengths in the original graph"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on game-theoretic cybersecurity, not transportation time expansion.
- Break condition: If travel times are non-linear or stochastic, fixed edge-based time mapping fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dijkstra's algorithm on time-expanded networks efficiently finds attacker's optimal escape route minimizing interdiction probability.
- Mechanism: Nodes in the multi-layer network are weighted by defender coverage probability; Dijkstra finds the path with minimal total weight.
- Core assumption: Attacker strategy is pure (single deterministic path), making shortest-path optimization valid.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Given a set of defender strategies, the optimal attacker strategy is determined by applying Dijkstra's algorithm on the layered networks"
  - [section] "Finally, we apply Dijkstra's algorithm on this network to find the optimal strategy for the attacker"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors do not discuss Dijkstra-based pathfinding for security games.
- Break condition: If attacker uses mixed strategies or path probabilities matter, pure shortest-path fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Color-coded vertex covering approximates defender strategy by ensuring at least one interception point per attacker path.
- Mechanism: Each attacker path is assigned a unique color; defender seeks a path containing at least one vertex of each color within time budget.
- Core assumption: Attacker pure strategy set is known and finite, enabling color assignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For the defender, we create a multi-layer network in the same way as for the attacker. Weights are assigned to all nodes based on the attacker strategies, with each attacker strategy given equal probability"
  - [section] "We use different colors to represent each attacker strategy. The developed defender strategy includes as many different colored vertices as possible"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors do not describe color-based vertex covering in security games.
- Break condition: If attacker can change strategy dynamically, static color assignment becomes obsolete.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stackelberg game equilibrium (leader-follower sequential moves)
  - Why needed here: The defender commits first, then attacker responds optimally; models realistic asymmetric information.
  - Quick check question: In a Stackelberg game, who commits to a strategy first and why?

- Concept: Time-expanded network modeling
  - Why needed here: Captures temporal dynamics of attacker movement across discrete time steps.
  - Quick check question: How does creating network copies per time step avoid state explosion?

- Concept: Mixed vs. pure strategies
  - Why needed here: Defender uses mixed strategies (probabilistic patrol allocation), attacker uses pure (deterministic path).
  - Quick check question: Why might a defender benefit from mixed strategies while attacker uses pure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> Multi-layer network generator -> Attacker module -> Defender module -> Solver loop
- Critical path: Network generation → Attacker optimization → Defender approximation → Utility calculation → Convergence check
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact MILP vs. approximation: MILP guarantees optimal defender strategy but scales poorly; approximation is faster but near-optimal
  - Time discretization granularity: Finer time steps improve accuracy but increase network size exponentially
  - Pure vs. mixed attacker strategies: Pure simplifies attacker optimization but may be less realistic
- Failure signatures:
  - Excessive runtimes: MILP component or overly fine time discretization
  - Poor solution quality: Approximation algorithm missing critical colors or time budget too restrictive
  - Non-convergence: Game utility oscillating above threshold, indicating poor strategy space coverage
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify multi-layer network construction by visualizing 2-3 time steps on a 3x3 grid
  2. Test attacker module alone with fixed defender strategy to confirm Dijkstra finds minimal interdiction path
  3. Run full algorithm on 3x3 grid and compare with MILP baseline for runtime and utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the developed MLN-EIGS approach perform on real-world transportation networks with traffic congestion data incorporated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a limitation that the approach does not include real-time traffic and suggests future research on incorporating traffic.
- Why unresolved: The current approach uses static networks without traffic data, so its performance under dynamic traffic conditions remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the algorithm on real-world traffic data and comparing performance metrics like solution quality and computational time against the static network version.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can an exact algorithm be developed for the defender that matches the optimal performance of the attacker's exact approach on time-expanded networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states this as a potential future direction, noting that only an approximation algorithm exists for the defender.
- Why unresolved: The approximation algorithm provides near-optimal solutions but not guaranteed optimal ones, unlike the attacker's exact approach using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing an exact defender algorithm on various network sizes and comparing its solution quality and computational time to the current approximation method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical performance gap between the approximation algorithm for defenders and the optimal solution, and how does it scale with network size?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proves the defender's problem is NP-complete and provides an approximation algorithm, but doesn't analyze the approximation ratio or scalability.
- Why unresolved: While the algorithm is shown to be time-efficient, its solution quality relative to optimal solutions is not quantified, especially for larger networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical analysis of the approximation ratio and computational experiments comparing the algorithm's solutions to optimal solutions on various network sizes.

## Limitations

- The approximation algorithm for defender strategy lacks complete implementation details, making faithful reproduction challenging
- The method has only been tested on grid networks (3x3 to 9x9), limiting generalizability to real-world transportation networks
- The approach does not incorporate real-time traffic data or dynamic congestion information

## Confidence

- High confidence in the fundamental approach of using multi-layer time-expanded networks for dynamic security games
- Medium confidence in the scalability claims due to limited testing only on grid networks (3x3 to 9x9)
- Low confidence in the approximation algorithm's solution quality without knowing exact implementation details

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the defender approximation algorithm on small instances (2x2 grid) to verify it produces feasible paths with required color coverage
2. Compare the multi-layer network construction against exact MILP formulations on 3x3 grids across multiple random seedings to validate runtime claims
3. Test the algorithm's sensitivity to time discretization granularity by comparing solutions using tmax values differing by factor of 2 on the same grid instances
