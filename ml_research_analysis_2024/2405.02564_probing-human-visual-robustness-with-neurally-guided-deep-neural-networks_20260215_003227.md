# Probing Human Visual Robustness with Neurally-Guided Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02564
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02564
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Neurally-guided deep networks achieve hierarchical improvements in adversarial robustness by aligning with human ventral visual stream representations

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks by leveraging neural representations from the human ventral visual stream (VVS). The authors propose that human visual robustness stems from increasingly resilient representations along the VVS hierarchy, and test whether guiding DNNs with these neural representations can enhance their robustness. Using neural predictors trained on fMRI data from human participants viewing natural images, they guide DNNs to align their representations with neural responses from consecutive VVS regions (V1, V2, V4, VO, PHC, LO, TO). The neurally-guided models show hierarchical improvements in adversarial robustness, with models guided by later VVS regions exhibiting greater resilience.

## Method Summary
The method involves training neural predictors on fMRI data from 7T scans to predict neural responses from VVS regions (V1, V2, V4, VO, PHC, LO, TO). These predictors are then used to guide ResNet18 models during training by adding a neural alignment loss alongside the classification loss. Seven neural-guided models are trained, each aligned with one VVS region, and compared against baseline models with no neural guidance. The resulting models are evaluated for adversarial robustness, smoothness, shape bias, and representational similarity using multiple attack types and analysis methods.

## Key Results
- Models guided by later VVS regions (VO, PHC, LO, TO) exhibit greater adversarial robustness than those guided by earlier regions (V1, V2, V4)
- Neurally-guided models develop more human-like properties, including increased shape bias in decision-making
- Neural guidance creates smoother output surfaces compared to conventionally trained models
- Neurally-guided models are less susceptible to transfer attacks, indicating fundamentally different representational spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neural guidance improves robustness by aligning DNN representations with increasingly disentangled neural manifolds along the ventral visual stream.
- Mechanism: The ventral visual stream creates a hierarchical progression of neural representations that become more invariant to identity-preserving transformations. By training DNNs to match neural responses from higher-order regions, they inherit smoother decision surfaces and better-separated category manifolds.
- Core assumption: The representational geometry in higher VVS regions (VO, PHC, LO, TO) is inherently more robust and generalizes better to image perturbations than lower-level representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models guided by later VVS regions exhibiting greater resilience" and "smaller extent and better linear separability... emerge across the human VVS"
  - [section] "as visual inputs traverse these hierarchically organized regions, their representation becomes increasingly stable as a result of increasingly disentangled representation spaces"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in neighboring papers about VVS manifold disentanglement; this appears to be specific to this work.
- Break condition: If neural representations from higher VVS regions do not show improved linear separability or if alignment does not translate to smoother decision surfaces.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neural guidance creates fundamentally different representational spaces compared to conventional regularization methods.
- Mechanism: Instead of arbitrary smoothing through weight decay or other regularization techniques, neural guidance transforms the representational space using principles embedded in the human visual system, leading to unique geometry that resists transfer attacks.
- Core assumption: The human visual system's representational space contains optimization principles that are not captured by standard DNN architectures or training methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the resulting representational spaces differ in important ways from those produced by conventional smoothing methods"
  - [section] "neural guidance differs from more conventional methods of inducing smooth decision surfaces in that neural guidance ultimately leads to less susceptibility to transfer attacks"
  - [corpus] Neighboring papers focus on matrix manifolds and generalized biases but don't specifically address neural-guidance versus conventional regularization differences.
- Break condition: If neural-guided models show similar susceptibility to transfer attacks as weight-decay regularized models at comparable smoothness levels.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neural guidance induces a shape bias that contributes to robustness against texture-based adversarial perturbations.
- Mechanism: As DNNs align with higher VVS regions, they shift from texture-based to shape-based decision-making, making them less vulnerable to adversarial examples that primarily manipulate texture.
- Core assumption: Human visual robustness partly stems from shape-based recognition, and this property can be transferred to DNNs through neural guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These neural-guided models also exhibit a gradual shift towards more human-like decision-making patterns"
  - [section] "neurally-guided models, especially those guided by higher regions, indeed exhibited a higher tendency towards shape-based decision-making"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in neighboring papers about shape bias transfer through neural guidance.
- Break condition: If shape bias does not correlate with improved robustness or if shape-biased models perform worse on tasks requiring texture discrimination.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Ventral Visual Stream (VVS) hierarchy and its role in object recognition
  - Why needed here: Understanding the progression from V1 through higher regions (VO, PHC, LO, TO) is essential for grasping why neural guidance works hierarchically
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes the representational properties of V1 from those of higher-order regions like TO in terms of invariance and category separation?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks and their relationship to model decision surfaces
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is improving robustness against attacks that exploit irregular decision surfaces
  - Quick check question: How do adversarial examples exploit the geometry of a model's representational space, and why would smoother surfaces be more robust?

- Concept: Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and manifold geometry
  - Why needed here: RSA is used to demonstrate that neural-guided models have fundamentally different representational spaces from conventional models
  - Quick check question: What does a high Spearman's ρ correlation between two models' RDMs indicate about their representational similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Neural predictors: ResNet18-based feature extractors trained to predict neural responses from each VVS region
  - Main model: ResNet18 backbone with dual heads (task head for classification, neural head for representation learning)
  - Training loop: Simultaneous optimization of classification loss and neural alignment loss
  - Baseline models: None (classification only), Random (untrained neural head), V1-shuffle/TO-shuffle (shuffled neural guidance)

- Critical path:
  1. Train neural predictors on NSD fMRI data for each VVS region
  2. Prepare ImageNet-50 dataset (subset matching NSD categories)
  3. Train seven neural-guided models, each aligned with one VVS region
  4. Evaluate adversarial robustness across multiple attack types
  5. Analyze smoothness, shape bias, and representational similarity

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost: Training neural predictors requires substantial fMRI data and computational resources
  - Data alignment: ImageNet-50 subset must closely match NSD categories for effective transfer
  - Hyperparameter sensitivity: Neural guidance weight (α) must balance classification and neural alignment objectives

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor neural predictor quality (low Pearson's r correlation) → ineffective guidance
  - No hierarchical robustness improvement → alignment not capturing VVS properties
  - Similar smoothness to weight-decay models but worse robustness → missing key geometric properties
  - Transfer attack success → representational space not fundamentally different

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate neural predictors on Subject-1 NSD data; verify correlation with ground truth neural responses exceeds shuffled baselines
  2. Train V1-guided model and compare smoothness scores and robustness to baseline "None" model
  3. Conduct representational similarity analysis between neural-guided and baseline models to confirm different representational geometries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the hierarchical robustness improvement persist when using neural guidance with regions beyond the ventral visual stream, such as dorsal stream areas involved in motion processing?
- What specific mechanisms in the ventral visual stream create the increasingly robust representations that neural guidance can leverage?
- Can neural guidance be effectively combined with other robustness techniques like adversarial training to create models with even greater robustness?

## Limitations
- The study relies on fMRI data from a single subject (Subject-1), raising questions about generalizability across individuals
- Neural predictors achieve moderate correlations (r = 0.39-0.47) with ground truth neural responses, suggesting they capture only partial variance in the neural data
- The ImageNet-50 subset represents a significant reduction from full ImageNet, potentially limiting ecological validity of robustness improvements

## Confidence
- High confidence: The hierarchical improvement in robustness across VVS regions is well-supported by quantitative results (Fig. 2) and consistent across multiple attack types
- Medium confidence: The claim about fundamentally different representational spaces is supported by RSA analysis but would benefit from additional geometric characterization (e.g., manifold curvature, intrinsic dimensionality)
- Medium confidence: The shape bias findings show statistical significance but the practical impact on robustness needs further exploration across diverse datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test neural-guided models on a completely different image dataset (e.g., natural scenes not represented in NSD) to assess generalization of robustness improvements beyond the training distribution
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the neural guidance weight α to identify the optimal balance between classification accuracy and robustness, and to understand the tradeoff dynamics
3. Compare neural-guided models against state-of-the-art certified defenses to establish their position in the current robustness landscape and identify specific attack types where they excel or underperform
