# Against The Achilles' Heel: A Survey on Red Teaming for Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.00629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00629
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of red teaming methods for generative models, organizing over 120 papers into a taxonomy grounded in language model capabilities

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive examination of red teaming methods for generative models, covering over 120 papers to create a structured review of prompt attacks on large language models and vision-language models. The work introduces a "searcher" framework that unifies automatic red teaming as a search problem with three components: state space, search goal, and search operation. Key findings include the effectiveness of multilingual attacks in low-resource languages, the reliability of adversarial suffixes for jailbreaking models, and the vulnerability of safety alignment to minimal fine-tuning data.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews and synthesizes existing literature on red teaming for generative models, developing a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies grounded in language model capabilities. It introduces the "searcher" framework to unify automatic red teaming approaches and covers emerging areas including multilingual and multimodal attacks, overkill of harmless queries, and risks in LLM-based applications. The methodology involves extensive literature review, taxonomy development, framework creation, and analysis of future research directions.

## Key Results
- Multilingual attacks are more effective in low-resource languages compared to high-resource languages
- Adversarial suffixes can reliably jailbreak models across different architectures
- Fine-tuning with minimal data can severely compromise safety alignment in language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's comprehensive coverage of over 120 papers provides a holistic understanding of the red teaming landscape for generative models.
- Mechanism: By systematically examining attack strategies, evaluation benchmarks, defense methods, and emerging areas, the survey offers a unified perspective that bridges the gap between different aspects of red teaming.
- Core assumption: A thorough review of existing literature can identify key trends, gaps, and future directions in the field.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our extensive survey, which examines over 120 papers..."
  - [section]: "In this paper, we have surveyed 129 papers and addressed these gaps by providing a thorough and structured review of prompt attacks on LLMs and VLMs."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus only shows 8 related papers, none of which directly support the claim of comprehensiveness based on 120+ papers surveyed.
- Break condition: If the surveyed papers do not adequately represent the diversity of approaches and emerging areas in red teaming, the claim of comprehensiveness would be weakened.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The "searcher" framework unifies automatic red teaming approaches by framing them as search problems with three components: state space, search goal, and search operation.
- Mechanism: This abstraction allows for a systematic comparison and analysis of different search-based methods, revealing their underlying similarities and differences.
- Core assumption: Different automatic red teaming methods can be decomposed into these three fundamental components, enabling a unified framework.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, we have developed the "searcher" framework to unify various automatic red teaming approaches."
  - [section]: "We frame automated red-teaming methods as searching problems and analogously decouple popular search methods into three components of state space, search goal, and search operation..."
  - [corpus]: Missing. The corpus does not provide direct evidence for this specific framework.
- Break condition: If some automatic red teaming methods cannot be adequately described using this three-component framework, the claim of unification would be undermined.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey's taxonomy of attack strategies, grounded in language model capabilities, provides a fundamental and extensible classification system.
- Mechanism: By linking attack strategies to inherent model capabilities (e.g., autoregressive generation, instruction following, generalization), the taxonomy offers a deeper understanding of why certain attacks work and how they might be extended to different modalities.
- Core assumption: Attack strategies exploit specific capabilities developed during model training, and these capabilities can be used to categorize attacks systematically.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our main contributions are: We cover the full pipeline from risk taxonomy, attack method, evaluation, and defense, offering a cohesive narrative of the LLM safety landscape. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM attack strategies grounded in the inherent capabilities of models developed during pretraining and fine-tuning..."
  - [section]: "It is the inherent capabilities of language models that common strategies for jailbreak prompts exploit... Most generative language models are pretrained with autoregressive modeling, which endows them with a tendency to complete the previous context."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus does not directly address the taxonomy grounded in model capabilities.
- Break condition: If attack strategies emerge that do not exploit known model capabilities or if the taxonomy fails to capture the nuances of different attack approaches, its fundamental nature would be questioned.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Language model capabilities (e.g., autoregressive generation, instruction following, generalization)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these capabilities is crucial for comprehending why certain attack strategies work and how they can be classified systematically.
  - Quick check question: How does a language model's autoregressive nature contribute to completion compliance attacks?

- Concept: Search problems and their components (state space, search goal, search operation)
  - Why needed here: Framing automatic red teaming as search problems allows for a systematic analysis of different methods and reveals underlying similarities and differences.
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of the "searcher" framework, and how do they relate to automatic red teaming methods?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for red teaming (e.g., attack success rate, transferability, harmfulness)
  - Why needed here: Proper evaluation is essential for assessing the effectiveness of attack methods and the robustness of defenses.
  - Quick check question: What are the key dimensions that define the success of an attack, and how are they measured?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Literature review -> Taxonomy development -> Framework creation -> Emerging areas analysis -> Future directions identification
- Critical path: 1) Literature review and selection of relevant papers 2) Development of attack strategy taxonomy 3) Creation of "searcher" framework 4) Analysis of emerging areas 5) Identification of future research directions
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Comprehensiveness vs. depth: Balancing coverage of many papers with in-depth analysis of key approaches
  - Abstraction vs. specificity: Creating a general framework while maintaining relevance to specific methods
  - Theoretical grounding vs. practical applicability: Ensuring the taxonomy and framework are both conceptually sound and useful for practitioners
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent or incomplete coverage of literature
  - Taxonomy that fails to capture the nuances of different attack strategies
  - Framework that does not adequately describe all automatic red teaming methods
  - Insufficient attention to emerging areas or future directions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the taxonomy by applying it to a set of unseen attack strategies and assessing its ability to classify them correctly.
  2. Test the "searcher" framework by mapping existing automatic red teaming methods to its components and evaluating the clarity of the resulting descriptions.
  3. Assess the comprehensiveness of the survey by comparing its coverage to a random sample of recent papers in the field and measuring the overlap.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Based on the paper "Against The Achilles' Heel: A Survey on Red Teaming for Generative Models", here are some key open research questions:

1. How can we systematically explore the large susceptible area of safety risks in language models, given the vast amount of pretraining data from different domains and the generalization capability of these models?

2. What are the best practices for establishing standard evaluation metrics and frameworks to fairly compare different safety benchmarks and attack methods?

3. How can we sample a subset of existing benchmarks to reach similar evaluation results as using the whole, addressing the issue of data homogeneity between various benchmarks?

4. What are effective and generalizable defense methods against weight-poisoning backdoor attacks for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models?

5. How can we develop and implement safety protocols that are robust to multilingual contexts, addressing the challenges of multilingual safety alignment?

6. What are the best strategies for defending against multimodal attacks that combine data in multiple modalities, such as text and images?

7. How can we effectively defend against jailbreak attacks that exploit the generation capability of large language models, even when users do not intend to jailbreak them?

8. What are the most effective approaches for safeguarding large language models against fine-tuning attacks that compromise safety alignment, even when using non-harmful data?

9. How can we develop a systematic strategy to defend LLM-based applications against attacks through any component of the system, without hurting the overall performance?

10. What are the best practices for evaluating the safety of LLM-based applications, considering both the LLM outputs and the possible effects they apply after interacting with environments or executing tools?

## Limitations

- The claim of comprehensive coverage of over 120 papers is not well-supported by available corpus evidence
- Some automatic red teaming methods may not fit neatly into the three-component "searcher" framework
- The taxonomy's extensibility to emerging attack strategies and non-text modalities remains unproven

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The survey successfully identifies and categorizes attack strategies based on language model capabilities
- **Medium confidence**: The "searcher" framework provides a useful abstraction for automatic red teaming methods
- **Low confidence**: The claim of comprehensive coverage is not well-supported by available evidence, and the taxonomy's extensibility to emerging attack strategies remains unproven

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus Coverage Validation**: Perform an independent literature review to verify the claimed 120+ paper coverage and identify any significant gaps in methodology, attack strategies, or defense mechanisms.

2. **Framework Generality Test**: Apply the "searcher" framework to a set of recently published automatic red teaming methods not included in the original survey, assessing whether all methods can be adequately described using the three-component structure.

3. **Cross-Modal Extension**: Test the attack strategy taxonomy by attempting to apply it to non-text modalities (e.g., image, audio) and document cases where the framework either succeeds or fails to capture attack mechanisms.
