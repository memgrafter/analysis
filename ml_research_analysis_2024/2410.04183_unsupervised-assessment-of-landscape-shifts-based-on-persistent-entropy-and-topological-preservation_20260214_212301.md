# Unsupervised Assessment of Landscape Shifts Based on Persistent Entropy and Topological Preservation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04183
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04183
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SOM-based persistent entropy framework outperforms PCA and Kernel PCA for detecting topological shifts in continual learning scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting distribution shifts in continual learning by integrating persistent homology and persistent entropy. The approach projects high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), which preserves topological characteristics, and then analyzes changes in topological features using persistent entropy. The framework delivers a p-value score using the Mann-Whitney U test, enabling robust detection of drifts. Evaluation on synthetic MNIST-based data streams shows that SOM-based methods outperform linear projections like PCA in detecting topological shifts, demonstrating the potential of persistent entropy for shift detection.

## Method Summary
The framework detects distribution shifts by projecting high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction techniques (SOM, PCA, or Kernel PCA), computing distance matrices from data centroids, applying persistent homology to calculate persistent entropy for each data chunk, and using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare consecutive chunks for statistical significance. The process uses the first 20% of data for training the DR methods, then processes subsequent chunks to detect shifts based on p-value thresholds.

## Key Results
- SOM-based persistent entropy detection outperforms PCA and Kernel PCA on synthetic MNIST data with injected topological shifts
- The framework successfully identifies shifts when data transitions between digit groups with different hole counts (0, 1, or 2 holes)
- Different chunk sizes (50, 100, 250) affect detection sensitivity and computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Persistent entropy captures topological changes in data streams better than statistical measures alone.
- Mechanism: Persistent homology tracks k-dimensional features across multiple scales, and persistent entropy summarizes this information into a single value reflecting the distribution of topological features.
- Core assumption: Topological features that persist across multiple scales indicate meaningful structure, while transient features are noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Persistent Entropy, based in Shannon entropy, provides a summary of the information derived from persistent homology"
  - [section 2.2] "Persistent Entropy, based in Shannon entropy, provides a summary of the geometric information derived from the topological features of a cloud of points"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers mention topological analysis but don't directly validate persistent entropy effectiveness
- Break condition: If topological features are not persistent across scales or if noise dominates the signal, persistent entropy becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-Organizing Maps preserve topological structure during dimensionality reduction.
- Mechanism: SOM projects high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional grid while maintaining neighborhood relationships, creating a topology-preserving embedding.
- Core assumption: Preserving local neighborhood structure in the input space translates to preserving topological features in the latent space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)...is a mapping technique to reduce dimensionality while preserving the topological characteristics of the input space"
  - [section 2.2] "SOM is a two-layered neural network that transforms intricate relationships among high-dimensional data into straightforward geometric relationships on a standard lattice"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work uses SOM for topology-preserving projections
- Break condition: If the data has complex non-linear structures that cannot be captured by the grid topology, or if the SOM parameters are poorly chosen.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mann-Whitney U test on persistent entropy values provides robust drift detection.
- Mechanism: Non-parametric statistical testing compares persistent entropy distributions between consecutive data chunks, identifying significant topological shifts.
- Core assumption: Changes in persistent entropy distribution indicate meaningful changes in data topology rather than random variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "The framework delivers results using a p-value score. When each chunk of data arrives, a non-parametric statistical test is performed"
  - [section 4.4] "We also use the same MNIST data to evaluate PCA and Kernel-PCA as drift detector tools"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't provide validation of Mann-Whitney U test effectiveness
- Break condition: If persistent entropy changes are gradual rather than sudden, or if the chunk size is inappropriate for the drift characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Persistent homology and its relationship to algebraic topology
  - Why needed here: Understanding how topological features are tracked across scales is fundamental to grasping why persistent entropy works
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of topological features tracked by persistent homology?

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction techniques and their impact on topological preservation
  - Why needed here: Different DR methods (SOM, PCA, Kernel PCA) have different effects on topological structure
  - Quick check question: How does linear projection (PCA) differ from topology-preserving methods like SOM in terms of neighborhood relationships?

- Concept: Statistical hypothesis testing for non-parametric data
  - Why needed here: Mann-Whitney U test is used to determine significance of persistent entropy changes
  - Quick check question: What assumptions does the Mann-Whitney U test make about the data distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data → Dimensionality reduction (SOM/PCA/Kernel PCA) → Distance matrix computation → Persistent homology → Persistent entropy → Mann-Whitney U test → p-value output
- Critical path: DR → Persistent homology → Persistent entropy → Statistical test
- Design tradeoffs: SOM provides better topology preservation but is computationally heavier than PCA; chunk size affects sensitivity to drift
- Failure signatures: High p-values consistently (no drift detection when there should be), low p-values consistently (false alarms), computational slowness with large datasets
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the framework on synthetic data with known topological shifts (like MNIST digits with hole variations) to verify detection
  2. Compare SOM vs PCA vs Kernel PCA performance on the same dataset to validate topology preservation importance
  3. Vary chunk size and observe impact on detection sensitivity and false alarm rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the chunk size affect the accuracy and speed of detecting topological drifts using persistent entropy and SOM projections?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of chunk size on the quality of geometric pattern analysis and provides experimental results comparing different chunk sizes (50, 100, 250) for SOM, PCA, and Kernel PCA methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results for three specific chunk sizes and does not explore a broader range or provide a definitive optimal chunk size.
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional experiments with a wider range of chunk sizes, including very small and very large values, would help determine the optimal chunk size for balancing detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed framework compare to existing concept drift detection methods in terms of performance and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a novel approach to concept drift detection using persistent entropy and SOM projections, but does not directly compare its performance to other state-of-the-art methods.
- Why unresolved: Without a direct comparison, it is unclear how the proposed framework performs relative to existing methods in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rates, and computational cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive experimental study comparing the proposed framework to other popular concept drift detection methods on a variety of benchmark datasets would provide a clear understanding of its relative performance and efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the proposed framework to noise and anomalies in the data stream?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the MNIST dataset used for experiments contains some anomalous digits with unexpected numbers of holes, but does not thoroughly investigate the framework's robustness to such noise.
- Why unresolved: The impact of noise and anomalies on the framework's ability to accurately detect topological drifts is not well understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with datasets containing varying levels of noise and anomalies, along with sensitivity analyses, would help determine the framework's robustness and identify potential failure modes.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends heavily on dimensionality reduction method choice and its ability to preserve topological features
- Performance comparison limited to synthetic MNIST data with controlled topological shifts, not validated on diverse real-world datasets
- Computational efficiency for large-scale applications and sensitivity to parameter choices remain unexplored

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical foundation of persistent homology and its application to drift detection is well-established
- **Medium confidence**: SOM superiority over linear methods for topology preservation is demonstrated on synthetic data but needs real-world validation
- **Low confidence**: Mann-Whitney U test robustness for persistent entropy in noisy environments and optimal parameter selection are uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world data validation**: Apply the framework to real-world datasets with known concept drifts (e.g., financial data, sensor streams) to verify performance beyond synthetic MNIST data

2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Conduct systematic experiments varying SOM parameters (grid size, learning rate) and chunk sizes to identify optimal configurations for different drift characteristics

3. **Computational scalability testing**: Evaluate the framework's performance on large-scale datasets to assess computational efficiency and identify bottlenecks in the pipeline
