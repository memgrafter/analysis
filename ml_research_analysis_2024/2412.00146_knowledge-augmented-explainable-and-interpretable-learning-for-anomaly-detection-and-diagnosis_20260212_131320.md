# Knowledge-Augmented Explainable and Interpretable Learning for Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00146
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00146
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Combines knowledge-based and data-driven methods to achieve 0.85-0.90 accuracy in industrial logistics anomaly detection while maintaining interpretability

## Executive Summary
This chapter presents three knowledge-augmented approaches for explainable and interpretable learning in anomaly detection and diagnosis. The methods combine symbolic knowledge representation with data-driven learning to enhance transparency and provide actionable insights in high-risk domains. The work demonstrates how domain knowledge formalized in knowledge graphs can guide pattern mining, refine diagnostic scoring systems, and provide causal explanations for neural network classifications. The approaches collectively show that integrating knowledge-based and data-driven methods can achieve high accuracy while maintaining the interpretability necessary for critical applications in industrial logistics, medical diagnosis, and automotive fault detection.

## Method Summary
The chapter describes three main approaches for knowledge-augmented learning in anomaly detection and diagnosis. First, knowledge-augmented pattern mining uses subgroup discovery with domain knowledge formalized in knowledge graphs to identify exceptional patterns in industrial logistics data, achieving 0.85-0.90 accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Second, semi-automatic learning and refinement of diagnostic scoring systems in medical domains learns initial rules by estimating association strength between findings and diagnoses, then refines them through interactive pattern mining, reducing rule base complexity from approximately 11 to 2 rules per diagnosis while preserving accuracy. Third, a neuro-symbolic fault diagnosis system for automotive applications integrates knowledge graphs with explainable deep learning, using saliency maps and causal graph traversal to provide interpretable root cause analysis for time series sensor data.

## Key Results
- Knowledge-augmented pattern mining achieves 0.85-0.90 accuracy in industrial logistics anomaly detection while maintaining interpretability
- Diagnostic scoring system refinement reduces rule base complexity from ~11 to ~2 rules per diagnosis while preserving accuracy
- Neuro-symbolic fault diagnosis system provides interpretable root cause analysis through saliency maps and causal graph traversal for automotive applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge-augmented pattern mining improves anomaly detection accuracy while maintaining interpretability.
- Mechanism: By integrating domain knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs) with subgroup discovery, the system can identify exceptional patterns that are both statistically significant and contextually meaningful, reducing false positives from purely data-driven approaches.
- Core assumption: Domain knowledge accurately represents the underlying system structure and relationships between components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "three main approaches are covered: (1) knowledge-augmented pattern mining using subgroup discovery for industrial logistics anomaly detection, achieving improved interpretability while maintaining high accuracy (0.85-0.90)"
  - [section] "Using a given subgroup discovery algorithm... the result of top-k subgroup discovery is then the set of the k patterns p1, ..., pk, where pi ∈ 2∆, with the highest interestingness value according to the applied quality function."
- Break condition: If domain knowledge is incomplete, outdated, or contains incorrect assumptions about system behavior, the augmented patterns may miss genuine anomalies or generate false positives.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neuro-symbolic approaches combine the pattern recognition strengths of deep learning with the interpretability of symbolic reasoning.
- Mechanism: The knowledge graph guides the diagnostic process by narrowing the search space for the neural network, while the neural network's classification results (with saliency maps) provide actionable evidence that can be traced back through the knowledge graph's causal relationships.
- Core assumption: The causal relationships encoded in the knowledge graph accurately reflect how anomalies propagate through the system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "(3) a neuro-symbolic fault diagnosis system for automotive applications that integrates knowledge graphs with explainable deep learning, providing interpretable root cause analysis through saliency maps and causal graph traversal."
  - [section] "The fault diagnosis system is applicable in a variety of domains in which the following conditions are met: The system to be diagnosed consists of multiple components with causal relationships between one another..."
- Break condition: If the knowledge graph's causal relationships are inaccurate or incomplete, the system may trace errors to incorrect root causes, undermining trust in the diagnosis.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diagnostic scoring systems can be learned and refined using statistical associations while maintaining human interpretability.
- Mechanism: Initial scoring rules are learned by estimating association strength between findings and diagnoses, then refined through interactive pattern mining that identifies incorrect predictions, allowing domain experts to adjust the rule base while preserving transparency.
- Core assumption: The statistical associations between findings and diagnoses remain stable enough over time to be captured in a rule-based system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "(2) semi-automatic learning and refinement of diagnostic scoring systems in medical domains, reducing rule base complexity from ~11 to ~2 rules per diagnosis while preserving accuracy"
  - [section] "The approach described in [49] aims to learn diagnostic scoring rules in a data-driven way by estimating the association strength between all findings f ∈ ΩF and all diagnoses d ∈ ΩD"
- Break condition: If the diagnostic domain experiences rapid changes in symptom-disease relationships, the learned rules may become outdated and require frequent retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Subgroup discovery and quality functions
  - Why needed here: Understanding how patterns are evaluated for "interestingness" is crucial for knowledge-augmented pattern mining approaches
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the Piatetsky-Shapiro quality function and the gain quality function in subgroup discovery?

- Concept: Knowledge graph structure and SPARQL querying
  - Why needed here: Essential for implementing neuro-symbolic approaches where the knowledge graph guides diagnostic processes
  - Quick check question: How would you represent causal relationships between components in a knowledge graph for fault diagnosis?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and class activation mapping (CAM)
  - Why needed here: Critical for understanding how the neuro-symbolic approach generates explanations for time series classifications
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Grad-CAM and SmoothGrad techniques for generating saliency maps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing layer (normalization, discretization) -> Knowledge graph integration module -> Subgroup discovery engine with quality functions -> Neural network classification component -> Saliency map generation module -> Root cause analysis and explanation generation -> Interactive refinement interface

- Critical path: Data → Knowledge Graph Query → Neural Classification → Saliency Map Generation → Causal Graph Traversal → Explanation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. detection accuracy: More interpretable models may sacrifice some detection performance
  - Knowledge graph completeness vs. system complexity: More comprehensive knowledge graphs improve guidance but increase maintenance overhead
  - Rule base simplicity vs. diagnostic coverage: Simpler scoring systems are more interpretable but may miss complex patterns

- Failure signatures:
  - High false positive rate: Knowledge graph may contain incorrect causal relationships
  - Poor detection of novel anomalies: Subgroup discovery quality functions may not capture emerging patterns
  - Uninterpretable explanations: Neural network architecture or CAM generation may not align with knowledge graph structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic subgroup discovery on synthetic logistics data with predefined patterns to verify quality function behavior
  2. Create a small knowledge graph with causal relationships and test root cause analysis on simulated fault propagation
  3. Train a simple CNN on time series data and implement Grad-CAM to verify saliency map generation works with your data format

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can knowledge graphs be directly integrated into pattern mining algorithms for anomaly detection rather than just providing features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Potential extensions of such knowledge-augmented analysis method can consider the graph structures directly, for detecting according graph patterns"
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions this as a future direction without specifying implementation approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of pattern mining algorithms that operate directly on graph structures rather than tabular data derived from graphs

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between rule base complexity and diagnostic accuracy when refining scoring systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "applying domain knowledge can significantly reduce the number of learned rules... the accuracy is also reduced slightly" and "the rule base is further reduced so that only the 'more meaningful' rules remain"
- Why unresolved: The paper shows trade-offs exist but doesn't quantify the optimal balance point for different domains
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation across multiple domains showing accuracy reduction versus interpretability gains at different pruning levels

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the neuro-symbolic fault diagnosis framework be systematically evaluated using synthetic problem instances?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We are planning to work on a further generalization of the neuro-symbolic diagnosis framework... as well as a systematic evaluation of its architecture using randomized, parameterized and domain-agnostic synthetic problem instances"
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as future work without presenting any evaluation methodology
- What evidence would resolve it: Framework that generates synthetic diagnostic problems with known ground truth solutions and demonstrates the system's performance across varied parameter settings

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy metrics (0.85-0.90) without detailed analysis of precision-recall tradeoffs or false positive/negative distributions
- Neuro-symbolic approach lacks specific architectural details and comprehensive validation procedures beyond basic accuracy measures
- Methods rely heavily on the completeness and accuracy of domain knowledge representations, which are not validated against ground truth system behaviors

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (knowledge-augmented pattern mining): Medium confidence - supported by abstract claims but lacks detailed validation data
- Mechanism 2 (neuro-symbolic integration): Low confidence - methodologically sound but insufficiently validated with comprehensive metrics
- Mechanism 3 (scoring system refinement): Medium confidence - demonstrated reduction in complexity but limited evaluation of diagnostic performance

## Next Checks
1. Validate knowledge graph completeness by testing the system's ability to detect anomalies in edge cases where relationships between components are not explicitly encoded
2. Conduct ablation studies on the neuro-symbolic system by comparing performance with and without knowledge graph guidance across different automotive fault scenarios
3. Implement cross-validation on the diagnostic scoring system refinement approach using medical datasets with known ground truth to verify that accuracy is preserved during rule base simplification
