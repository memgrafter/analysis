# Machine Translation Models are Zero-Shot Detectors of Translation Direction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.06769
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06769
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Primary result**: Unsupervised NMT-based method achieves 82-96% document-level accuracy for NMT translations and 60-81% for human translations across 20 translation directions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach to detecting the translation direction of parallel text using multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) models. The method compares conditional probabilities p(translation|original) and p(original|translation) computed by NMT models, leveraging the simplification effects in translationese that make original text more probable than its translation. Experiments with three multilingual NMT models on 20 translation directions show competitive performance with supervised baselines, achieving 82-96% document-level accuracy for NMT-produced translations and 60-81% for human translations. The approach is applied to a real-world forensic case, supporting the hypothesis that an English book was forged to discredit a German PhD thesis.

## Method Summary
The approach uses multilingual NMT models to estimate conditional probabilities in both translation directions. For each sentence pair (x,y), the model computes token-level log-probabilities P(y|x) and P(x|y), averages them over sentence length, and predicts the direction with higher probability. Document-level detection aggregates these probabilities across all sentences in documents with ≥10 sentences. The method requires no labeled training data and works with any multilingual NMT model, though directional bias must be measured and potentially corrected. The core assumption is that translationese exhibits measurable statistical differences that NMT models encode in their probability distributions.

## Key Results
- NMT-based method achieves 82-96% document-level accuracy for NMT translations and 60-81% for human translations across 20 language pairs
- Performance improves significantly with text length, reaching competitive accuracy at 60-70 characters per sentence
- The approach is competitive with supervised baselines while requiring no labeled training data
- Applied successfully to a forensic case, supporting the hypothesis that an English book was forged to discredit a German PhD thesis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NMT models assign higher conditional probabilities to original text than to its translation
- Mechanism: NMT models trained on large parallel corpora learn to reproduce translationese patterns. When evaluating a text pair, the model computes p(translation|original) and p(original|translation). If trained primarily on translations from X to Y, it assigns higher probability to text following translationese norms in Y when conditioned on text in X.
- Core assumption: Translationese exhibits measurable statistical differences from original text, and NMT models encode these differences in their probability distributions
- Evidence anchors: "motivated by the well-known simplification effect in translationese or machine-translationese"; experimental results showing directional probability differences
- Break condition: If translationese effects are minimal for a language pair, or if the NMT model was trained on balanced original/translation data, the probability difference may disappear

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Translation direction detection accuracy increases with text length
- Mechanism: Longer texts provide more statistical evidence for translationese patterns. Short sentences may lack sufficient context for the model to distinguish original from translation, while longer passages accumulate more evidence of simplification, normalization, and interference effects.
- Core assumption: Translationese effects compound across sentence boundaries and become more detectable in longer texts
- Evidence anchors: "our findings show that an average accuracy comparable to that reported in Table 3 is attained starting at a sentence length between 60 and 70 characters"; robust accuracy for human translations
- Break condition: If translationese effects are localized to specific constructions rather than distributed across text, longer texts may not provide additional benefit

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NMT models exhibit directional bias based on training data imbalance
- Mechanism: When training data contains more X→Y examples than Y→X, the model learns stronger representations for the dominant direction. This manifests as consistently higher probabilities for one direction regardless of the actual translation direction in test data.
- Core assumption: Training data imbalance creates systematic bias in the model's probability estimates that can be measured and potentially corrected
- Evidence anchors: "A multilingual translation model (or a pair of bilingual models) may consistently assign higher probabilities in one translation direction than the other"; bias measured via accuracy differences between gold directions
- Break condition: If training data is perfectly balanced or if the model architecture inherently prevents directional bias, this mechanism would not apply

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Conditional probability estimation in autoregressive models
  - Why needed here: The core detection method relies on comparing p(y|x) and p(x|y) from NMT models
  - Quick check question: How does an autoregressive model compute the probability of a sequence given another sequence?

- Concept: Translationese characteristics and their linguistic basis
  - Why needed here: Understanding why translationese differs from original text is crucial for interpreting detection results
  - Quick check question: What linguistic features typically distinguish translated text from original text?

- Concept: Document-level probability aggregation
  - Why needed here: The method extends from sentence-level to document-level by averaging token-level probabilities across multiple sentences
  - Quick check question: How does averaging token-level probabilities across a document affect the detection signal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - NMT model(s) for probability estimation -> Probability aggregation logic (sentence vs document level) -> Direction comparison mechanism -> Bias measurement and correction (optional) -> Evaluation framework

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained NMT model(s)
  2. Tokenize input text pairs
  3. Compute conditional probabilities in both directions
  4. Compare probabilities to determine direction
  5. Aggregate results for document-level detection
  6. Measure and report bias if needed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sentence-level vs document-level detection: sentence-level is faster but less accurate; document-level requires alignment but more reliable
  - Single vs multiple NMT models: single model is simpler but may have bias; multiple models can average out bias but require more resources
  - Probability averaging vs other normalization: averaging is simple but may not handle length effects optimally

- Failure signatures:
  - Consistently predicting one direction regardless of input (high bias)
  - Accuracy near chance level for pre-NMT translations
  - Performance dropping significantly for short texts
  - Directional bias that doesn't correlate with expected training data imbalance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on sentence pairs with known direction to verify basic functionality
  2. Measure directional bias on balanced test set to establish baseline
  3. Compare sentence-level vs document-level accuracy on same data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed unsupervised approach generalize to document-level translation detection, or is it limited to sentence-level analysis?
- Basis in paper: The paper primarily focuses on sentence-level classification and mentions document-level experiments only briefly, noting that accuracy increases with longer texts but not exploring this extensively
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests document-level classification on a limited set of language pairs and doesn't explore scenarios with non-1:1 sentence alignments or documents with varying lengths
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the approach on diverse document structures (including non-1:1 alignments), with varying document lengths, and across a broader range of language pairs would clarify its document-level capabilities

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the approach perform on low-resource languages, given that it requires parallel test data in both translation directions?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges this limitation in the "Limitations" section, noting that their experiments required test data for both translation directions and that reference translations for low-resource languages typically only exist in one direction
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't test the approach on low-resource languages due to data availability constraints, despite acknowledging this as a significant gap
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the approach on low-resource language pairs where parallel data exists in both directions (even if limited) would reveal whether performance degrades proportionally to the NMT model's quality for those languages

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can directional bias in NMT models be effectively mitigated to improve translation direction detection accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies directional bias as a significant issue, showing that models consistently assign higher probabilities in certain translation directions, and recommends being "mindful in the choice of NMT model" without exploring bias mitigation strategies
- Why unresolved: While the paper quantifies bias and notes its impact on accuracy, it only suggests future work should explore bias reduction through different normalization strategies or model training approaches, without implementing or testing these
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying bias correction techniques (such as model-specific bias terms or different probability normalization methods) and measuring their impact on detection accuracy would determine whether bias can be effectively mitigated

## Limitations

- **Model bias dependency**: The method's accuracy heavily depends on directional bias in NMT models, which varies significantly across language pairs and requires careful measurement and correction
- **Limited generalization to human translations**: Performance on human translations (60-81%) is substantially lower than on NMT outputs (82-96%), suggesting the approach may not generalize well to all types of translated text
- **Corpus-specific findings**: Validation is primarily based on WMT datasets and a single forensic case, with performance on other corpora and domains remaining untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using conditional probability differences for direction detection is well-supported by experimental results across multiple models and language pairs
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the method on longer texts and its superiority over supervised baselines is supported by the data, but underlying reasons are not fully explored
- **Low confidence**: The forensic application to the German PhD thesis case represents a single real-world example without systematic validation of reliability in actual forensic scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-corpus validation**: Test the method on diverse translation corpora beyond WMT datasets, including different domains (literary, technical, legal) and language pairs not covered in current experiments to establish robustness across varied translation contexts

2. **Bias characterization study**: Conduct systematic analysis of how training data composition (original vs. translated text ratios, domain balance) affects directional bias in NMT models to help predict which models are suitable for direction detection without extensive experimental validation

3. **Forensic reliability assessment**: Apply the method to multiple forensic cases with known translation directions to evaluate reliability and consistency in real-world scenarios, including analysis of false positive/negative rates and confidence measures for individual detection decisions
