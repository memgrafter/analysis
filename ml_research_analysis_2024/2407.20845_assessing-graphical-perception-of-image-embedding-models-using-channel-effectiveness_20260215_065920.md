# Assessing Graphical Perception of Image Embedding Models using Channel Effectiveness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.20845
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20845
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CLIP models show different channel accuracy rankings than human perception, with color luminance having the lowest linearity, suggesting limitations for precise chart interpretation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework to evaluate the graphical perception capabilities of image embedding models by measuring channel effectiveness across six visual channels (length, tilt, area, color luminance, saturation, and curvature). The authors generate synthetic charts with controlled variations and assess embeddings from CLIP models (ResNet50, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14@336px) using linearity analysis and discriminability metrics. Results reveal that CLIP's perception of channel accuracy differs from human perception, with color luminance showing particularly low linearity. The work highlights limitations in using general vision models for precise chart interpretation and suggests different requirements for chart question answering versus captioning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors generate synthetic chart images with controlled variations across six visual channels (length, tilt, area, color luminance, saturation, and curvature), creating 1000 steps per channel with fixed control variables. They extract embeddings using three CLIP model variants (RN50x64, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14@336px) and analyze linearity through principal component analysis to assess channel accuracy. Discriminability is evaluated by computing Euclidean distances between consecutive embeddings with Gaussian smoothing to identify perceptual thresholds. The framework provides quantitative metrics for comparing model performance against human perception in visualization tasks.

## Key Results
- CLIP models rank channel accuracy differently than human perception, with length and tilt being most accurately perceived while color luminance shows the lowest linearity
- Discriminability analysis reveals distinct perceptual thresholds for different channels, with some channels showing higher sensitivity to changes than others
- CLIP's linearity scores fall below ideal values, indicating limitations for precise quantitative analysis tasks in charts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linearity of image embeddings serves as a reliable proxy for channel accuracy in vision models.
- Mechanism: The authors measure how well the perceived magnitude in the embedding space aligns with the actual stimulus magnitude. If the embedding space changes proportionally with the stimulus, it indicates accurate channel perception. This is tested using principal component analysis (PCA) to observe if the first principal component can represent the distribution of embeddings linearly.
- Core assumption: The relationship between stimulus magnitude and embedding magnitude is linear for accurate channels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Channel accuracy is assessed through the linearity of embeddings, measuring how well the perceived magnitude aligns with the size of the stimulus."
  - [section 3.1.1]: "We then analyzed linearity using principal component analysis (PCA) [38], observing how well the first principal component could represent the distribution of embeddings."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The corpus does not provide direct support for this specific mechanism of using linearity as a proxy for accuracy.
- Break condition: If the embedding space does not change proportionally with stimulus magnitude, or if non-linear relationships dominate the perception of channels.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Euclidean distance between embeddings can be used to evaluate channel discriminability.
- Mechanism: By calculating the Euclidean distance between consecutive embeddings as the channel magnitude changes, the authors assess how well the model can differentiate between similar visual elements. Peaks in the distance graph indicate thresholds where the model perceives significant differences, reflecting discriminability.
- Core assumption: Greater Euclidean distance between embeddings corresponds to higher discriminability of the channel.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Discriminability is evaluated based on the distances between embeddings, indicating their distinctness."
  - [section 4]: "We measured the Euclidean distance between image embeddings, calculated with the best-performing model (ViT-L/14@336px), of each consecutive pair in a series of 1000 images..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The corpus does not provide direct support for this specific mechanism of using Euclidean distance to evaluate discriminability.
- Break condition: If the distance between embeddings does not correlate with perceived differences, or if other factors influence discriminability more significantly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CLIP's perception of channel accuracy and discriminability differs from human perception, affecting its utility in chart-related tasks.
- Mechanism: The authors find that CLIP's ranking of channel effectiveness does not align with human perception, and its linearity scores are below ideal. This discrepancy suggests that CLIP may not be suitable for tasks requiring human-like perception, such as chart captioning, or tasks requiring precise quantitative analysis, like chart question answering.
- Core assumption: Human perception is the benchmark for effective channel interpretation in visualization tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our experiments with the CLIP model show that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and shows unique discriminability in channels like length, tilt, and curvature."
  - [section 3.1.2]: "We can find that the order does not align with human perception for all models."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The corpus does not provide direct support for this specific mechanism of comparing CLIP's perception to human perception.
- Break condition: If CLIP's perception aligns more closely with human perception in future iterations, or if other models demonstrate better alignment with human perception.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Why needed here: PCA is used to analyze the linearity of embeddings by observing how well the first principal component represents the distribution of embeddings. This helps in quantifying the linearity of each channel's embedding space.
  - Quick check question: How does PCA help in determining the linearity of image embeddings in the context of channel effectiveness?

- Concept: Weber's Law
  - Why needed here: Weber's Law is referenced to explain why the model captures subtle changes well when the length is short, similar to human perception. It suggests that perceived changes in stimuli are proportional to the magnitude of the initial stimuli.
  - Quick check question: How does Weber's Law apply to the discriminability of visual channels in image embedding models?

- Concept: Euclidean Distance
  - Why needed here: Euclidean distance is used to measure the discriminability of channels by calculating the distance between consecutive embeddings. This helps in identifying thresholds where the model perceives significant differences.
  - Quick check question: Why is Euclidean distance a suitable metric for evaluating the discriminability of visual channels in image embedding models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image Generation -> Embedding Extraction -> Analysis Tools
- Critical path:
  1. Generate synthetic images with controlled channel variations
  2. Extract embeddings using CLIP models
  3. Analyze linearity using PCA to assess channel accuracy
  4. Calculate Euclidean distances between embeddings to evaluate discriminability
  5. Interpret results to understand model's graphical perception
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using synthetic images allows for controlled experiments but may not fully capture real-world complexities
  - Focusing on linearity and discriminability provides insights into channel effectiveness but may overlook other aspects like separability or popout
- Failure signatures:
  - Low linearity scores indicate poor channel accuracy, suggesting the model may not be suitable for precise quantitative tasks
  - Unexpected peaks in distance graphs may indicate perceptual thresholds that differ from human perception, affecting the model's utility in tasks requiring human-like interpretation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test linearity of embeddings for each channel with fixed control variables to establish baseline accuracy
  2. Explore linearity with every combination of controlled variables to assess generalizability across different scenarios
  3. Measure Euclidean distances between embeddings for incremental changes in each channel to evaluate discriminability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we establish a reliable visual encoder for chart-based tasks that balances high channel accuracy and discriminability to match human perception?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the need for different models for chart question answering (higher channel accuracy) and chart captioning (matching human discriminability), highlighting the current lack of reliable visual encoders for charts.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need but does not provide a definitive method or model architecture that successfully balances both accuracy and discriminability in a way that mimics human perception across all visual channels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of a visual encoder model that demonstrates high linearity (close to 1) across all channels and exhibits discriminability patterns that closely align with human perception thresholds, validated through human subject studies and quantitative comparisons.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the underlying reasons for CLIP's significantly lower linearity in color luminance compared to other channels, and how can this limitation be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that CLIP's color luminance channel shows the lowest linearity compared to other channels, suggesting potential misinterpretation of precise values encoded as color luminance.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the issue but does not explore the root causes or propose solutions to improve the model's perception of color luminance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigation into the model's training data, architecture, or attention mechanisms that contribute to poor luminance perception, followed by targeted modifications or fine-tuning strategies that improve linearity in this channel, validated through improved performance on luminance-based tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop a standardized benchmark that comprehensively evaluates channel effectiveness across multiple metrics such as separability, popout, grouping, and just-noticeable difference (JND), beyond accuracy and discriminability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest extending their framework to include additional metrics like separability, popout, grouping, and JND, which are crucial for understanding pre-attentive processing and graphical perception.
- Why unresolved: While the authors propose the idea, they do not provide a concrete methodology or implementation for such a comprehensive benchmark.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation of a standardized evaluation framework that includes these additional metrics, along with a dataset of stimuli and corresponding ground truth data, allowing for consistent and comparative assessment of various visual encoders' performance across all aspects of channel effectiveness.

## Limitations

- The use of synthetic images may not fully capture the complexities and variations present in real-world charts and visualizations
- The framework focuses primarily on linearity and discriminability metrics, potentially overlooking other important aspects of visual perception such as separability, popout, and grouping
- The assumption that human perception should be the benchmark for model performance may not hold for all chart-related tasks, particularly those requiring precise quantitative analysis

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodology for generating synthetic charts and extracting CLIP embeddings is clearly described and technically sound. The core finding that CLIP models show different channel accuracy rankings compared to human perception is well-supported by the empirical results.
- **Medium confidence**: The use of PCA linearity as a proxy for channel accuracy is reasonable but may not capture all aspects of perceptual accuracy. The discriminability analysis using Euclidean distances is methodologically sound but may oversimplify perceptual differences.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of these findings to real-world charts and the assumption that human perception should be the benchmark for model performance in all chart-related tasks.

## Next Checks

1. Validate linearity measurements by testing the same synthetic charts with additional embedding models (e.g., other vision-language models or traditional computer vision models) to determine if CLIP's linearity patterns are unique or representative.

2. Cross-validate discriminability findings by conducting human perceptual experiments on the same synthetic charts to compare human discrimination thresholds with the model's Euclidean distance patterns.

3. Test on real-world charts by applying the same analysis framework to actual data visualizations from common charting libraries to assess whether synthetic chart findings transfer to practical scenarios.
