## Executive Summary
SpikeVoice introduces a spiking neural network (SNN) model for high-quality text-to-speech synthesis, addressing the challenge of capturing long-term dependencies in SNNs due to their serial nature. The key innovation is the Spiking Temporal-Sequential Attention (STSA) mechanism, which performs temporal-mixing to access global information across time steps and sequential-mixing to integrate contextual information, resolving the "partial-time dependency" issue. Experiments on English and Chinese datasets (single and multi-speaker) show SpikeVoice achieves TTS performance close to artificial neural networks (ANNs) while consuming only 10.5% of the energy, with MOS scores comparable to ANN baselines and significantly lower firing rates.

## Method Summary
SpikeVoice is a spike-driven TTS model that implements the LIF neuron model with charge-fire-reset dynamics. The architecture consists of four main components: Spiking Phoneme Encoder (4 layers), Spiking Variance Adaptor (duration, pitch, energy predictors), Spiking Mel Decoder (6 layers), and Spiking PostNet. Each component uses STSA modules with temporal and sequential attention stages, and spiking feedforward modules with LIF neurons before convolutions. The model is trained on four datasets (LJSpeech, Baker, LibriTTS, AISHELL3) using four Tesla V100-SXM2-32G GPUs with batch size 48, and evaluated using WER/CER, NISQA-V2, SECS, and MOS metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieved MOS scores comparable to ANN baselines (3.94±0.08 vs 3.98±0.05 on LJSpeech)
- Consumed only 10.5% of the energy compared to ANN models
- Demonstrated significant energy efficiency with average firing rates of 19.5%
- Successfully handled both English and Chinese datasets with single and multi-speaker configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: STSA enables SpikeVoice to capture global temporal dependencies by performing temporal-mixing before sequential-mixing, overcoming the serial nature of spiking neurons.
- Mechanism: The Spiking Temporal Attention component of STSA performs binary embedding on spiking neuron outputs across all time steps, allowing access to future time-step information. This temporal-mixing aggregates global information at each spiking time step before the Sequential Attention component integrates contextual information along the sequence dimension.
- Core assumption: The serial charge-fire-reset dynamics of LIF neurons prevent information from future time steps from being available during sequential processing, necessitating explicit temporal-mixing to capture long-term dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The serial nature of spiking neurons, however, leads to the invisibility of information at future spiking time steps, limiting SNN models to capture sequence dependencies solely within the same time step."
  - [section] "Due to the serial nature of LIF neurons, it results in the inability to capture information from future time steps along the spiking temporal dimension and leads to the issue of 'partial-time dependency'. Therefore, we propose the Spiking Temporal Attention to perform temporal-mixing over the spiking temporal dimension obtaining the global information of binary embedding."
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus contains related SNN papers but none specifically addressing temporal-mixing in attention mechanisms for TTS.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Spike-driven processing with LIF neurons provides 10.5% energy consumption of ANN while maintaining comparable speech quality through sparse binary communication.
- Mechanism: LIF neurons implement charge-fire-reset dynamics where membrane potential accumulates input current, fires a binary spike when threshold is reached, then resets. This event-driven mechanism activates only when significant input occurs, creating sparse firing patterns. The spike-driven paradigm replaces energy-intensive MAC operations with sparse additive operations in attention mechanisms.
- Core assumption: Binary spike communication between neurons requires significantly less energy than continuous-valued communication, and the event-driven nature ensures computation only occurs during spike events.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SpikeVoice achieves TTS performance close to artificial neural networks (ANNs) while consuming only 10.5% of the energy"
  - [section] "Furthermore, we implement SpikeVoice in a spike-driven manner with the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, fully harnessing the energy efficiency of SNN. Spike-driven denotes the concurrent existence of both the binary spike communication feature and the event-driven feature."
  - [corpus] Weak - While the corpus contains SNN papers, none provide specific energy consumption comparisons for TTS applications.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: STSA resolves the "partial-time dependency" issue by performing temporal-mixing to access global information across time steps before sequential-mixing.
- Mechanism: The two-stage mixing process first aggregates information temporally (across time steps at each position) to capture global context, then aggregates sequentially (across positions at each time step) to integrate local context. This resolves the limitation where spiking neurons can only access information within the same time step due to their serial nature.
- Core assumption: The "partial-time dependency" problem is fundamental to SNNs due to their temporal dynamics, and requires explicit architectural solutions rather than standard attention mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We term this phenomenon 'partial-time dependency'. To address this issue, we introduce Spiking Temporal-Sequential Attention (STSA) in the SpikeVoice."
  - [section] "The serial nature of spiking neurons, however, leads to the invisibility of information at future spiking time steps, limiting SNN models to capture sequence dependencies solely within the same time step. We term this phenomenon 'partial-time dependency'. To address this issue, we propose Spiking Temporal-Sequential Attention (STSA) in SpikeV oice."
  - [corpus] Missing - The corpus does not contain papers specifically discussing "partial-time dependency" in SNNs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LIF neurons work is essential for implementing SpikeVoice, as the entire model relies on spike-driven processing with these neurons.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the membrane potential of an LIF neuron after it fires a spike?

- Concept: Temporal and sequential attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: STSA combines both temporal and sequential attention, so understanding standard attention mechanisms is crucial for grasping how STSA extends them for SNNs.
  - Quick check question: How does standard multi-head attention differ from the temporal-mixing approach in STSA?

- Concept: Binary embedding and spike communication
  - Why needed here: SpikeVoice operates on binary spike tensors rather than continuous values, so understanding binary embedding is key to implementing and debugging the model.
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when converting continuous embeddings to binary spike representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input phoneme sequence → Spiking Phoneme Encoder (STSA + spiking feedforward) → Spiking Variance Adaptor (variance prediction + length regulation) → Spiking Mel Decoder (STSA + spiking feedforward) → Spiking PostNet → Output Mel-spectrogram
- Critical path: The data flows through phoneme encoding, variance adaptation for duration/pitch/energy, mel-spectrogram generation, and post-processing refinement.
- Design tradeoffs: SpikeVoice trades some information density for energy efficiency through binary spike communication. The temporal-mixing in STSA adds computational overhead but is necessary to overcome SNN limitations. The choice of LIF neurons provides biological plausibility but slower training compared to standard ANNs.
- Failure signatures: High spike firing rates (>50%) indicate loss of energy efficiency; poor Mel-spectrogram quality at sequence tails suggests temporal dependency issues; degraded speaker similarity in multi-speaker settings indicates information loss in variance adaptation.
- First 3 experiments: 1) Verify LIF neuron implementation by checking membrane potential dynamics and spike generation. 2) Test STSA module independently by comparing outputs with and without temporal-mixing. 3) Validate energy consumption estimates by measuring actual power usage during inference with different time steps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the performance gap between SpikeVoice and ANN-based models in multi-speaker synthesis be minimized while maintaining energy efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that in multi-speaker datasets, the sparse nature of spike tensors leads to information loss, resulting in a performance gap between SNN-based and ANN-based models.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not propose specific solutions to minimize the performance gap without sacrificing energy efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating improved performance on multi-speaker datasets through novel techniques that reduce information loss in spike tensors while maintaining low energy consumption would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies to reduce information loss during the binary embedding process in SNNs while maintaining low firing rates in deep neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of binary embedding in SNNs, leading to information loss and performance degradation. It also mentions the potential for further reducing energy consumption by lowering firing rates in deep neural networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies these as areas for future research but does not provide specific strategies or techniques to address these challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating novel methods to preserve information during binary embedding while achieving low firing rates in deep SNN architectures would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can spike neurons be effectively parallelized to improve the training speed of SpikeVoice without compromising its energy efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the sequential mechanism of LIF neurons results in slower training speed compared to ANNs, and suggests parallelization of spike neurons as a potential solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a limitation but does not explore specific parallelization techniques or their impact on training speed and energy efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the training speed and energy consumption of SpikeVoice with and without parallelization techniques would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The paper introduces "partial-time dependency" as a novel concept without validation from existing SNN literature
- Energy efficiency claims lack experimental validation with actual power measurements
- Multi-speaker performance shows a gap compared to ANN models due to information loss in sparse spike tensors
- Training speed is slower than ANNs due to the sequential nature of LIF neurons

## Confidence
- TTS performance claims: Medium - MOS scores reported but limited statistical detail
- Energy efficiency claims: Low - No methodology provided for measuring actual power consumption
- Novel mechanism claims: Medium-Low - "Partial-time dependency" concept lacks corpus support
- Multi-speaker performance: Medium - Acknowledged limitations but no solutions proposed

## Next Checks
1. Measure actual power consumption during SpikeVoice inference across different time steps to verify the 10.5% energy efficiency claim.
2. Compare SpikeVoice performance against established non-SNN TTS baselines like Tacotron2 and FastSpeech2 on the same datasets to establish relative performance.
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the temporal-mixing component of STSA to empirically demonstrate the "partial-time dependency" issue and its resolution.
