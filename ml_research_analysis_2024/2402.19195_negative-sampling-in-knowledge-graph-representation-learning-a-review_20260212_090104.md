- This survey comprehensively reviews 64 negative sampling methods in Knowledge Graph Representation Learning, categorizing them into six groups and identifying key research directions.

## Executive Summary
This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of negative sampling (NS) methods in Knowledge Graph Representation Learning (KGRL), systematically categorizing 64 studies into six groups: Static, Dynamic, Adversarial, Self-Adversarial, Mix-up, and Text-based NS. The paper addresses the critical challenge of generating high-quality negative samples to improve KGRL model performance, particularly in incomplete knowledge graphs. It highlights how NS transforms training from computationally intractable full-graph comparison to tractable binary classification through Noise Contrastive Estimation. The survey identifies open research directions including mitigating false negatives, mix-up negative strategies, text-based sampling, and non-sampling approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper systematically reviews negative sampling literature in KGRL through comprehensive literature analysis. The authors categorize 64 studies into six methodological groups based on their sampling strategies and implementation approaches. They analyze each category's characteristics, advantages, and limitations while providing detailed taxonomies. The review covers fundamental concepts like Noise Contrastive Estimation, closed-world vs open-world assumptions, and various embedding space geometries. The authors evaluate each method's effectiveness through link prediction tasks and computational efficiency considerations.

## Key Results
- Negative sampling transforms KGRL training from intractable full-graph comparison to tractable binary classification through Noise Contrastive Estimation
- Dynamic and self-adversarial methods produce more semantically meaningful negatives but with higher computational costs
- The closed-world assumption underlying most NS methods becomes problematic as knowledge graphs become more incomplete
- Mix-up and text-based NS methods show promise but require further comprehensive evaluation across domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Negative sampling transforms KGRL training from computationally intractable full-graph comparison into tractable binary classification
- Mechanism: The model samples a small subset of negatives instead of evaluating all possible incorrect triples, optimizing a binary classification objective that distinguishes between observed (positive) and unobserved (negative) triples through Noise Contrastive Estimation
- Core assumption: Knowledge graphs are incomplete, so many unobserved triples are actually false (closed-world assumption), making them valid training negatives
- Evidence anchors: The abstract states that generating negative instances becomes essential since knowledge bases predominantly consist of positive instances. NCE was developed to overcome computational difficulties of probabilistic models by transforming density estimation into binary classification.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamic negative sampling methods generate more informative training samples by adapting to the evolving embedding space during training
- Mechanism: Dynamic methods generate negatives on-the-fly based on the current state of the model's embeddings, allowing the model to encounter increasingly challenging negatives as it learns
- Core assumption: The embedding space evolves meaningfully during training, and the model's current understanding can guide selection of informative negative samples
- Evidence anchors: Dynamic NS methods generate negative samples during training, adapting selection as the model's embeddings change to ensure the model encounters increasingly challenging negatives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mix-up negative sampling creates more challenging training samples by interpolating between hard negative triples
- Mechanism: Mix-up methods combine multiple negative samples through linear interpolation to create synthetic negatives that are even more difficult to distinguish from positive triples
- Core assumption: The embedding space supports meaningful interpolation between negative samples, and resulting mixed samples preserve semantic properties needed for effective training
- Evidence anchors: Mix-up NS combines data augmentation with negative sampling to create synthetic negatives by interpolating between hard negative triplets, leading to more difficult samples for the model to learn from.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and its application to knowledge graph embedding
  - Why needed here: Understanding NCE is fundamental to grasping why negative sampling works and how it transforms the training problem from intractable to tractable
  - Quick check question: How does NCE transform a density estimation problem into a binary classification problem, and why is this transformation beneficial for knowledge graph embedding?

- Concept: Closed-world assumption vs. open-world assumption in knowledge graphs
  - Why needed here: These assumptions determine which unobserved triples are treated as negative samples and affect the validity of negative sampling approaches
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between closed-world and open-world assumptions, and how do they impact the generation of negative samples in knowledge graph embedding?

- Concept: Embedding space geometry and distance metrics in knowledge graph models
  - Why needed here: Different knowledge graph embedding models use different geometric spaces (Euclidean, complex, hyperbolic) which affect how negative samples are generated and evaluated
  - Quick check question: How do different geometric representations (e.g., TransE's translation, RotatE's rotation) affect the selection and evaluation of negative samples in knowledge graph embedding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Positive sample selection from knowledge graph -> Negative sample generation based on chosen sampling strategy -> Model training with loss function distinguishing positives from negatives -> Periodic evaluation of embedding quality on link prediction tasks
- Critical path: For a new engineer, the critical path is understanding how the chosen negative sampling method generates samples, how these samples are used in the loss function, and how sampling parameters affect model performance
- Design tradeoffs: Static sampling offers efficiency but poor adaptability; dynamic sampling provides better quality but higher computational cost; knowledge-constrained methods improve semantic relevance but require additional data sources
- Failure signatures: Common failures include vanishing gradients (too easy negatives), mode collapse in adversarial methods, false negatives degrading performance, and sampling bias that over-represents frequent entities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement uniform negative sampling and measure training time vs. model performance on a small knowledge graph
  2. Compare static vs. dynamic negative sampling on link prediction accuracy while measuring computational overhead
  3. Evaluate the impact of false negatives by artificially introducing known true triples as negatives and measuring performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open research directions including mitigating false negatives in highly incomplete knowledge graphs, developing more effective mix-up negative strategies, exploring text-based sampling approaches, and investigating non-sampling alternatives for negative instance generation.

## Limitations
- The closed-world assumption underlying most NS methods becomes problematic as knowledge graphs become more incomplete, leading to potential false negatives
- Computational overhead of dynamic and self-adversarial methods may not be justified for smaller knowledge graphs or resource-constrained applications
- Evaluation metrics (typically link prediction accuracy) may not fully capture nuanced improvements that different NS methods provide for specific downstream tasks

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The effectiveness of negative sampling in transforming KGRL training from intractable full-graph comparison to tractable binary classification (supported by extensive theoretical and empirical evidence). **Medium Confidence**: The superiority of dynamic and self-adversarial methods over static approaches for producing semantically meaningful negatives (results vary significantly across datasets and model architectures). **Low Confidence**: The long-term viability of mix-up and text-based NS methods, as these are emerging approaches with limited comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge graph domains.

## Next Checks
1. **False Negative Impact Assessment**: Systematically measure how different rates of false negatives affect model performance across various NS methods to establish practical limits for NS applicability
2. **Computational Overhead vs. Performance Trade-off**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing static, dynamic, and self-adversarial methods on knowledge graphs of varying sizes and densities to quantify when performance gains justify additional computational costs
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Study**: Evaluate the same NS methods across multiple knowledge graph domains (biomedical, social, geographic) to identify which approaches are most robust to domain-specific semantic structures and entity distributions
