# Games of Knightian Uncertainty as AGI testbeds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.18178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18178
- Reference count: 25
- Proposes Knightian uncertainty games as new benchmark for AI adaptability testing

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that current game-based AI benchmarks fail to capture real-world adaptability challenges because they rely on stationary environments. The authors propose Knightian uncertainty games as a new testing framework where AI agents must adapt to abrupt, unpredictable changes in game rules without model access. This approach aims to push AI development beyond memorization toward genuine general intelligence by testing how well systems handle unknown unknowns and on-the-fly adaptation.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology involves training agents on a limited set of games, then testing their ability to generalize to variations (near OOD) and entirely different games (far OOD) without access to the underlying models. This setup forces AI systems to adapt dynamically to rule changes rather than relying on predefined strategies or memorization. The framework emphasizes testing adaptation capabilities in environments that reflect real-world unpredictability.

## Key Results
- Current game-based AI tests are insufficient for real-world adaptability assessment
- Agents trained on stationary environments struggle with unpredictable rule changes
- The proposed framework aims to distinguish between memorization-based and genuinely adaptive AI systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on creating environments that force AI systems to develop genuine adaptability rather than memorizing specific patterns. By introducing Knightian uncertainty - where probabilities cannot be known in advance - the framework pushes agents to develop robust decision-making capabilities that work across unknown scenarios. This mirrors real-world situations where rules and conditions change unpredictably.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knightian uncertainty**: Why needed - forms the theoretical basis for testing adaptation to unknown scenarios; Quick check - can the agent handle situations where probability distributions are unknowable?
- **Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization**: Why needed - measures ability to adapt to new, unseen environments; Quick check - does performance degrade significantly on near versus far OOD tasks?
- **Model-free adaptation**: Why needed - tests ability to adapt without relying on predefined models; Quick check - can the agent adjust strategies when given no model access?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Training games -> Agent development -> Near OOD testing -> Far OOD testing -> Adaptation assessment

Critical path: The core workflow involves agent training on base games, followed by systematic testing on progressively more distant OOD scenarios to measure adaptation capabilities.

Design tradeoffs: Balancing game complexity with testability, ensuring rule changes are meaningful but not impossible, and creating sufficient variety in testing scenarios while maintaining scientific rigor.

Failure signatures: Agents that rely heavily on memorization will show sharp performance drops when faced with rule changes, while truly adaptive systems should demonstrate more graceful degradation or recovery.

First experiments:
1. Compare performance of standard RL agents versus meta-learning agents on rule-change scenarios
2. Test adaptation speed when rules change mid-game versus between games
3. Measure performance differences between agents trained on single games versus diverse game sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but implies several areas for investigation including the development of quantitative metrics for adaptation quality and the empirical validation of the proposed framework's effectiveness.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation provided for the proposed benchmark setup
- Lacks concrete metrics for measuring adaptation quality or success rates
- Uncertainty about whether artificial rule changes truly capture real-world unpredictability

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core argument that current game-based AI tests are insufficient for testing real-world adaptability
- Medium confidence: The theoretical framework of using Knightian uncertainty as a benchmark concept
- Low confidence: The practical implementation details and effectiveness of the proposed testing methodology

## Next Checks
1. Implement pilot experiments comparing agent performance on standard stationary games versus Knightian uncertainty games to measure actual adaptation capabilities
2. Develop quantitative metrics for evaluating "near OOD" versus "far OOD" generalization success rates
3. Test the framework with multiple AI architectures to determine if it consistently identifies more adaptable systems across different approaches
