core_contribution: X-Prompt is a pure auto-regressive vision-language model that achieves
  universal in-context image generation across seen and unseen tasks. The key innovation
  is a context compression mechanism that distills valuable features from in-context
  examples into fixed-length tokens, enabling longer context handling and improved
  generalization.
