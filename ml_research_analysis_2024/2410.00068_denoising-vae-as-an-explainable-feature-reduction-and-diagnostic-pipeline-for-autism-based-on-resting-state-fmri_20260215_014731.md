# Denoising VAE as an Explainable Feature Reduction and Diagnostic Pipeline for Autism Based on Resting state fMRI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.00068
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00068
- Reference count: 40
- 95% confidence interval for SVM prediction accuracy: [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of objective diagnostic biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using resting-state fMRI data. The authors propose a feature reduction pipeline using a denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) to compress high-dimensional functional connectivity data into low-dimensional latent Gaussian distributions. The DVAE successfully encodes diagnostic information from rs-fMRI data into 5 latent Gaussian distributions without sacrificing prediction performance, reducing computational time by 7 times compared to training classifiers directly on raw data. The study also demonstrates that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than the Craddock atlas.

## Method Summary
The pipeline begins with preprocessing rs-fMRI data from the IMPAC dataset (1,029 subjects after quality control) using Power atlas (264 ROIs) and Ncuts parcellations (249 ROIs) to extract functional connectivity matrices. Site harmonization is performed using the ComBat algorithm to remove batch effects. A denoising VAE with 5 latent Gaussian distributions compresses the 34,980-dimensional input vectors into 10 features by injecting Gaussian noise (variance 0.1) during training. These compressed features are then used as input to SVM and Random Forest classifiers with hyperparameter tuning. The model is validated using 5-fold cross-validation with 80% training/validation and 20% test split, achieving prediction accuracy with 95% CI [0.63, 0.76] for SVM after site harmonization.

## Key Results
- DVAE reduced dimensionality from 34,980 to 10 features without sacrificing classification performance
- Power atlas parcellation yielded better classification performance than Craddock atlas for ASD diagnosis
- Site harmonization using ComBat algorithm improved cross-site generalization of the model
- Computational time reduced by 7x compared to training classifiers directly on raw data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The denoising VAE reduces dimensionality from over 30,000 to 10 features without losing classification performance. By forcing the encoder to reconstruct the input from a small latent space while regularizing with KL divergence, the model learns a compressed representation that preserves the most discriminative information for ASD vs. control. Core assumption: The diagnostic signal in rs-fMRI functional connectivity can be captured in a low-dimensional latent space without significant information loss. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The DVAE successfully encoded the diagnostic information from rs-fMRI data into 5 latent Gaussian distributions without sacrificing prediction performance."

### Mechanism 2
Using Power atlas parcellation yields better classification performance than Craddock atlas. The Power atlas defines 264 functionally homogeneous regions based on correlated activity patterns, which may capture more relevant neural circuits for ASD than the 249-region Craddock atlas derived from different criteria. Core assumption: The choice of functional parcellation scheme affects the quality of connectivity features for disease classification. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our findings also suggest that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than Ncuts parcellations."

### Mechanism 3
Site harmonization using ComBat algorithm improves cross-site generalization of the model. ComBat removes site-specific batch effects from the correlation features while preserving biological variation, allowing the classifier to learn patterns that generalize across acquisition sites. Core assumption: Site-specific technical variations are confounding factors that can be statistically removed without losing diagnostic signal. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The 95% confidence interval for the prediction accuracy of SVM is [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization using the extracted latent distributions."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders and Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VAEs balance reconstruction accuracy with latent space regularization through the ELBO loss function is crucial for tuning the model's compression-performance tradeoff.
  - Quick check question: What are the two terms in the ELBO loss function, and how do they influence the learned latent representation?

- Concept: Functional connectivity matrices and parcellation atlases
  - Why needed here: The quality of the input features depends on how brain regions are defined and how their correlations are computed; understanding different atlas choices is essential for feature engineering.
  - Quick check question: How does the Power atlas differ from anatomical atlases in defining brain regions, and why might this matter for functional connectivity analysis?

- Concept: Cross-validation and permutation testing for model validation
  - Why needed here: Proper validation is critical when working with small sample sizes and high-dimensional data to ensure the model generalizes and results aren't due to chance.
  - Quick check question: Why is leave-one-site-out cross-validation particularly important for this multi-site ASD dataset, and what does it tell us about model generalizability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: fMRI preprocessing -> Power atlas connectivity extraction (264 ROIs) -> ComBat harmonization -> DVAE reduction (34,980 -> 10 features) -> SVM/Random Forest classification -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Connectivity extraction → ComBat harmonization → DVAE reduction → Classifier training → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latent dimension size (5 distributions / 10 features): Smaller size increases computational efficiency but risks losing discriminative information
  - Noise level in DVAE (0.1 variance): Higher noise increases robustness but may require longer training
  - Atlas choice: Power atlas may capture more relevant functional networks but has more features than Craddock atlas
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: Large gap between training and test performance
  - Underfitting: Poor performance on both training and test sets
  - Site-specific failure: Good cross-validation but poor leave-one-site-out performance
  - Dimensionality issues: DVAE reconstruction loss plateaus early, suggesting insufficient capacity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train DVAE with varying latent dimensions (3, 5, 7) and compare reconstruction loss and downstream classification performance
  2. Run the full pipeline with and without ComBat harmonization to quantify the impact on cross-site generalization
  3. Compare Power atlas vs. Craddock atlas connectivity features using identical DVAE and classifier settings to validate the atlas choice

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the specific brain networks represented by the 5 latent distributions in the DVAE model contribute to the classification of ASD versus neurotypical individuals? While the paper mentions the successful encoding and potential for visualization, it does not provide detailed information on which specific brain networks are represented by the 5 latent distributions or how they contribute to the classification. What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis and visualization of the 5 latent distributions, identifying the specific brain networks they represent and their relative contributions to the classification of ASD versus neurotypical individuals.

### Open Question 2
Does the DVAE model generalize well to other datasets or populations beyond the IMPAC dataset used in this study? The paper mentions that the DVAE model achieved good performance on the IMPAC dataset, but does not explicitly test its generalizability to other datasets or populations. It only mentions leave-one-site-out cross-validation within the IMPAC dataset. What evidence would resolve it: Testing the DVAE model on other independent datasets with different characteristics, such as age ranges, geographical locations, or data collection methods, and comparing its performance to that on the IMPAC dataset.

### Open Question 3
How do the latent features extracted by the DVAE model compare to other dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or t-SNE, in terms of classification performance and interpretability for ASD diagnosis? The paper focuses on the DVAE model for dimensionality reduction but does not compare its performance to other techniques. It mentions that the DVAE model provides a low-dimensional representation of the data, but does not discuss how it compares to other methods in terms of classification accuracy or interpretability. What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study using the same dataset and classification task, applying different dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) and comparing their performance in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability of the extracted features.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks specific architectural details for the DVAE implementation, including layer configurations and activation functions, which could affect reproducibility
- The claim of "explainable" features is not fully substantiated - while the latent distributions can be mapped back to brain regions, the interpretability of these 5 dimensions is not demonstrated
- The sample size (1,029 subjects) represents a moderate cohort for neuroimaging studies, and the 95% confidence interval [0.63, 0.76] for accuracy indicates substantial uncertainty in the classifier's performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The dimensionality reduction from 34,980 to 10 features without performance loss is well-supported by the reported metrics and follows established VAE principles
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority of Power atlas over Craddock atlas is demonstrated but lacks direct corpus validation and could be dataset-specific
- **Low confidence**: The "explainable" nature of the DVAE features is claimed but not empirically validated through interpretability analysis or clinical correlation

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies by removing individual latent dimensions and measuring impact on classification to identify which features contribute most to ASD discrimination
2. Test the trained model on an independent ASD dataset to validate whether the DVAE features generalize beyond the IMPAC cohort
3. Map the top-weighted latent features back to brain regions and assess whether they align with known ASD neuroanatomical findings to validate the biological plausibility of the learned representations
