core_contribution: This scoping review analyzed 432 papers on multimodal AI in medicine,
  finding that multimodal models consistently outperformed unimodal models by 6.2
  percentage points in AUC. The review identified that while multimodal AI development
  is growing rapidly, particularly in integrating radiology and text data, significant
  challenges remain in cross-departmental coordination, handling heterogeneous data
  characteristics, and managing incomplete datasets.

# Navigating the landscape of multimodal AI in medicine: a scoping review on technical challenges and clinical applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.03782
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03782
- Reference count: 40
- Multimodal models outperformed unimodal models by 6.2 percentage points in AUC

## Executive Summary
This scoping review analyzed 432 papers on multimodal AI in medicine, revealing consistent performance superiority of multimodal approaches over unimodal models. The review found multimodal models achieved a 6.2 percentage point improvement in AUC compared to unimodal approaches. While research activity is rapidly growing, particularly in radiology-text integration, significant implementation barriers persist including cross-departmental coordination challenges, heterogeneous data handling difficulties, and incomplete dataset management. Despite these obstacles, multimodal AI shows substantial promise for enhancing clinical decision-making, though no FDA- or CE-certified models currently exist for clinical use.

## Method Summary
The scoping review followed PRISMA guidelines to systematically search databases including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and arXiv. From an initial 13,382 records, 432 papers were included after screening and eligibility assessment. Data extraction focused on technical characteristics, data modalities, clinical applications, and challenges. The review excluded FDA- or CE-certified models from clinical practice analysis but included them for technical examination.

## Key Results
- Multimodal models achieved 6.2 percentage points higher AUC than unimodal models
- Research activity has increased substantially, particularly in radiology-text integration
- No FDA- or CE-certified multimodal AI models are currently available for clinical use
- Major challenges include cross-departmental coordination, heterogeneous data characteristics, and incomplete datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Multimodal AI works in medicine by integrating diverse data types (images, text, signals, genomics) that capture different aspects of patient health. The complementary nature of these modalities allows models to leverage correlations between different data sources, reducing uncertainty and improving diagnostic accuracy. For example, combining radiology images with clinical notes enables the model to understand both visual findings and contextual patient information, leading to more comprehensive assessments than either modality alone.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal data integration: Combining different data types (images, text, signals) to capture comprehensive patient information - needed because single modalities miss critical clinical context
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms: Techniques that enable models to focus on relevant features across different modalities - needed to identify meaningful relationships between heterogeneous data
- Data harmonization: Standardizing diverse data formats and characteristics - needed because medical data varies in structure, scale, and quality across departments
- Incomplete data handling: Strategies for managing missing or partially available multimodal datasets - needed since real-world medical data often lacks complete modality coverage
- Clinical workflow integration: Incorporating AI tools into existing medical processes - needed to ensure practical adoption and minimize disruption to clinical practice

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Ingestion -> Preprocessing -> Multimodal Fusion -> Clinical Prediction -> Validation
Critical path: Raw medical data → Feature extraction → Cross-modal attention → Decision fusion → Clinical output
Design tradeoffs: Performance vs. interpretability, complexity vs. generalizability, data requirements vs. practical feasibility
Failure signatures: Performance degradation with missing modalities, attention collapse to dominant modality, overfitting to specific institutional data
First experiments: 1) Unimodal baseline comparison on same dataset, 2) Ablation study removing individual modalities, 3) Cross-institutional validation testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Excluded FDA- or CE-certified models from clinical practice analysis, limiting real-world applicability
- Focus on published literature may overrepresent positive results and underrepresent implementation challenges
- Heterogeneous study methodologies limit generalizability of specific performance improvements

## Confidence
- Multimodal AI performance superiority: High confidence
- Rapid growth in multimodal AI research: High confidence
- Significant implementation challenges: Medium confidence
- No FDA-CE certified multimodal models available: High confidence
- Substantial performance gains potential: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic evaluation of FDA- and CE-certified AI models to verify the absence of multimodal approaches in clinical deployment and identify barriers to regulatory approval
2. Perform meta-analysis on the 432 papers with quality assessment to determine publication bias and verify the consistency of the 6.2% AUC improvement across different clinical applications
3. Execute case studies at hospitals with successful multimodal AI implementations to document actual cross-departmental coordination challenges and data integration workflows not captured in published literature
