# DetoxBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multitask Fraud & Abuse Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.06072
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06072
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive benchmark suite evaluating LLMs across eight fraud and abuse detection tasks, revealing task-specific performance variations and the limited impact of few-shot prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DetoxBench, a novel benchmark suite designed to systematically evaluate large language models (LLMs) for fraud and abuse detection across diverse tasks. The benchmark includes eight carefully selected datasets covering spam email detection, hate speech identification, and misogynistic language classification, among others. Eight state-of-the-art LLMs from various providers were evaluated using both zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies to establish baseline performance and identify areas for improvement in fraud detection capabilities.

The evaluation reveals that while LLMs demonstrate competent baseline performance in individual fraud and abuse detection tasks, their effectiveness varies considerably across different types of harmful content. Models from Mistral and Anthropic families generally achieved the highest F1 scores, particularly excelling in tasks requiring nuanced understanding of language and context. Notably, the study found that few-shot prompting does not always significantly improve performance over zero-shot prompting, suggesting that these models possess inherent capabilities for certain fraud detection tasks without extensive task-specific examples.

## Method Summary
The DetoxBench framework employs a systematic evaluation methodology where multiple LLMs are tested across eight diverse fraud and abuse detection datasets. Each model undergoes both zero-shot and few-shot prompting evaluations, with performance measured using standard classification metrics including F1 scores. The datasets were carefully curated to represent different types of fraudulent and abusive content, ensuring comprehensive coverage of real-world scenarios. The evaluation pipeline includes preprocessing steps, prompt engineering, and standardized scoring mechanisms to ensure fair comparison across different model families and sizes.

## Key Results
- LLMs show proficient baseline performance in individual fraud and abuse detection tasks, with F1 scores varying significantly across different datasets
- Models from Mistral and Anthropic families achieved the highest overall performance, particularly excelling in tasks requiring nuanced language understanding
- Few-shot prompting strategies did not consistently improve performance over zero-shot approaches, indicating inherent model capabilities for certain detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive multi-dataset approach and systematic evaluation methodology. By testing models across diverse fraud and abuse scenarios, the framework captures the complexity and variability inherent in real-world detection tasks. The combination of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies reveals the models' inherent capabilities versus their ability to adapt to specific task requirements. The standardized evaluation protocol ensures fair comparison across different model architectures and sizes.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Fraud Detection Task Diversity** (why needed: different fraud types require different detection strategies; quick check: verify dataset coverage spans multiple fraud categories)
2. **LLM Prompting Strategies** (why needed: zero-shot vs few-shot impacts model performance; quick check: compare performance gaps across prompting methods)
3. **Evaluation Metrics Selection** (why needed: F1 scores capture precision-recall balance; quick check: ensure metrics align with detection task requirements)
4. **Model Architecture Differences** (why needed: different model families have varying strengths; quick check: analyze performance patterns by model family)
5. **Dataset Preprocessing** (why needed: consistent preprocessing ensures fair comparisons; quick check: verify preprocessing pipelines are standardized)
6. **Cross-Validation Methodology** (why needed: prevents overfitting to specific datasets; quick check: confirm proper train/test splits are maintained)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Dataset Preprocessing -> Model Evaluation -> Performance Analysis -> Benchmark Reporting

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline follows a linear flow where datasets are first collected and preprocessed, then models are evaluated using standardized prompts, with results analyzed and compiled into the final benchmark report.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive task coverage over deep specialization in any single detection type, trading depth for breadth to provide a more generalizable evaluation framework.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation typically occurs when models encounter tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge not present in pretraining data, or when prompt engineering fails to properly frame the detection task.

**First Experiments**:
1. Establish baseline F1 scores for each model across all eight datasets using zero-shot prompting
2. Compare performance variations between Mistral and Anthropic model families on hate speech detection tasks
3. Evaluate the impact of increasing few-shot examples from 1 to 5 on spam email detection accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark scope limited by selection of eight datasets, potentially missing some real-world fraud and abuse scenarios
- Lack of statistical significance testing for performance differences between zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies
- Evaluation metrics focus primarily on F1 scores without comprehensive assessment of computational efficiency or precision-recall trade-offs

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Task-specific performance variations are well-supported | High |
| Few-shot prompting does not consistently improve performance | High |
| Benchmark provides systematic evaluation framework | Medium |
| Need for further development is well-established | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical significance testing on performance differences between zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies across all datasets to confirm non-significant improvements
2. Evaluate models on additional datasets representing underrepresented fraud and abuse scenarios, such as deepfake detection or coordinated inauthentic behavior
3. Implement cross-dataset validation by training models on one dataset and testing on others to assess generalization capabilities and potential data leakage issues
