# Improving deep learning with prior knowledge and cognitive models: A survey on enhancing explainability, adversarial robustness and zero-shot learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.07078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07078
- Reference count: 40
- This survey explores how integrating prior knowledge and cognitive principles can address critical limitations in deep learning, including adversarial robustness, interpretability, and zero-shot generalization.

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive survey examines how incorporating prior knowledge and cognitive principles can overcome fundamental limitations in deep learning. The authors categorize knowledge representations (mathematical equations, knowledge graphs, logic rules, probabilistic relationships, and pre-trained foundation models) and brain-inspired techniques (cognitive architectures and neural networks). They demonstrate how knowledge-driven methods enhance adversarial defenses through logical reasoning and compositional structures, while brain-inspired approaches improve data efficiency by aligning with biological principles. The review particularly highlights pre-trained multimodal models like CLIP for zero-shot brain decoding tasks, showing strong performance across diverse applications.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys existing approaches that integrate prior knowledge and cognitive principles into deep learning frameworks. Methods include knowledge-driven approaches using logical reasoning, compositional part-based structures, and knowledge graphs for adversarial defenses and interpretability, brain-inspired techniques incorporating predictive coding and neurobiologically plausible architectures for improved data efficiency and robustness, and leveraging pre-trained multimodal models like CLIP for zero-shot generalization. The review synthesizes findings across multiple application domains while identifying open challenges and future research directions.

## Key Results
- Knowledge-driven approaches using logical reasoning and co-occurrence constraints can detect adversarial examples by identifying contextually implausible predictions
- Brain-inspired architectures incorporating V1 simulation and predictive coding demonstrate improved robustness to both adversarial and natural perturbations
- Pre-trained foundation models like CLIP achieve strong zero-shot performance in brain decoding tasks by leveraging implicit world knowledge from massive datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge-driven approaches improve adversarial robustness by enabling logical consistency checks that detect implausible predictions.
- Mechanism: Domain knowledge encoded as logical rules, co-occurrence constraints, or part-based reasoning is used to verify whether model outputs align with real-world expectations. When a prediction violates these constraints, it is flagged as potentially adversarial.
- Core assumption: Adversarial examples often create outputs that are contextually inconsistent with domain knowledge, while legitimate predictions should conform to known relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Knowledge-driven methods leverage logical reasoning, compositional part-based structures, and knowledge graphs to enhance adversarial defenses"
  - [section 3.1] "Using co-occurrence logic (e.g., [104]), it is easy to detect the inconsistency of a bus and a toothbrush co-existing in a scene"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If attackers can craft adversarial examples that satisfy all domain knowledge constraints, or if the knowledge representation itself is compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Brain-inspired techniques improve data efficiency and robustness by aligning neural network architectures and training with biological principles.
- Mechanism: Incorporating neuroanatomical constraints (VOneNet), predictive coding, or task-aligned training transfers robustness and generalization properties from biological systems to artificial networks.
- Core assumption: The brain's organizational principles and learning mechanisms evolved to handle noise, adversarial conditions, and few-shot learning effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Brain-inspired approaches, including predictive coding and neurobiologically plausible architectures, improve data efficiency and robustness"
  - [section 4.1.2] "VOneNet incorporates a model of the primate V1... demonstrates high level of immunity against a wide range of adversarial and common perturbations"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention brain-inspired approaches but don't directly support this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If biological plausibility introduces computational constraints that outweigh benefits, or if simplified biological models fail to capture relevant properties.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-trained foundation models provide zero-shot and few-shot generalization by encoding implicit world knowledge from massive datasets.
- Mechanism: Large-scale multimodal models trained on diverse web data acquire rich semantic representations that enable reasoning about unseen concepts through similarity and analogy.
- Core assumption: The implicit knowledge captured during pre-training includes sufficient information about real-world relationships to enable generalization beyond training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Pre-trained multimodal models, particularly CLIP, demonstrate strong performance in zero-shot brain decoding tasks"
  - [section 3.3] "Pre-trained foundation models... have shown incredible abilities to generalize to new tasks and data distributions"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers discuss foundation models but don't specifically support this zero-shot mechanism
- Break condition: If the implicit knowledge is biased, incomplete, or not aligned with the target task domain.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge representation forms (mathematical equations, knowledge graphs, logic rules, probabilistic relationships)
  - Why needed here: Different forms of knowledge serve different purposes - logical rules for consistency checking, knowledge graphs for relationship encoding, mathematical equations for constraint satisfaction
  - Quick check question: Can you explain when you would use logic rules versus knowledge graphs for a given problem?

- Concept: Biological plausibility in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding how brain-inspired modifications (V1 simulation, predictive coding, multi-sensory integration) translate to improved robustness and data efficiency
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between backpropagation and predictive coding at the neuron level?

- Concept: Zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms
  - Why needed here: Recognizing when generalization beyond training data is required and which approaches (foundation models, compositional reasoning, knowledge graphs) are appropriate
  - Quick check question: How does zero-shot learning differ from few-shot learning in terms of the underlying challenge?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Knowledge encoders (for logical rules, knowledge graphs) -> Brain-inspired modules (V1 simulation, predictive coding layers) -> Multimodal fusion systems -> Foundation models (as pre-trained knowledge sources)
- Critical path: For adversarial robustness - knowledge encoding → consistency checking → output filtering. For generalization - foundation model integration → semantic alignment → inference.
- Design tradeoffs: Knowledge-informed methods offer interpretability and robustness but may sacrifice some accuracy. Brain-inspired approaches improve generalization but increase computational complexity. Foundation models provide strong generalization but raise privacy/ethical concerns.
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent predictions despite knowledge constraints suggest knowledge representation issues. Degraded performance after brain-inspired modifications indicates poor biological alignment. Foundation model failures suggest domain mismatch or bias.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement co-occurrence logic checking on a standard adversarial attack benchmark to measure detection rate.
  2. Add V1 simulation layer to a CNN and test robustness to common corruptions versus standard adversarial training.
  3. Fine-tune CLIP on fMRI data for brain decoding and compare zero-shot performance against unimodal approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the fundamental limitations preventing brain-inspired neural networks from matching human-level adversarial robustness despite their neuroanatomical alignment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that despite architectural enhancements mimicking V1 cortex and task-aligned training, current brain-inspired DNNs still underperform human perception in adversarial robustness, with the gap attributed to incomplete biological realism and incomplete domain knowledge.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the complexity of the brain and incomplete understanding of neural mechanisms, but does not specify which particular brain features or mechanisms are most critical for robustness that current models are missing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies comparing different neuroanatomical features (e.g., varying levels of cortical inhibition, feedback connections, plasticity mechanisms) to identify which specific components most significantly impact adversarial robustness when added to DNNs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between explicit knowledge representation (like logic rules and knowledge graphs) and implicit knowledge from foundation models for zero-shot learning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows both approaches achieve impressive zero-shot results, but raises concerns about the interpretability and ethical issues of large foundation models versus the domain-specificity limitations of explicit knowledge representations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of both approaches individually, it does not investigate hybrid architectures that optimally combine explicit and implicit knowledge or determine which types of tasks benefit most from each approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency across various zero-shot tasks using different combinations of explicit knowledge representations with foundation models, identifying optimal architectures for different task categories.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can cognitive architectures be designed to explicitly optimize for adversarial robustness, explainability, and zero-shot learning rather than achieving these capabilities implicitly through general intelligence?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that cognitive architectures achieve these objectives implicitly through their general intelligence goals, making it difficult to evaluate their effectiveness for specific objectives or compare different architectures systematically.
- Why unresolved: Current cognitive architectures prioritize general intelligence over specific capabilities, and the paper suggests this limits our ability to measure and improve their performance on individual objectives like adversarial robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of cognitive architectures with explicit optimization objectives for each capability, measuring performance improvements compared to current implicit approaches and identifying architectural features that most effectively target specific objectives.

## Limitations
- Fragmented literature where different knowledge representation forms are scattered across disparate domains, making systematic comparison difficult
- Evaluation of explainability and robustness improvements remains largely empirical without standardized benchmarks or theoretical guarantees
- Integration of prior knowledge often requires domain expertise that may not be available for all applications

## Confidence
- High confidence: Claims about knowledge-driven approaches improving adversarial robustness through logical consistency checks are well-supported by the cited mechanisms, though empirical validation varies.
- Medium confidence: Claims about brain-inspired techniques improving data efficiency and robustness are supported by specific examples like VOneNet, but broader generalization across domains requires further validation.
- Low confidence: Some claims about the superiority of hybrid symbolic-neural approaches over pure deep learning methods are presented without sufficient comparative data across multiple domains.

## Next Validation Checks
1. Implement co-occurrence logic checking on a standard adversarial attack benchmark (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to measure detection rate and false positive/negative ratios. Compare against traditional adversarial training methods.
2. Add V1 simulation layer to a standard CNN architecture and evaluate robustness to common corruptions (noise, blur, weather effects) versus standard adversarial training, using established robustness benchmarks.
3. Fine-tune CLIP on fMRI data for brain decoding tasks and compare zero-shot performance against unimodal approaches across multiple cognitive tasks, measuring both accuracy and interpretability metrics.
