# Human interaction classifier for LLM based chatbot

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21647
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21647
- Authors: Diego Martín; Jordi Sanchez; Xavier Vizcaíno
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: SVM and ANN models with Cohere embeddings achieve F1 scores of 0.99, 0.80, and 0.93 for Conversation, Services, and Document Translation tasks respectively, with execution times of 0.15-0.35 seconds

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of classification methods for human interactions in an AI-based chatbot environment. The research compares four approaches: LLM-based classifiers, KNN using Titan and Cohere embeddings, SVM, and artificial neural networks. The primary goal is to develop an efficient system for routing requests to appropriate specialized channels. The evaluation focuses on both accuracy and computational efficiency, revealing significant differences in performance across the tested methods.

The findings demonstrate that SVM and ANN models using Cohere embeddings achieve superior overall performance, particularly in terms of execution speed while maintaining high accuracy. The study concludes that the SVM model with Cohere embeddings represents the optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for classifying human interactions in the AIDA environment, making it the most suitable option for practical deployment.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four distinct classification approaches for human interaction classification in a chatbot environment. The methods compared include LLM-based classifiers, KNN using Titan and Cohere embeddings, SVM, and artificial neural networks. The evaluation framework assesses performance across three task categories: Conversation, Services, and Document Translation. The research measures both classification accuracy using F1 scores and computational efficiency through execution time metrics. The comparative analysis focuses on identifying the optimal balance between classification accuracy and processing speed for practical deployment in the AIDA chatbot environment.

## Key Results
- SVM and ANN models with Cohere embeddings achieve F1 scores of 0.99, 0.80, and 0.93 for Conversation, Services, and Document Translation tasks respectively
- Execution times for SVM and ANN models range from 0.15-0.35 seconds, significantly faster than LLM-based approaches (1.2-18 seconds)
- SVM model with Cohere embeddings is identified as the most suitable option, offering optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of SVM and ANN models with Cohere embeddings can be attributed to several factors. Cohere embeddings provide rich semantic representations that capture the nuances of human interactions effectively. The SVM algorithm excels at finding optimal decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces, making it particularly effective for classification tasks with complex feature representations. ANN models, when combined with Cohere embeddings, can learn hierarchical representations of the interaction data, allowing for sophisticated pattern recognition. The computational efficiency of these models compared to LLM-based approaches stems from their simpler inference mechanisms, which require fewer computational resources and can be optimized for real-time processing.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Why needed: SVM is effective for high-dimensional classification problems and can find optimal decision boundaries
   - Quick check: Verify margin maximization and kernel selection impact on classification performance

2. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
   - Why needed: ANNs can learn complex hierarchical representations of input data
   - Quick check: Assess network architecture impact on learning capacity and generalization

3. **Text Embeddings**
   - Why needed: Rich semantic representations are crucial for understanding human interactions
   - Quick check: Compare different embedding methods (Cohere vs Titan) for semantic quality

4. **Classification Metrics**
   - Why needed: F1 scores provide balanced measure of precision and recall
   - Quick check: Calculate additional metrics (precision, recall, confusion matrices) for comprehensive evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Input -> Embedding Generation -> Classification Model -> Output Routing

**Critical Path:** Raw text input → Cohere embedding generation → SVM/ANN classification → Task routing decision

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study prioritizes computational efficiency over the potentially higher accuracy of LLM-based approaches, accepting slightly lower performance for significantly faster execution times.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur with out-of-distribution inputs or when the embedding space doesn't capture task-specific nuances adequately.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare Cohere embeddings with alternative embedding methods on a held-out validation set
2. Test different SVM kernel functions to optimize decision boundary identification
3. Evaluate ANN architectures with varying depths and widths to find optimal structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed dataset characteristics including sample size, class balance, and preprocessing methods
- Evaluation metrics focus primarily on F1 scores and execution time without comprehensive analysis using other important metrics
- No discussion of potential bias in training data or generalizability to different chatbot environments

## Confidence
- High confidence: Comparative performance of different models (SVM and ANN with Cohere embeddings showing superior performance)
- Medium confidence: Execution time comparisons lacking hardware specifications and testing conditions
- Low confidence: Claim that SVM with Cohere embeddings is "most suitable option" without comprehensive evaluation of other factors

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a more comprehensive evaluation using additional metrics such as precision-recall curves, ROC analysis, and confusion matrices
2. Test the models on different datasets and chatbot environments to assess generalizability and robustness
3. Perform an ablation study to determine the impact of different embedding methods and model architectures on performance, and evaluate behavior with varying training data amounts
