# Pixels and Predictions: Potential of GPT-4V in Meteorological Imagery Analysis and Forecast Communication

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.15166
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15166
- Reference count: 40
- GPT-4V shows potential for meteorological use but requires careful human oversight and improved localization

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated GPT-4V's ability to interpret weather charts and communicate hazards in Spanish and English. GPT-4V's severe-weather outlooks aligned reasonably well with human SPC forecasts, though reasoning contained errors and vagueness. Spanish hazard summaries suffered from direct translation, losing precision and idiomatic expression. Results indicate GPT-4V has potential for meteorological applications but requires careful human oversight, explainable AI approaches, and improved localization capabilities.

## Method Summary
The study used ChatGPT's GPT-4V model with weather charts from NAM and GFS models, including geopotential height, temperature, wind, sea-level pressure, equivalent potential temperature, and simulated composite reflectivity. Researchers compared GPT-4V's severe-weather outlooks against human-issued SPC forecasts and evaluated bilingual hazard communication quality. The analysis employed a "wisdom of crowds" approach using emulations of expert forecasters to assess GPT-4V's self-evaluation capabilities.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V's severe-weather outlook aligned reasonably well with human SPC forecasts despite containing errors and vagueness in reasoning
- Spanish hazard summaries suffered from direct (non-idiomatic) translation, losing precision compared to English outputs
- GPT-4V demonstrated ability to synthesize three-dimensional atmospheric flow from multi-chart inputs, though initial responses contained hallucinations that improved through conversation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4V can synthesize a three-dimensional atmospheric flow state from multi-chart inputs despite producing initially vague or incorrect intermediate reasoning
- Mechanism: By ingesting multiple forecast fields at different pressure levels (300 hPa, 500 hPa, 850 hPa) and integrating them across the conversation, GPT-4V updates its internal atmospheric model and produces a final outlook that aligns reasonably well with human SPC forecasts
- Core assumption: GPT-4V's memory and reasoning can improve over a conversation even if earlier responses contain hallucinations or logical errors
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "GPT-4V's severe-weather outlook aligned reasonably well with human SPC forecasts, but reasoning contained errors and vagueness"; [section] "However, a human forecaster would also have access to many more meteorological charts; accordingly, we now heed the request to provide addition chart(s)"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4V's weather hazard communication in English is usable but lacks the idiomatic precision needed for public communication
- Mechanism: GPT-4V produces English summaries that capture general hazard regions and meteorological concepts, but uses vague language ("take precautions", "mixed precipitation") and non-standard terminology, reducing clarity
- Core assumption: Public weather communication requires concise, specific, and culturally appropriate language; GPT-4V's current outputs fall short
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Spanish hazard summaries suffered from direct (non-idiomatic) translation, losing precision"; [section] "There are hallucinations of scattered rain in the northeast and thunderstorms in the northwest"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4V's bilingual translation capability degrades to direct (non-idiomatic) translation, especially when generating Spanish from English
- Mechanism: GPT-4V appears to generate an English response first, then translate it directly into Spanish without adjusting for idiomatic or cultural nuance, resulting in awkward phrasing and loss of critical precision
- Core assumption: GPT-4V's training corpus over-represents English, causing it to treat English as a "bridge language" even when the target is Spanish
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Despite prompting for Spanish first, we find the English version is a direct translation of the Spanish, rather than an idiomatic one"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Token memory and context window in transformer models
  - Why needed here: GPT-4V may "forget" earlier charts or reasoning if they fall outside the token window, affecting self-consistency
  - Quick check question: If a conversation exceeds ~8k tokens, will GPT-4V still recall details from the first chart it was shown?

- Concept: Temperature parameter and stochasticity in text generation
  - Why needed here: Higher temperature increases response variability, which can lead to inconsistency and hallucinations; lowering it can make responses more deterministic
  - Quick check question: What temperature setting would minimize hallucination risk in a scientific forecasting task?

- Concept: Direct vs. idiomatic translation
  - Why needed here: GPT-4V's Spanish output was a direct translation, losing cultural and linguistic nuance critical for public communication
  - Quick check question: Why might "clima" be problematic in Spanish weather communication if used inconsistently with "weather"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GPT-4V (vision + language model) → user prompts → image + text input → output text → human evaluator
- Critical path: User uploads weather charts → GPT-4V processes and synthesizes → GPT-4V outputs forecast/outlook → user cross-checks against expert knowledge → feedback loop if needed
- Design tradeoffs: Larger token memory vs. cost/compute; higher temperature for creativity vs. deterministic output for reliability; direct translation speed vs. idiomatic quality
- Failure signatures: Hallucinations in geographic or meteorological detail; vague terminology; direct (non-idiomatic) translation; self-contradictory reasoning across conversation turns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare GPT-4V's output with and without explicit temperature setting in a forecasting task
  2. Test GPT-4V's recall by extending conversation length and checking consistency of earlier chart references
  3. Prompt GPT-4V to generate Spanish without first producing English, and compare idiomatic quality to direct translation results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can GPT-4V produce SPC-style severe weather outlooks with skill comparable to human forecasters when given comprehensive meteorological data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tested GPT-4V's ability to generate a mock SPC severe weather outlook and compared it to the actual human-issued SPC forecast, finding reasonable alignment but with some vagueness and incorrect reasoning
- Why unresolved: The test was limited to a single case study and the comparison was qualitative. The paper does not provide quantitative skill scores or conduct multiple tests to assess consistency
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of GPT-4V's severe weather outlook generation across multiple cases, with quantitative comparison to human forecasts using standard verification metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the root causes of GPT-4V's tendency to produce vague or incorrect meteorological reasoning, and can these be mitigated through improved prompting or model training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies issues with GPT-4V's meteorological reasoning, including vague responses, incorrect identification of features, and conflation of uncertainty with severe potential. However, it does not deeply investigate the underlying causes
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating GPT-4V's performance rather than diagnosing the specific reasons for its reasoning errors. It suggests the need for human oversight but doesn't explore methods to improve the model's reasoning
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying prompt structure, specificity, and model parameters to isolate factors influencing GPT-4V's meteorological reasoning quality. Analysis of the model's internal activations during reasoning tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can GPT-4V's performance in meteorological applications be improved through domain-specific fine-tuning or incorporation of meteorological knowledge bases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests GPT-4V has potential for meteorological applications but requires careful human oversight. It doesn't explore whether specialized training could enhance its performance
- Why unresolved: The experiments used GPT-4V in its default configuration without any meteorological fine-tuning or knowledge augmentation. The paper does not investigate whether these approaches could improve results
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison of GPT-4V's meteorological reasoning and forecasting performance before and after fine-tuning on meteorological datasets or incorporating structured meteorological knowledge. Assessment of whether such improvements make human oversight less critical

## Limitations

- The study lacks quantitative metrics for evaluating forecast accuracy, relying instead on qualitative comparison with human SPC forecasts
- The investigation of GPT-4V's bilingual translation capabilities was limited to a single weather event and two languages, preventing broader generalizability
- The study did not systematically test the impact of temperature settings or token window limits on forecast quality, leaving uncertainty about optimal prompting strategies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: GPT-4V can process meteorological charts and produce severe-weather outlooks that reasonably align with human forecasts when given appropriate inputs
- **Medium Confidence**: GPT-4V's bilingual hazard communication in Spanish requires improvement, as translations are direct rather than idiomatic and lose precision
- **Medium Confidence**: GPT-4V's reasoning contains errors and vagueness that can compound during conversation, requiring human oversight

## Next Checks

1. Test GPT-4V's consistency by extending conversation length beyond 8,000 tokens and verifying whether it maintains accurate references to earlier charts throughout the analysis
2. Systematically compare GPT-4V's forecast outputs using different temperature settings (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) to quantify the relationship between stochasticity and hallucination frequency in meteorological reasoning
3. Conduct controlled experiments prompting GPT-4V to generate Spanish responses without first producing English, measuring improvements in idiomatic quality and meteorological terminology precision compared to direct translation outputs
