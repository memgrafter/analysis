# Can Language Models Induce Grammatical Knowledge from Indirect Evidence?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.06022
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06022
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** Language models can learn from direct evidence but struggle to generalize from lexically or syntactically indirect evidence in certain phenomena.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether language models can acquire grammatical knowledge from indirect evidence, mirroring how humans learn language from limited exposure. The researchers created WIDET, a dataset with synthetic training instances containing newly coined words (wugs) at varying levels of indirectness, and evaluated seven linguistic phenomena. Results showed that while models perform well with direct evidence, they struggle significantly when learning from lexically or syntactically indirect evidence, particularly in phenomena involving anaphor agreement. This suggests fundamental limitations in how language models utilize indirect evidence for grammatical knowledge induction.

## Method Summary
The study used BabyBERTa, a minimal RoBERTa variant, trained on 675k sentences sampled from English Wikipedia. Researchers injected synthetic training instances with newly coined wug words at varying frequencies (n = 0, 1, 5, 25, 50, 75, 100) to create different levels of indirect evidence. Models were evaluated using pseudo-likelihood normalized by token length on grammatical acceptability tasks. The experimental design systematically varied the degree of indirectness (direct, lexically indirect, syntactically indirect) across seven linguistic phenomena including anaphor agreement, subject-verb agreement, and determiner-noun agreement.

## Key Results
- Models successfully learned from direct evidence where training instances matched evaluation instances.
- Models struggled to generalize from lexically indirect evidence, particularly in anaphor gender agreement phenomena.
- Syntactically indirect evidence showed mixed results, with some phenomena showing successful generalization while others did not.
- Distance between target words and cue words significantly impacted learning efficiency, with longer distances leading to poorer performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Language models can learn grammatical knowledge from direct evidence but struggle with lexically and syntactically indirect evidence in certain phenomena.
- **Mechanism:** Direct evidence provides identical training instances to evaluation, allowing the model to memorize and generalize. Lexically and syntactically indirect evidence require the model to infer properties from structurally similar but lexically different instances, which the model struggles with.
- **Core assumption:** The model's ability to generalize is directly related to the degree of indirectness in the training data.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Results showed that while models can learn from direct evidence, they struggle to generalize from lexically or syntactically indirect evidence in certain phenomena..."
  - [section] "We surprisingly observe that the language models do not induce grammatical knowledge in certain phenomena, even in instances that only differ in lexical items."
- **Break condition:** If the model's architecture changes to explicitly encode syntactic structures or if it's trained with more data, the break condition may be violated.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The distance between the target word (wug) and the words that act as cues for the model to learn its properties affects learning efficiency.
- **Mechanism:** Longer distances between the wug and the cue words make it harder for the model to associate the properties with the wug, leading to inefficient learning.
- **Core assumption:** The model's attention mechanism is not robust enough to handle long-distance dependencies effectively.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "This difference might be due to anaphor agreement, which often involves a longer distance between the target words and the words with properties necessary for correct judgment."
  - [section] "We find that language models generalize linguistic knowledge from training instances identical to correct evaluation instances..."
- **Break condition:** If the model's attention mechanism is improved or if the data is restructured to reduce distance, the break condition may be violated.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The presence of attractors (intervening words that distract the learner) and the number of attractors affect the model's ability to learn grammatical knowledge.
- **Mechanism:** More attractors and a higher number of attractors make it harder for the model to focus on the relevant properties, leading to less efficient learning.
- **Core assumption:** The model's ability to filter out irrelevant information is limited.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Agreement attractors indicate the intervening words that distract the learner from judging the correct agreement..."
  - [section] "We examine whether these instances affect the generalization, considering three factors related to attractors and distance..."
- **Break condition:** If the model's architecture is modified to better handle distractors or if the training data is curated to minimize attractors, the break condition may be violated.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Indirect Evidence
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding the concept of indirect evidence is crucial for interpreting the results of the study, as the study focuses on how language models use indirect evidence to learn grammatical knowledge.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between direct and indirect evidence in language acquisition?

- **Concept:** Syntactic Structure
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding syntactic structure is essential for grasping how the model generalizes from training instances to evaluation instances, especially in the context of lexically and syntactically indirect evidence.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the syntactic structure of a sentence influence its grammatical acceptability?

- **Concept:** Attention Mechanism
  - **Why needed here:** The attention mechanism is key to understanding how the model processes long-distance dependencies and handles attractors, which are critical factors in the study's findings.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the attention mechanism in transformer models work, and what are its limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pretraining data (English Wikipedia) -> Tokenizer -> BabyBERTa model -> WIDET dataset -> Evaluation
- **Critical path:** Data preparation (tokenization, injecting additional instances) -> Model training -> Evaluation using pseudo-likelihood
- **Design tradeoffs:** The study uses a small-scale language model and pretraining data to maximize the differences from human inductive biases. However, this limits the generalizability of the findings to larger models and more extensive pretraining data.
- **Failure signatures:** If the model fails to generalize from direct evidence, it indicates a fundamental issue with the model's architecture or training process. If the model struggles with indirect evidence, it suggests limitations in its ability to use latent information.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train the model on pretraining data with direct evidence and evaluate its performance on the WIDET dataset.
  2. Train the model on pretraining data with lexically indirect evidence and evaluate its performance on the WIDET dataset.
  3. Train the model on pretraining data with syntactically indirect evidence and evaluate its performance on the WIDET dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do language models' performance vary across different degrees of indirectness when trained on larger corpora and with larger model architectures?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper uses a small-scale language model and pretraining data to find differences from human inductive biases, but it is uncertain if the same trends will appear in larger models.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper explicitly acknowledges that scaling laws might apply to indirect data in accelerating model generalization, but does not explore this.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments with larger language models and corpora to compare generalization performance across different degrees of indirectness.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the impact of nonce sentences (grammatically correct but semantically meaningless sentences) on language models' ability to learn from indirect evidence?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper generates synthetic instances with LLMs that tend to produce naturally plausible sentences, avoiding nonce sentences. However, nonce sentences could exclude semantic selectional-preferences cues.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not explore the difference between natural sentences and nonce sentences in terms of their impact on language models' linguistic generalization.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing language models' performance on natural sentences vs. nonce sentences with indirect evidence.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do different methods of creating wugs (newly coined words) affect language models' ability to learn grammatical knowledge?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper compares its method of using tags like `<wug#n>` with the original wug test method that uses phonologically natural words. It finds that using actual subwords could help models access grammatical knowledge needed for accurate judgment, but complicates evaluation.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper prioritizes strictly controlled settings over settings plausible for human language acquisition, but acknowledges that the direction to the former is also a good setting depending on research questions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing language models' performance on different wug creation methods to determine their impact on linguistic generalization.

## Limitations

- **Model Scale Limitations:** The study uses a minimal model variant (BabyBERTa) with only 16M words of pretraining data, limiting generalizability to full-scale models.
- **Evaluation Method Ambiguity:** The use of pseudo-likelihood normalized by token length as the evaluation metric is not fully explored, and alternative scoring methods could affect results.
- **Synthetic Data Construction:** The generation of synthetic training instances using GPT-4 introduces potential artifacts, and the exact procedures for instance selection and balancing are not fully specified.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core finding that language models can learn from direct evidence but struggle with lexically/syn tactically indirect evidence is well-supported by consistent experimental results across multiple linguistic phenomena.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism explaining why distance between target words and cue words affects learning efficiency is plausible but not definitively proven.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific impact of attractors and their number on learning efficiency lacks systematic isolation in the experimental design.

## Next Checks

1. **Scale Validation:** Replicate the core experiments using a full-scale RoBERTa or BERT model with standard pretraining data (100B+ words) to determine whether findings generalize beyond the minimal model setting.

2. **Scoring Method Comparison:** Systematically compare evaluation results using alternative likelihood calculation methods (sentence-level, wug-level, antecedent-level) to assess robustness of findings to scoring choices.

3. **Distance Factor Isolation:** Design experiments that independently manipulate the distance between target words and cue words while holding other variables constant, to more precisely quantify the distance effect on learning efficiency.
