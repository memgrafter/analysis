# CLASP: Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining for Multilingual Multimodal Information Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13071
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces CLASP, a multilingual multimodal model for audio-text information retrieval that outperforms ASR-based methods

## Executive Summary
CLASP is a novel contrastive language-speech pretraining model designed to bridge the gap between spoken and textual content across multiple languages. The model combines self-supervised speech embeddings (Wav2Vec2 or HuBERT) with multilingual text embeddings (XLM-RoBERTa or LaBSE) through a fusion encoder network. Trained on a newly introduced Speech Brown dataset containing 55K parallel speech-text pairs across 15 categories, CLASP demonstrates superior performance compared to ASR-based retrieval methods while being more compact and efficient.

## Method Summary
CLASP integrates audio spectrograms with self-supervised speech embeddings and multilingual text embeddings through a fusion encoder network using either concatenation or gating mechanisms. The model is trained on the Speech Brown dataset (55K parallel speech-text pairs) alongside Common Voice V4 and FLEURS datasets. The architecture leverages state-of-the-art speech models (Wav2Vec2 or HuBERT) and text models (XLM-RoBERTa or LaBSE) to capture semantic meaning across modalities. Training employs a contrastive learning objective to align representations from speech and text inputs.

## Key Results
- Achieves HITS@1 score of 0.940, MRR of 0.955, and meanR of 7.710 on test set
- Outperforms Wav2Vec2 baseline (HITS@1: 0.927) and HuBERT baseline (HITS@1: 0.953)
- Demonstrates multilingual capabilities with HITS@1 scores above 0.79 across Persian, German, French, and Chinese
- Offers size advantage (1.5 GB vs 3.15 GB for HuBERT-ASR) and 10% faster inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of CLASP stems from its contrastive learning approach that aligns semantic representations across speech and text modalities. By leveraging state-of-the-art self-supervised speech embeddings (Wav2Vec2/HuBERT) and multilingual text embeddings (XLM-RoBERTa/LaBSE), the model captures rich semantic information in both modalities. The fusion encoder network effectively integrates these representations through either concatenation or gating mechanisms, allowing the model to learn shared semantic spaces that enable accurate cross-modal retrieval.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Essential for aligning representations from different modalities by pulling together matching pairs and pushing apart non-matching pairs
  - Why needed: Enables the model to learn semantic similarity across speech and text
  - Quick check: Verify that positive pairs (matching speech-text) have higher similarity scores than negative pairs

- **Self-Supervised Speech Embeddings**: Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT provide robust speech representations without requiring labeled data
  - Why needed: Eliminates dependency on ASR systems and their error propagation
  - Quick check: Confirm that speech embeddings capture phonetic and semantic information effectively

- **Multilingual Text Embeddings**: XLM-RoBERTa and LaBSE provide cross-lingual text representations
  - Why needed: Enables the model to handle multiple languages in retrieval tasks
  - Quick check: Verify that text embeddings show consistent semantic relationships across languages

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Speech embeddings (Wav2Vec2/HuBERT) -> Fusion encoder -> Text embeddings (XLM-RoBERTa/LaBSE) -> Contrastive loss

**Critical Path**: Audio input → Speech encoder → Spectrogram + Speech embeddings → Fusion encoder → Combined representation → Contrastive alignment → Retrieval output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model balances between using powerful but larger ASR-based approaches versus direct speech-text alignment. The choice of fusion mechanism (concatenation vs gating) affects both performance and computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor retrieval performance when speech and text representations are misaligned
- Suboptimal results with noisy or accented speech inputs
- Degradation in multilingual performance for low-resource languages

**Exactly 3 first experiments**:
1. Test retrieval performance on a small validation set with known ground truth to verify basic functionality
2. Compare concatenation vs gating fusion mechanisms on a subset of the training data
3. Evaluate model performance on individual languages before multilingual testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the limitations section suggests areas for future work including evaluation on larger-scale benchmarks and testing with more diverse linguistic contexts.

## Limitations
- Evaluation framework tests only on 1,000 speech-text pairs from training data, potentially limiting generalizability
- Lacks comparison with specialized retrieval models like GLAP or CLAP
- Missing evaluation on larger-scale benchmarks like Spoken COCO or SpokenWiki
- Does not address robustness to noisy speech, accented speech, or real-world audio conditions

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Performance improvements over baselines | High |
| Multilingual capability across 4 languages | Medium |
| Size and efficiency advantages | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CLASP on larger-scale benchmarks like Spoken COCO or SpokenWiki with at least 10,000+ query-speech pairs to validate retrieval performance in more realistic, challenging scenarios.

2. Conduct ablation studies testing the model's robustness to speech variations including different accents, background noise levels, and recording conditions to assess real-world applicability.

3. Compare CLASP against specialized multimodal retrieval models like GLAP or CLAP on identical test sets to establish its relative performance in the broader context of audio-text retrieval research.
