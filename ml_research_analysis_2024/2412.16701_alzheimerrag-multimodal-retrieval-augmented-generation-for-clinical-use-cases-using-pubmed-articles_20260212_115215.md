# AlzheimerRAG: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation for Clinical Use Cases using PubMed articles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16701
- Authors: Aritra Kumar Lahiri; Qinmin Vivian Hu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multimodal RAG system for Alzheimer's disease clinical use cases achieving 0.88 recall, 0.85 precision@10, and 0.86 F1-score

## Executive Summary
AlzheimerRAG is a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed for clinical use cases in Alzheimer's disease research. The system integrates textual and visual data from PubMed articles using cross-modal attention fusion techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) to optimize performance. A web-based interface enables biomedical literature retrieval with comparative evaluations showing AlzheimerRAG outperforms benchmarks like BioBERT and LlaVA-Med. Clinical case study analysis demonstrates 84% accuracy with 6% hallucination rate across five clinical scenarios.

## Method Summary
AlzheimerRAG collects and preprocesses PubMed articles related to Alzheimer's disease, extracting text, tables, and figures. The system fine-tunes Llama-2-7b-pubmed and LLaVA models using QLoRA with LoRA adapters for parameter efficiency. Cross-modal attention fusion integrates text and image embeddings through query, key, and value vector computations. FastAPI web application with LangChain Retriever and FaissDB vector storage enables interactive biomedical literature retrieval for clinical queries.

## Key Results
- AlzheimerRAG achieves 0.88 recall, 0.85 precision@10, and 0.86 F1-score on PubMed retrieval tasks
- Clinical case study accuracy of 84% with 6% hallucination rate compared to human-generated responses
- Outperforms benchmark models including BioBERT and LlaVA-Med on multimodal biomedical retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-modal attention fusion improves retrieval relevance by dynamically weighting textual and visual features
- Mechanism: Generates query, key, and value vectors from text and image embeddings; computes attention scores via dot-product similarity scaled by √dk; modulates contributions from each modality
- Core assumption: Text and image modalities contain complementary information for clinical queries
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions cross-modal attention fusion; section describes attention scoring mechanism; corpus provides weak validation
- Break condition: If text and image data are highly redundant or misaligned, attention weights become noisy

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) maintains performance while reducing memory usage
- Mechanism: Uses 4-bit NormalFloat quantization and low-rank adapter layers to update only a small subset of parameters
- Core assumption: Full fine-tuning is unnecessary for domain-specific biomedical performance
- Evidence anchors: Section mentions QLoRA usage; section describes NormalFloat quantization; corpus lacks explicit evidence
- Break condition: Large domain shift or highly specialized data may require full fine-tuning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining FaissDB search with domain-specialized LLMs yields higher accuracy and lower hallucination
- Mechanism: FaissDB indexes high-dimensional embeddings for rapid approximate nearest neighbor search; retrieved context passed to PubMed-fine-tuned LLM
- Core assumption: Retrieval quality directly impacts generative accuracy in clinical QA tasks
- Evidence anchors: Abstract reports comparative performance; section describes evaluation against GPT-4; corpus provides moderate evidence
- Break condition: Irrelevant or sparse retrieved documents lead to hallucination regardless of retrieval speed

## Foundational Learning

- Cross-modal attention fusion
  - Why needed here: Alzheimer's diagnosis requires integrating textual clinical findings with imaging data (MRI, PET scans); simple concatenation loses modality-specific nuances
  - Quick check question: In a query about amyloid-beta plaques, would you weight the image embedding more than the text embedding? Why?

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: PubMed-scale biomedical data is too large for full fine-tuning on commodity hardware; QLoRA enables practical adaptation
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference between QLoRA and full fine-tuning in terms of parameter updates?

- Vector database retrieval (FaissDB)
  - Why needed here: Biomedical literature retrieval requires sub-second response times for interactive clinical workflows
  - Quick check question: How does FaissDB's approximate nearest neighbor search differ from exact search in high-dimensional spaces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline → Text/Image chunking → Embeddings (Llama-2-7b-pubmed, LLaVA) → Cross-modal fusion → FaissDB indexing → LangChain Retriever → LLM generator → FastAPI/Jinja2 UI
- Critical path: 1. Query embedding generation, 2. FaissDB similarity search, 3. Context retrieval and fusion, 4. LLM generation
- Design tradeoffs: Memory vs. accuracy (QLoRA reduces memory but may limit adaptation), Speed vs. completeness (FaissDB ANN search is fast but may miss neighbors), Modality balance (fusion must avoid dominance by either text or image signals)
- Failure signatures: Low recall/precision (retrieval index or embedding mismatch), High hallucination (insufficient or noisy context), UI timeouts (embedding generation or FaissDB bottlenecks)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Test retrieval accuracy on held-out PubMedQA query set with/without cross-modal attention, 2. Measure hallucination rate by comparing generated answers to ground truth for clinical queries, 3. Benchmark QLoRA vs. full fine-tuning on small PubMed subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does cross-modal attention fusion specifically impact clinical case study accuracy compared to using only text or only image modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper describes cross-modal attention fusion as key innovation but lacks detailed analysis of specific contribution to clinical accuracy
- Why unresolved: Overall performance improvements shown but impact of cross-modal attention on clinical scenarios not isolated from other components
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiment comparing clinical accuracy with cross-modal attention disabled (using concatenation) while keeping other components constant

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is optimal frequency for updating AlzheimerRAG's knowledge base to maintain clinical relevance without compromising performance stability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions continuous improvements and clinician partnerships as future work, suggesting knowledge base currency is a concern
- Why unresolved: Current performance demonstrated but doesn't address how rapidly medical knowledge changes or optimal update frequency
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal study tracking performance degradation over time and measuring trade-offs between update frequency and stability

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AlzheimerRAG's performance vary across different stages of Alzheimer's disease severity, and what are clinical decision-making implications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper evaluates clinical scenarios but doesn't analyze performance variation across disease severity stages
- Why unresolved: Overall accuracy demonstrated but not broken down by disease severity or explored for clinical trust and decision-making utility
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of clinical scenario accuracy stratified by disease severity levels, coupled with clinician feedback on trust and utility

## Limitations
- System trained and evaluated exclusively on Alzheimer's disease literature, limiting generalizability to other neurodegenerative conditions
- 6% hallucination rate in clinical scenarios remains clinically significant despite being lower than baseline models
- Cross-modal attention fusion lacks ablation studies isolating its contribution from other components

## Confidence
- High confidence: Retrieval performance metrics (recall 0.88, precision@10 0.85, F1 0.86) well-supported by quantitative evaluation against benchmarks
- Medium confidence: Clinical case study results (84% accuracy, 6% hallucination) promising but limited by small sample size (5 scenarios) and lack of blinded expert review
- Low confidence: Claims about cross-modal attention fusion superiority lack direct comparative evidence against single-modality baselines

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing cross-modal attention fusion against text-only and image-only retrieval baselines on same PubMed query set
2. Perform inter-rater reliability assessment on clinical scenario responses with multiple independent medical experts to validate 84% accuracy claim
3. Test system performance on PubMed articles from other neurological conditions (Parkinson's, Huntington's) to assess domain generalizability beyond Alzheimer's disease
