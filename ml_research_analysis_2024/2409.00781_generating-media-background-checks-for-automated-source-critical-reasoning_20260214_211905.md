# Generating Media Background Checks for Automated Source Critical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.00781
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00781
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Retrieval-augmented large language models achieve 26.1% fact recall for media background checks, outperforming non-retrieval models at 22.7%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces media background checks (MBCs) as a novel task for enabling source-critical reasoning in NLP systems. MBCs are concise summaries containing trustworthiness indicators and tendencies for media sources, similar to how background checks work for individuals. The authors construct a dataset of 6,709 MBCs from Media Bias/Fact Check and demonstrate that retrieval-augmented language models significantly outperform non-retrieval approaches on fact recall metrics. Human evaluations show that generated MBCs help users better assess source trustworthiness and enable language models to provide less misleading answers when reasoning over retrieved evidence. The work establishes MBC generation as a challenging but important task for improving the reliability of information from large language models.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a dataset of 6,709 media background checks by extracting structured information from Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) ratings. They employ large language models with and without retrieval augmentation to generate MBCs, using a two-stage prompting approach where the model first extracts information and then generates the summary. Fact recall is evaluated using entailment models that check whether extracted information is supported by ground truth MBCs. Human evaluation involves crowdworkers who rate the quality and usefulness of generated MBCs compared to ground truth versions. The study also examines how MBCs affect language model performance when reasoning over retrieved evidence, measuring the impact on answer accuracy and misleadingness.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-augmented models achieve 26.1% fact recall versus 22.7% for non-retrieval models
- Generated MBCs help users better assess source trustworthiness compared to no background information
- MBCs enable LLMs to provide less misleading answers when reasoning over retrieved evidence
- Models frequently miss multi-hop facts about ownership and connections between media companies
- Open-source models like Llama 3 achieve high recall but also high error rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Media background checks work by providing structured, trustworthy context about information sources that can be used to critically evaluate content. The retrieval-augmented approach succeeds because it grounds the generation process in verified source information rather than relying solely on the model's internal knowledge, which may be outdated or unreliable. By extracting specific indicators like bias ratings, ownership details, and credibility assessments, MBCs create a framework for systematic source evaluation that mirrors human fact-checking practices. The task addresses the fundamental challenge of establishing trust in an information ecosystem where source credibility directly impacts the reliability of claims.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fact recall evaluation**: Measures how well generated content captures ground truth information from source documents. Needed to quantify model performance objectively. Quick check: Compare recall rates between retrieval and non-retrieval models.
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: The ability to infer connections between entities that require multiple inference steps. Critical because ownership and influence networks often span several relationships. Quick check: Evaluate whether models can identify parent company relationships.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Combines document retrieval with language model generation to ground outputs in external evidence. Essential for improving factual accuracy over pure generation. Quick check: Measure fact recall improvement when adding retrieval.
- **Source critical reasoning**: The process of evaluating information credibility based on source characteristics and context. The core capability MBCs aim to enable in automated systems. Quick check: Compare user trust assessments with and without MBCs.
- **Entailment-based evaluation**: Uses natural language inference models to determine if generated facts are supported by ground truth. Provides automated factuality assessment. Quick check: Validate entailment model accuracy on known fact pairs.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
User query -> Retrieval system -> Language model -> MBC generation -> Fact extraction -> Evaluation module

Critical path:
Retrieval system -> Language model generation -> Fact extraction -> Entailment evaluation

Design tradeoffs:
- Retrieval vs. generation balance: Retrieval improves fact recall but increases computational cost and potential for retrieval errors
- Model size vs. accuracy: Larger models achieve better performance but require more resources
- Fact extraction granularity: More detailed extraction enables better evaluation but increases complexity
- Human evaluation vs. automated metrics: Human judgment provides qualitative insights but is expensive and subjective

Failure signatures:
- Missing multi-hop facts about ownership and connections
- Factual errors introduced through hallucination in non-retrieval models
- Retrieval errors leading to incorporation of incorrect source information
- Bias propagation from source fact-checking data into generated MBCs

First experiments:
1. Compare fact recall rates between 3 different model sizes with identical retrieval setup
2. Ablation study removing different types of source information to identify most critical features
3. Test model performance on sources with complex ownership structures requiring multi-hop reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively evaluate multi-hop facts in media background checks, given that current entailment-based methods struggle with such complex information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of evaluating multi-hop facts in media background checks, noting that their current evaluation strategy fails to account for such facts, which are frequently omitted in generated MBCs.
- Why unresolved: Multi-hop facts, such as ownership connections between media companies, are complex and require more sophisticated evaluation methods than simple entailment. The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not propose a concrete solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new evaluation metrics or methods that can accurately assess multi-hop facts in MBCs, potentially through graph-based reasoning or other advanced techniques.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between retrieval-augmented generation and model-based generation for media background check creation, considering the trade-offs in fact recall and error rates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares models with and without retrieval, finding that retrieval improves fact recall but also introduces the potential for errors. It notes that open-source models like Llama 3 achieve high recall but also high error rates.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the optimal balance between retrieval and model-based generation, nor does it investigate techniques to mitigate the error rates associated with retrieval-augmented generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to determine the optimal ratio of retrieved information to model-generated content, and exploring techniques like fact-checking or source verification to reduce errors in retrieval-augmented generation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop more interactive systems for media background checks that allow users to explore trust at multiple levels, addressing the "turtles all the way down" problem of establishing trust in trust indicators?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the challenge of establishing trust in trust indicators, noting that information from models or retrieved documents may itself be untrustworthy. It suggests that an interactive system allowing users to expand background checks in desired directions could be a solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete proposals for developing such interactive systems or explore the user experience and effectiveness of such approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Designing and testing interactive interfaces for MBCs that allow users to drill down into trust indicators, explore source chains, and customize the level of detail they want to see, while measuring the impact on user trust and understanding.

## Limitations
- Fact recall evaluation captures only surface-level agreement rather than deeper semantic accuracy
- Dataset construction relies on existing Media Bias/Fact Check ratings, which may contain biases
- Human evaluation does not establish whether improved source trustworthiness perceptions translate to real-world behavior changes
- Current evaluation methods fail to capture multi-hop facts about ownership and influence networks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Retrieval-augmented models outperform non-retrieval models on fact recall metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Generated MBCs improve user ability to assess source trustworthiness
- **Medium confidence**: MBCs enable LLMs to provide less misleading answers when reasoning over evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess whether exposure to MBCs actually changes users' media consumption behaviors and improves their ability to identify unreliable sources over time
2. Implement adversarial testing with deliberately misleading or ambiguous source information to evaluate model robustness and identify failure modes
3. Compare generated MBCs against multiple independent fact-checking organizations to assess consistency and identify systematic biases in the generation process
