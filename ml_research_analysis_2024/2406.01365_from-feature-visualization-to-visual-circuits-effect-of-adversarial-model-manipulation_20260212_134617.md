# From Feature Visualization to Visual Circuits: Effect of Adversarial Model Manipulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.01365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01365
- Authors: Geraldin Nanfack; Michael Eickenberg; Eugene Belilovsky
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Introduces ProxPulse and CircuitBreaker attacks to manipulate feature visualizations and visual circuits, revealing fragility in circuit-based interpretability

## Executive Summary
This paper explores adversarial model manipulation in the context of neural network interpretability, specifically targeting feature visualizations and visual circuits. The authors introduce ProxPulse, a novel attack that simultaneously manipulates both synthetic and natural feature visualizations while preserving model accuracy through ball-constrained optimization. Surprisingly, they find that visual circuits discovered via structured pruning show robustness to ProxPulse. This leads to the introduction of CircuitBreaker, an attack specifically designed to manipulate visual circuits by preserving their functionality while altering their attribution scores and synthetic visualizations. Experiments on AlexNet and ResNet models demonstrate the effectiveness of both attacks and highlight the fragility of circuit-based interpretability methods.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two attacks: ProxPulse and CircuitBreaker. ProxPulse uses ball-constrained optimization to manipulate both synthetic and natural feature visualizations by pushing up the smallest activations within a ρ-ball around target images, preserving model accuracy. When visual circuits prove robust to ProxPulse, CircuitBreaker is introduced as a more targeted attack that combines ProxPulse with a ranking loss to push down the ranks of top-attributed kernels, effectively changing circuit composition while maintaining functionality. The attacks are evaluated on AlexNet and ResNet models using Kendall-τ rank correlation, CLIP-δ scores, cosine similarity, and Pearson correlation metrics across ImageNet validation set.

## Key Results
- ProxPulse successfully manipulates both synthetic and natural feature visualizations while maintaining model accuracy within 1%
- Visual circuits show surprising robustness to ProxPulse manipulation, with high Kendall-τ correlation in attribution scores
- CircuitBreaker effectively manipulates visual circuits by preserving circuit head functionality while altering attribution scores and synthetic visualizations
- Circuits become less robust when attacking multiple circuits simultaneously, suggesting potential trade-offs in attack design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ProxPulse manipulates both synthetic and natural feature visualizations simultaneously using ball-constrained optimization. The ρ-ball constraint ensures perturbations remain within a small budget while changing feature visualizations by pushing up smallest activations in the neighborhood.

### Mechanism 2
Visual circuits show robustness to ProxPulse because circuit discovery relies on kernel attribution scores that remain correlated even after fine-tuning, preserving the structure of the circuit.

### Mechanism 3
CircuitBreaker manipulates visual circuits by combining ProxPulse to maintain circuit head feature visualization with a ranking loss that pushes down ranks of top-attributed kernels, effectively changing circuit composition while preserving functionality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Adversarial model manipulation**: Understanding how adversarial fine-tuning works is crucial since the paper uses it to manipulate model interpretations. Quick check: What is the difference between adversarial example attacks and adversarial model manipulation?

- **Feature visualization**: Essential to understand since it's the primary interpretability technique being manipulated. Quick check: What are the two types of feature visualization mentioned in the paper, and how do they differ?

- **Visual circuits**: Critical to understand since they are the interpretability targets. Quick check: How are visual circuits discovered according to Hamblin et al. [2022]?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pre-trained model -> ProxPulse attack (ball-constrained optimization) -> Feature visualization manipulation -> Circuit discovery -> CircuitBreaker attack (ProxPulse + ranking loss) -> Circuit manipulation evaluation

- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize with pre-trained model, 2) Apply ProxPulse attack to manipulate feature visualizations, 3) Analyze effect on visual circuits, 4) Apply CircuitBreaker attack if circuits are robust, 5) Evaluate success using correlation and similarity metrics

- **Design tradeoffs**: ρ-ball size vs. manipulation effectiveness vs. accuracy maintenance; sparsity level in circuit discovery vs. interpretability vs. robustness; ranking loss strength vs. functionality preservation vs. circuit manipulation

- **Failure signatures**: ProxPulse: If Kendall-τ is high for conv5 but low for conv4, suggesting layer-dependent robustness; CircuitBreaker: If similarity ratio is close to 1 for circuit heads, indicating preservation of feature visualization; Both: If accuracy drops significantly (>1%), indicating the attack may be too aggressive

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run ProxPulse on conv5 of AlexNet with ρ=0.02 and evaluate Kendall-τ and CLIP-δ scores, 2) Analyze ProxPulse effect on visual circuits by computing rank correlations of attribution scores, 3) Apply CircuitBreaker to conv5 circuits with sparsity=0.6 and evaluate functional preservation using Pearson correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the effectiveness of CircuitBreaker scale with simultaneous attacks on multiple circuits versus individual circuit manipulation? The paper notes decreased manipulability success when attacking multiple circuits simultaneously without accuracy degradation, suggesting potential trade-offs.

### Open Question 2
Can robust-circuit discovery methods be designed to mitigate the effectiveness of CircuitBreaker and similar attacks? The paper concludes that visual circuits lack robustness and uniqueness, implying a need for more stable discovery methods resistant to adversarial manipulation.

### Open Question 3
What is the relationship between the sparsity level used in circuit discovery and the circuit's vulnerability to manipulation? The paper observes that reducing sparsity mitigates the effect of ProxPulse on circuits, suggesting a connection between sparsity and robustness.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends critically on ρ-ball radius choice, with unclear optimal balance between manipulation and accuracy preservation
- Limited generalizability as all experiments conducted only on ImageNet dataset
- Missing specific hyperparameter details for Adam optimizer and kernel attribution calculations, hindering full reproducibility

## Confidence
- ProxPulse effectiveness: Medium
- Circuit robustness findings: Medium
- CircuitBreaker manipulation success: Medium
- Reproducibility of results: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the ρ-ball radius to determine optimal balance between manipulation effectiveness and accuracy preservation
2. Test the attacks on multiple datasets beyond ImageNet to assess generalizability of findings
3. Implement and compare alternative circuit discovery methods to verify whether observed robustness is method-specific or a general property of visual circuits
