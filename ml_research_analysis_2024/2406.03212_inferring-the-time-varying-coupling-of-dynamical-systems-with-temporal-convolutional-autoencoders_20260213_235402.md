- This paper introduces TACI, a method for detecting time-varying causal interactions in complex dynamical systems where traditional approaches like Granger Causality fail due to nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and strong coupling.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Temporal Autoencoders for Causal Inference (TACI), a novel method for detecting time-varying causal interactions in complex dynamical systems. TACI combines a new surrogate data metric called Comparative Surrogate Granger Index with a two-headed Temporal Convolutional Network autoencoder architecture. The method trains a single model across the entire time series, allowing detection of dynamic causal relationships without retraining, and outperforms traditional approaches like Granger Causality, Convergent Cross Mapping, and Transfer Entropy in identifying unidirectional and bidirectional coupling across weak to strong coupling regimes.

## Method Summary
TACI uses a two-headed Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) autoencoder architecture where two TCNs encode time series x(t) and y(t), and a third TCN decodes the future trajectory of y(t). The method generates surrogate data by shuffling values or phases of the original time series, then trains four versions of the network: original and surrogate data for both x→y and y→x directions. The Comparative Surrogate Granger Index (CSGI) metric measures the relative improvement in predictive accuracy (R²) when using actual vs. surrogate data, normalized by the average of both R² values. This approach allows TACI to detect time-varying causal interactions without retraining separate models for different time windows.

## Key Results
- TACI accurately identifies known causal interactions and temporal variations in coupling strength that other methods miss
- The method successfully distinguishes unidirectional from bidirectional coupling across weak to strong coupling regimes
- TACI correctly handles synchronization effects in nonlinear systems where traditional Granger Causality fails

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The two-headed TCN autoencoder architecture captures complex nonlinear mappings across the entire time series without retraining. The TCN's ability to learn long-term temporal dependencies means a single trained model can identify causal interactions that vary over time, unlike traditional methods that require separate models for different time windows.

### Mechanism 2
The CSGI metric provides more robust causal inference by measuring relative improvement in predictive accuracy when using actual vs. surrogate data. This normalization allows detection of small changes in coupling strength and explicitly measures the difference in predictive power between using actual data and using surrogate data to predict the future.

### Mechanism 3
Training a single TACI model across the entire time series allows detection of dynamic causal relationships without constant retraining. The TCN architecture's ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies means the single trained model can identify causal interactions that vary over time, even when those dynamics change significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
  - Why needed here: TCNs are the core building block that allows TACI to capture long-term temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships in time series data
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between TCNs and standard CNNs that make them suitable for time series analysis?

- Concept: Granger Causality and its limitations
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional Granger Causality approaches (and why they fail in nonlinear, non-stationary systems) is crucial for appreciating why TACI's approach is necessary
  - Quick check question: What are the core assumptions of Granger Causality, and why do these assumptions often fail in real-world complex systems?

- Concept: Surrogate data generation and its role in causal inference
  - Why needed here: The surrogate data approach is central to TACI's CSGI metric, and understanding how to generate appropriate surrogate data is essential for proper implementation
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when generating surrogate data for causal inference, and how do different surrogate generation methods affect the results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Two TCN encoders (one for each time series) -> bottleneck (element-wise multiplication) -> TCN decoder (predicts future states of target variable)
- Critical path: The TCN encoders (must capture relevant features from both time series) and the bottleneck merging strategy (must effectively combine information while preserving causal signal)
- Design tradeoffs: The architecture trades off model complexity (deep TCNs can overfit) against representational capacity (shallow networks may miss complex nonlinear relationships)
- Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as inability to distinguish unidirectional from bidirectional coupling, failure to detect known causal interactions in synthetic systems, or sensitivity to noise levels
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test TACI on coupled Henon maps with known unidirectional coupling to verify basic functionality and compare against Granger Causality results
  2. Test TACI on Rössler-Lorenz system across different coupling strengths to verify detection of synchronization effects
  3. Test TACI on non-stationary coupled Henon maps with time-varying couplings to verify detection of dynamic changes in causal relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do different surrogate data generation methods (e.g., uniform random vs. Fourier-based phase randomization) affect the accuracy and robustness of TACI in detecting time-varying causal relationships? The paper mentions trying both methods but does not systematically compare their effects on TACI performance.

### Open Question 2
What are the optimal hyperparameters for TACI's TCN architecture (number of filters, kernel sizes, dilation rates, etc.) across different types of dynamical systems and data characteristics? The paper mentions hyperparameters were tuned but does not explore how different choices affect performance across various systems.

### Open Question 3
How does TACI's performance compare to other causal inference methods when applied to data with varying levels of noise, non-stationarity, and measurement artifacts commonly found in real-world systems? The paper demonstrates effectiveness on several test cases but does not systematically vary these challenging conditions.

## Limitations
- Computational cost of training four separate models (original and surrogate data for both directions) could be prohibitive for very long time series or systems with many variables
- Method's performance on complex, noisy real-world data remains partially validated, with primary validation on synthetic systems with known ground truth
- Robustness of the CSGI metric across diverse real-world systems where ground truth causal relationships are unknown

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The basic functionality of TACI in detecting known causal relationships in synthetic systems (coupled Henon maps, Rössler-Lorenz) where ground truth is available.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that TACI outperforms traditional methods like Granger Causality across all tested scenarios, particularly in real-world datasets where causal ground truth is not fully known.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that TACI can reliably detect subtle time-varying causal dynamics in highly complex, noisy real-world systems without extensive hyperparameter tuning or domain-specific modifications.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test**: Apply TACI to high-dimensional multivariate time series (5+ variables) from synthetic systems with known network structure to assess how well it scales beyond pairwise interactions and handles network effects.

2. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary noise levels in synthetic systems to determine the method's sensitivity threshold and establish guidelines for when TACI remains reliable versus when traditional methods might be preferable.

3. **Temporal Resolution Study**: Test TACI across different sampling frequencies and time series lengths to identify optimal temporal resolution for detecting causal relationships and determine minimum data requirements for reliable inference.
