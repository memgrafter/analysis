# Representative Arm Identification: A fixed confidence approach to identify cluster representatives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.14195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14195
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces RAI problem in multi-armed bandits with algorithms matching theoretical lower bounds

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Representative Arm Identification (RAI) problem in multi-armed bandits, where the goal is to identify a specified number of arms from each cluster while minimizing the number of pulls. The authors provide a lower bound on the sample complexity in terms of the bottleneck gap and propose two algorithms, Vanilla Round Robin and Butterscotch Round Robin, based on confidence intervals. These algorithms are δ-probably correct and achieve sample complexity that matches the theoretical lower bound order-wise.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two main algorithms for the RAI problem: Vanilla Round Robin and Butterscotch Round Robin. Both algorithms use confidence intervals to identify representative arms from each cluster. The Vanilla Round Robin algorithm pulls each arm in a round-robin fashion within its cluster, while Butterscotch Round Robin employs a more sophisticated sampling strategy that prioritizes arms with higher uncertainty. The algorithms maintain confidence bounds for each arm's mean reward and use these bounds to determine when sufficient evidence has been gathered to confidently identify the representative arms.

## Key Results
- Theoretical lower bound on sample complexity in terms of bottleneck gap is established
- Vanilla Round Robin and Butterscotch Round Robin algorithms achieve sample complexity matching the lower bound order-wise
- Both algorithms are proven to be δ-probably correct
- Empirical comparisons on synthetic and real-world datasets show superior performance compared to an LUCB-style baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by leveraging confidence intervals to balance exploration and exploitation. By maintaining upper and lower confidence bounds for each arm's mean reward, the algorithms can identify when sufficient evidence has been gathered to confidently select representative arms. The round-robin sampling strategy ensures that all arms within a cluster are explored sufficiently, while the confidence-based stopping criteria prevent unnecessary pulls once the representative arms can be identified with high probability.

## Foundational Learning
1. Multi-armed bandit theory - needed to understand the problem setting and basic concepts; quick check: verify understanding of regret and sample complexity
2. Confidence interval-based algorithms - needed to grasp the algorithmic approach; quick check: understand how confidence bounds are updated and used
3. Cluster-based bandit problems - needed to comprehend the specific problem formulation; quick check: recognize the difference between global and cluster-specific objectives

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Algorithm -> Confidence bounds -> Sampling strategy -> Representative identification
Critical path: Sampling arms -> Updating confidence bounds -> Checking stopping criteria -> Outputting representative arms
Design tradeoffs: Balancing exploration (sampling all arms) vs. exploitation (stopping early when confident); using round-robin vs. adaptive sampling strategies
Failure signatures: Incorrect identification of representative arms due to insufficient sampling; excessive sample complexity due to overly conservative confidence bounds
First experiments: 1) Run algorithms on a simple 2-cluster problem with known gaps to verify correctness 2) Test performance on a synthetic dataset with varying cluster sizes and gaps 3) Compare sample complexity against theoretical bounds on a controlled problem instance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on stationary bandit settings may limit applicability to non-stationary or adversarial environments
- Assumes prior knowledge of the number of arms per cluster, which may not always be available
- Potential scalability issues with large numbers of clusters or arms per cluster

## Confidence
- Theoretical guarantees: High confidence in correctness proofs of proposed algorithms
- Empirical comparisons: Medium confidence due to limited scope of tested scenarios
- Sample complexity bounds: High confidence in theoretical analysis, Medium confidence in practical tightness
- Algorithm scalability: Low confidence due to lack of extensive testing on large-scale problems

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithms on additional real-world datasets with varying reward distributions and cluster structures to assess robustness and generalization
2. Extend the theoretical analysis to non-stationary settings or provide empirical evidence of performance in such environments
3. Conduct a more extensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of design choices on algorithm performance across different problem instances
