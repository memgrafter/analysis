# How Much Can Time-related Features Enhance Time Series Forecasting?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01557
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TimeLinear achieves 23% MSE reduction on benchmark datasets using time-related features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TimeLinear, a novel approach for long-term time series forecasting that explicitly incorporates time-related features such as season, month, day of the week, hour, and minute. The core innovation is TimeSter, a lightweight module that encodes historical time-related features into a hidden space, which is then combined with predictions from a simple linear backbone model based on historical observations. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven real-world datasets while using only 100k to 1M parameters, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness.

## Method Summary
TimeLinear uses a two-stage approach: TimeSter encodes historical time-related features (U) into hidden representations, while a linear backbone processes normalized historical observations. The model combines both predictions using a weighted sum with coefficient β. Simplified reversible instance normalization (RevIN) is applied to historical observations and final forecasts. The approach specifically targets long-term forecasting (T ≥ 96) by leveraging deterministic time-related features to capture cyclical patterns that would be missed by observing raw values alone.

## Key Results
- Achieves 23% reduction in Mean Squared Error compared to using a single linear projector
- Outperforms existing methods on Electricity and Traffic datasets with 321 variables
- Uses only 100k to 1M parameters while maintaining state-of-the-art performance across seven real-world datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness when historical input is limited by leveraging time-related features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Encoding time-related features separately captures periodic patterns that would be missed by observing raw values alone. Time-related features (hour, day, month, season) encode the cyclical structure of time series. When these are mapped to a hidden space via a learnable encoder, the model can represent periodic dependencies without needing to infer them from noisy observations.

### Mechanism 2
Combining predictions from a time-stamp-based model with a historical-observation-based model improves accuracy over either alone. The TimeSter module captures predictable periodic trends, while the backbone model captures residual variations and noise. Weighted summation of both predictions leverages complementary strengths.

### Mechanism 3
Using simplified reversible instance normalization improves generalization by mitigating distribution shift. Normalizing historical observations and denormalizing final forecasts using the same statistics reduces sensitivity to varying scales and outliers in the input data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cyclical patterns in time series (daily, weekly, seasonal)**: Why needed here? Time-related features encode these patterns; without understanding them, one cannot judge their usefulness. Quick check: Why does electricity consumption at noon vary less within a season than between seasons?

- **Conditional probability modeling (p(xᵢ|Uᵢ))**: Why needed here? TimeSter assumes observations depend on time-related features; this is the modeling foundation. Quick check: If time-related features fully determine observations, why would historical observations still be needed?

- **Tradeoff between bias and variance in model combination**: Why needed here? The weighted sum of TimeSter and backbone predictions balances bias (from periodicity) and variance (from residuals). Quick check: What happens if β = 0 or β = 1 in the final prediction formula?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Historical observations X → Linear backbone → YB; Historical time-related features U → TimeSter encoder → YU; YB + (1-β)YU → Final prediction Y'

- **Critical path**: 1) Input: historical observations X (L x V), historical time-related features U (L x r); 2) Normalize X → ˆX; 3) TimeSter(U) → YU; 4) Backbone(ˆX) → YB; 5) Combine: Y' = βYB + (1-β)YU; 6) Denormalize: ˆY' = Y' × √(σ²+ε) + μ

- **Design tradeoffs**: TimeSter vs. backbone contribution (β hyperparameter); encoder depth vs. parameter efficiency; inclusion of all time-related features vs. dataset-specific selection

- **Failure signatures**: High MSE but stable predictions → time-related features poorly chosen or encoded; Erratic predictions → normalization statistics incorrect or backbone too weak; No improvement over linear baseline → TimeSter not capturing relevant periodicities

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replace TimeSter with identity (input U → output) and compare MSE on Electricity dataset; 2) Set β = 0 (backbone only) vs. β = 1 (TimeSter only) on Traffic dataset; 3) Vary encoder depth (0, 1, 2 hidden layers) on Weather dataset and measure impact on seasonal pattern capture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The specific hyperparameter values for β (the combination coefficient) and learning rate are not provided, which could affect reproducibility
- Implementation details of the TimeSter encoder architecture beyond the high-level description are unclear
- The claim of "state-of-the-art performance" across seven datasets is based on comparisons with only three baseline methods

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core mechanism: The theoretical justification for combining time-related features with historical observations is sound, and the basic architecture is clearly specified
- **Medium confidence** in performance claims: While the 23% MSE reduction is impressive, the limited baseline comparisons and missing hyperparameter details reduce certainty
- **Medium confidence** in generalization: The use of RevIN normalization assumes training and test data share similar distributions, which may not hold in practice

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies varying β across the full range [0,1] to determine optimal combination ratios for different datasets and validate the claimed benefits of model combination

2. Test TimeLinear on additional benchmark datasets (e.g., exchange rate, solar energy) that include different seasonal patterns to assess robustness beyond the seven reported datasets

3. Compare against recent transformer-based and attention-based models like Informer or FEDformer on the same datasets to establish stronger claims about state-of-the-art performance
