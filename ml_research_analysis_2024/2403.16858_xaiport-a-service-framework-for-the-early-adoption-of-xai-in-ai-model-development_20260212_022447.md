# XAIport: A Service Framework for the Early Adoption of XAI in AI Model Development

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.16858
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16858
- Reference count: 40
- Framework improves F1-scores from 0.839 to 0.905 for Azure Cognitive Services

## Executive Summary
XAIport is a microservice-based framework designed to facilitate early adoption of Explainable AI (XAI) in machine learning development. The framework addresses three critical properties: quality of explanation through consistency metrics, architectural compatibility with cloud AI services via open APIs, and configurable operations with measurable XAI processes. XAIport provides unified access to multiple XAI methods and evaluates explanation quality through stability and consistency metrics. A pilot study using three major cloud computer vision services demonstrated measurable improvements in both model performance and explanation stability.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates XAI methods with cloud-based AI services through a microservice architecture that provides unified access to multiple explanation techniques. XAIport evaluates explanation quality using stability and consistency metrics, specifically measuring how explanations remain coherent across different XAI methods and model predictions. The pilot implementation tested three cloud computer vision services (Azure Cognitive Services, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Amazon Rekognition) and measured performance improvements alongside computational overhead. The evaluation framework introduced novel stability metrics to quantify explanation quality while tracking operational costs and deployment times across platforms.

## Key Results
- F1-score improvements from 0.839 to 0.905 for Azure Cognitive Services
- Explanation stability metrics improved from 22.227 to 0.002
- Computational overhead remains comparable to traditional ML with reasonable deployment times across cloud platforms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
XAIport's effectiveness stems from its microservice architecture that decouples XAI operations from core ML models, enabling modular integration with existing cloud services. The framework's stability metrics provide quantitative measures of explanation consistency across different XAI methods, allowing developers to identify and select the most reliable explanations. By providing unified access through open APIs, XAIport eliminates vendor lock-in while maintaining compatibility with diverse cloud platforms. The configurable operations enable measurable XAI processes that can be tuned for specific use cases, improving both explanation quality and model performance through iterative refinement.

## Foundational Learning
- Microservice architecture principles: Why needed - enables modular integration and scalability; Quick check - can individual services be deployed and scaled independently?
- XAI stability metrics: Why needed - provides quantitative measures of explanation consistency; Quick check - do stability scores correlate with explanation usefulness?
- Cloud API integration patterns: Why needed - ensures compatibility across different AI service providers; Quick check - can framework adapt to API changes without breaking functionality?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Client -> API Gateway -> XAI Service Manager -> XAI Method Adapters -> Cloud AI Services
Critical path: Request -> Authentication -> Method Selection -> Explanation Generation -> Result Aggregation
Design tradeoffs: Flexibility vs. performance overhead, unified interface vs. platform-specific optimizations
Failure signatures: API timeout errors, inconsistent explanation outputs, computational resource exhaustion
First experiments:
1. Deploy single XAI method adapter with one cloud service and verify basic functionality
2. Test explanation stability metrics with controlled input variations
3. Measure computational overhead under varying request loads

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to computer vision tasks only
- Validation performed on only two specific datasets (MNIST and COVIDx)
- Stability metrics introduced haven't been validated against established benchmarks

## Confidence

- Cross-platform compatibility claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across diverse ML task types (regression, NLP, tabular data) beyond computer vision
2. Validate explanation stability metrics against established XAI evaluation benchmarks and alternative measurement approaches
3. Conduct longitudinal studies measuring framework performance under varying computational loads and real-world deployment scenarios with concurrent users
