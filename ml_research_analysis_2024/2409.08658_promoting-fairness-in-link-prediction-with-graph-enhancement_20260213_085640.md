# Promoting Fairness in Link Prediction with Graph Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08658
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08658
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: FairLink improves fairness in link prediction without modifying training processes, achieving better fairness-utility trade-offs while maintaining generalizability across GNN architectures.

## Executive Summary
FairLink is a data-centric method that enhances fairness in link prediction by learning a synthetic fairness-enhanced graph rather than modifying the training process of graph neural networks. The approach optimizes a dyadic fairness loss to ensure equal link probabilities between nodes from different sensitive groups and those from the same group, while preserving utility by minimizing gradient distance between the enhanced and original graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graphs demonstrate that FairLink significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining competitive link prediction accuracy and strong generalizability across different GNN architectures.

## Method Summary
FairLink learns a fairness-enhanced graph by alternating between optimizing synthetic graph features and edge probability modeling. The method optimizes a dyadic fairness loss that minimizes the difference in average link prediction probabilities between intra-group and inter-group node pairs, ensuring equal treatment regardless of sensitive attribute similarity. To preserve utility, FairLink minimizes the gradient distance between the original and synthetic graphs across training epochs, ensuring comparable link prediction accuracy. The synthetic graph can then be used with any GNN architecture for fair link prediction, decoupling fairness improvement from the training process.

## Key Results
- FairLink significantly improves dyadic fairness metrics (∆DP and ∆EO) across multiple large-scale graphs while maintaining competitive link prediction accuracy
- The enhanced graph exhibits strong generalizability across different GNN architectures including GraphSAGE, GCN, and GAT
- FairLink achieves better fairness-utility trade-offs compared to baseline methods including VGAE, Node2vec, FairPR, Fairwalk, and others

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FairLink improves fairness by learning a synthetic graph that balances link probabilities between node pairs within the same sensitive group and those from different sensitive groups.
- Mechanism: FairLink optimizes a dyadic fairness loss function that measures the absolute difference in average link prediction probabilities between intra-group and inter-group node pairs. By minimizing this difference, the synthetic graph enforces equal treatment in link predictions regardless of sensitive attribute similarity.
- Core assumption: The link prediction model trained on the synthetic graph will inherit the fairness properties of the graph, even if the model itself is not fairness-aware.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus]
- Break condition: If the link predictor does not preserve the distributional properties of the synthetic graph during training, the fairness improvements may not transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FairLink preserves utility by minimizing the gradient distance between the original graph and the synthetic graph.
- Mechanism: FairLink computes gradients of the cross-entropy loss with respect to link predictor parameters for both the original and synthetic graphs. It then minimizes the distance between these gradients across training epochs, ensuring that the synthetic graph follows a similar optimization trajectory as the original graph.
- Core assumption: Matching gradient trajectories across epochs ensures that a model trained on the synthetic graph will achieve similar performance to one trained on the original graph.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus]
- Break condition: If the gradient distance metric fails to capture essential information about the graph structure, the synthetic graph may lose critical utility.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FairLink generalizes well across different GNN architectures because the synthetic graph encodes fairness and utility in a model-agnostic way.
- Mechanism: By learning a fairness-enhanced graph independently of any specific GNN architecture, FairLink decouples the fairness improvement from the training process. This allows the synthetic graph to be reused across multiple architectures without retraining.
- Core assumption: The graph structure and link distributions encoded in the synthetic graph are sufficient to guide fair link prediction regardless of the underlying GNN architecture.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus]
- Break condition: If certain GNN architectures are highly sensitive to specific graph structural features not preserved in the synthetic graph, performance may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dyadic fairness in link prediction
  - Why needed here: FairLink explicitly optimizes for dyadic fairness, which requires equal link prediction probabilities between nodes from the same sensitive group and nodes from different groups.
  - Quick check question: How is dyadic fairness formally defined in terms of conditional probabilities for link prediction?

- Concept: Gradient matching for dataset distillation
  - Why needed here: FairLink uses gradient distance to ensure the synthetic graph preserves the training dynamics of the original graph, a technique borrowed from dataset condensation literature.
  - Quick check question: Why is matching gradient trajectories more effective than simply matching graph statistics for preserving utility?

- Concept: Multi-objective optimization in graph learning
  - Why needed here: FairLink jointly optimizes fairness and utility losses, requiring understanding of trade-offs and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Quick check question: How do the fairness loss weight (α) and utility loss weight (β) influence the balance between fairness and accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input graph G with adjacency matrix A and node features X -> Synthetic graph Gf initialized with random edges -> Link predictor (e.g., GraphSAGE) parameterized by θ -> Fairness loss Lfair measuring dyadic fairness gap -> Utility loss Lutil measuring gradient distance between G and Gf -> MLP ψ modeling edge probabilities in Gf -> Alternating optimization between Xf and ψ

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize synthetic graph Gf with random edges
  2. For each training epoch:
     a. Compute link prediction loss and gradients for G and Gf
     b. Update synthetic graph features Xf to minimize Lutil + αLfair
     c. Update MLP ψ to model edge probabilities
  3. Output fairness-enhanced graph Gf∗
  4. Train any GNN on Gf∗ for fair link prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fairness vs. utility: Increasing α improves fairness but may degrade accuracy
  - Graph size: Maintaining same size as input graph simplifies deployment but may limit scalability
  - Optimization complexity: Alternating optimization between Xf and ψ adds training overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - If utility loss dominates, fairness improvements will be minimal
  - If fairness loss dominates, link prediction accuracy will degrade significantly
  - If alternating optimization fails to converge, the synthetic graph may be unstable

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate that FairLink improves dyadic fairness (∆DP, ∆EO) compared to VGAE on Pubmed
  2. Test that link prediction accuracy (F1, AUC) on the synthetic graph matches the original graph
  3. Evaluate cross-architecture generalization by training GCN, GAT, and VGAE on the synthetic graph

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the scale-sensitive gradient distance function (combining cosine and Euclidean distances) compare to other potential distance metrics for measuring gradient similarity in graph condensation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors introduce a novel scale-sensitive distance function that combines cosine and Euclidean distances, arguing that cosine distance alone is insufficient because it ignores gradient magnitude.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not benchmark this combined metric against other alternatives like Mahalanobis distance, KL divergence of gradient distributions, or other norm-based metrics that could also capture scale sensitivity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of different distance metrics on the same tasks, measuring their impact on both fairness and utility preservation in the learned graphs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between the dyadic fairness loss and other fairness definitions (such as equalized odds or fairness through awareness) in the context of link prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors adopt dyadic fairness (demographic parity for link prediction) but do not explore how this relates to other fairness definitions or whether stronger fairness guarantees could be achieved with different formulations.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on dyadic fairness without theoretical analysis of its properties or comparison to alternative fairness definitions that might be more appropriate for link prediction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal proofs or empirical studies showing the implications of different fairness definitions on link prediction performance and whether stronger or alternative fairness notions could be incorporated into the framework.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does FairLink perform when applied to graphs with multiple sensitive attributes or intersectional fairness considerations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The experiments only consider single sensitive attributes (topic, continent, gender), and the dyadic fairness formulation is defined for binary sensitive attributes.
- Why unresolved: Real-world graphs often have multiple or hierarchical sensitive attributes, and the current formulation would need to be extended to handle these cases, which the paper does not address.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets with multiple sensitive attributes, analysis of how the fairness loss generalizes to multi-attribute settings, and potential modifications to the dyadic fairness formulation to handle intersectional fairness.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs between the alternating optimization strategy used in FairLink and joint optimization of the fairness-enhanced graph and the predictor?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that joint optimization is challenging and employ an alternating optimization strategy, but do not compare this approach to other optimization schemes.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore whether joint optimization (possibly with better initialization or optimization techniques) could yield better results, or analyze the computational complexity differences between approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of alternating optimization versus joint optimization in terms of convergence speed, final performance, and computational resources required, along with analysis of optimization landscapes.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness on graphs with different structural properties (community structure, node degree distributions) remains unclear
- The alternating optimization process may struggle to converge on very large graphs due to computational constraints
- The cross-architecture generalizability claim lacks empirical validation across a broader range of GNN models

## Confidence
- Dyadic fairness mechanism: Medium confidence
- Gradient matching for utility preservation: Medium confidence
- Cross-architecture generalizability: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test FairLink on graphs with varying structural properties (e.g., power-law degree distribution, small-world networks) to assess robustness
2. Evaluate the method's performance when trained link predictors have different inductive biases (e.g., GCN vs GAT vs GraphSAGE)
3. Measure the sensitivity of fairness improvements to the initial synthetic graph structure and random seed variations
