# Statistical Edge Detection And UDF Learning For Shape Representation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.03381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03381
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Statistical method for edge detection on 3D surfaces improves Neural UDF learning by 15% on average with 76-88% of shapes benefiting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel statistical method for edge detection on 3D surfaces represented as point clouds, which significantly improves Neural Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) learning. The key innovation is using a goodness-of-fit test on projected neighboring points to identify surface edges, overcoming limitations of traditional geometric descriptors on sharp or folded surfaces. By concentrating learning effort on detected edges through oversampling, the method achieves more accurate surface reconstructions, with experiments on ShapeNet showing substantial improvements in Hausdorff distance metrics.

## Method Summary
The method uses statistical goodness-of-fit tests to detect edges on 3D point clouds by examining central symmetry of projected neighboring points. For each point, the algorithm projects its k-nearest neighbors onto the average plane of the local neighborhood and tests whether these projections are symmetrically distributed around the point's projection. To ensure invariance to polar axis choice, angles are centered using their Fréchet mean before applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The resulting p-values indicate edge likelihood, and training points for UDF learning are oversampled around detected edges to improve local accuracy. The method is evaluated by comparing UDF reconstruction quality with and without edge-aware sampling on ShapeNet datasets.

## Key Results
- 15% average improvement in surface reconstruction quality through edge-aware UDF learning
- 76-88% of tested shapes showed benefits from the edge detection method
- Outperforms traditional geometric descriptors like Pauly's method on sharp and folded surfaces
- Statistical edge detection enables more expressive 3D shape representations through focused neural training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Edge detection is achieved by testing the central symmetry of projected neighboring points around a centroid.
- Mechanism: The method projects neighboring points onto the average plane of the local neighborhood, then tests if these projected points are symmetrically distributed around the centroid's projection using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test on polar angles.
- Core assumption: Symmetric distribution around the centroid indicates a locally planar surface, while asymmetric distribution indicates an edge.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states the key idea is using goodness-of-fit tests on projected neighboring points to identify surface edges.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The choice of polar axis for the symmetry test does not affect the result due to Fréchet centering.
- Mechanism: Before performing the symmetry test, the polar angles of the projected points are centered using their Fréchet mean, making the test invariant to the choice of reference axis for polar coordinates.
- Core assumption: Centering angles around their Fréchet mean removes dependency on the reference axis.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions angles are centered using Fréchet mean to avoid dependence on polar axis choice.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Oversampling training points around detected edges improves the local accuracy of the Neural UDF.
- Mechanism: By concentrating training effort on points near surface edges, the Neural UDF learns to represent these critical shape-defining features more accurately.
- Core assumption: Edges are the most challenging parts of a surface to represent accurately, and focusing learning effort on them improves overall reconstruction.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states the key idea is to concentrate learning effort of the Neural UDF on surface edges.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Goodness-of-fit tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
  - Why needed here: To assess central symmetry of projected points around the centroid, indicating whether the surface is locally planar or has an edge.
  - Quick check question: What is the null hypothesis in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for central symmetry?

- Concept: Fréchet mean
  - Why needed here: To center the polar angles of projected points, making the symmetry test invariant to the choice of reference axis.
  - Quick check question: How does the Fréchet mean differ from the arithmetic mean for circular data?

- Concept: Unsigned Distance Functions (UDFs)
  - Why needed here: The method improves UDF learning by focusing on edges, which are critical for accurate shape representation.
  - Quick check question: How does a UDF differ from a Signed Distance Function (SDF)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Edge detection module -> Sampling module -> UDF learning module -> Evaluation module
- Critical path: Edge detection → Sampling → UDF learning → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Scale parameter k: Larger k captures larger-scale edges but may miss fine details
  - Decision threshold p0: Higher p0 is more conservative in detecting edges but may miss some
  - Oversampling parameter ξ: Higher ξ focuses more on edges but may neglect planar areas
- Failure signatures:
  - False positives: Non-edge areas detected as edges (e.g., thin plates)
  - False negatives: Edges not detected (e.g., very sharp edges)
  - Poor UDF accuracy: If edge detection is inaccurate, the UDF will not be well-represented around edges
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test edge detection on synthetic shapes with known edges (e.g., cones, folds, thin plates)
  2. Compare UDF accuracy with and without edge-based oversampling on ShapeNet chairs
  3. Evaluate impact of scale parameter k and decision threshold p0 on edge detection accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the statistical edge detection method perform on real-world noisy 3D point cloud data with significant missing points or occlusions?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from paper evaluating on ShapeNet dataset which likely contains relatively clean and complete 3D models
- Why unresolved: Real-world 3D scanning often produces noisy point clouds with missing data, occlusions, and varying point density
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on real-world 3D scanned data with known noise levels, missing points, and occlusions, comparing performance to geometric descriptors

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational complexity of the statistical edge detection method, and how does it scale with the number of points and neighborhood size?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from paper mentioning the method can be computationally costly for large numbers of surface points
- Why unresolved: Understanding computational efficiency is crucial for practical application, especially for large-scale 3D models
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of time complexity including impact of neighborhood size and number of points, benchmarking against other methods

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the method to the choice of parameters (e.g., neighborhood size, p-value threshold) for different types of 3D shapes and surface characteristics?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion of empirical parameter choice for ShapeNet data without systematic sensitivity analysis
- Why unresolved: Method's performance may vary significantly depending on parameter choice
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive sensitivity analysis across diverse 3D shapes with varying surface characteristics, exploring different parameter settings

## Limitations

- Method effectiveness relies heavily on local neighborhood central symmetry assumption, which may not hold for complex geometries with very sharp features or multiple overlapping edges
- Choice of scale parameter k and decision threshold p0 significantly impacts accuracy, but systematic study of these parameters is not provided
- Performance on real-world data with noise and artifacts is not evaluated, limiting practical applicability assessment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of using statistical tests for edge detection and improvement of UDF learning through edge-aware sampling are well-supported by experimental results and mathematical framework
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that method outperforms traditional geometric descriptors is supported by ShapeNet experiments, but more extensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen this claim
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion that method can handle all types of surface geometries is not fully validated, as experiments focus on subset of ShapeNet categories

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic study of impact of scale parameter k and decision threshold p0 on edge detection accuracy and resulting UDF learning performance to identify optimal parameter settings
2. Evaluate method's performance on real-world point cloud data with noise and artifacts from LiDAR scans or 3D reconstruction algorithms to assess robustness
3. Compare proposed method with recent state-of-the-art edge detection and UDF learning techniques on diverse set of 3D shapes including those with complex geometries and fine details
