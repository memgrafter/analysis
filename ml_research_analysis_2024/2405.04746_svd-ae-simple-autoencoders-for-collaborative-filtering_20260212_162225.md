## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SVD-AE, a simple yet effective singular vector decomposition (SVD)-based linear autoencoder for collaborative filtering. Unlike existing autoencoder-based methods that rely on regularization parameters, SVD-AE directly uses truncated SVD as a low-rank inductive bias to avoid overfitting noisy interactions. The method leverages truncated SVD to obtain a closed-form solution that reconstructs user-item interactions while effectively reducing noise. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SVD-AE achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy (HR@10, NDCG@10, PSP@10), robustness to noise, and computational efficiency compared to eight state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
SVD-AE uses truncated SVD to compute a closed-form solution B = VΣ+Q^T R, where B reconstructs the interaction matrix. The method leverages truncated SVD as a low-rank inductive bias to avoid overfitting noisy interactions, unlike existing autoencoder-based methods that rely on regularization parameters. Only hyperparameter is γ ∈ [0.01, 0.05] controlling rank m = ⌊γ × min(|U|, |I|)⌉. The approach involves preprocessing datasets by computing normalized matrices, performing truncated SVD, and reconstructing interaction matrices for evaluation.

## Key Results
- SVD-AE achieves superior accuracy (HR@10, NDCG@10, PSP@10) compared to eight state-of-the-art baselines
- The method demonstrates robustness to noise and computational efficiency
- γ = 0.04 is optimal for all datasets tested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SVD-AE works by leveraging truncated SVD as a low-rank inductive bias to reconstruct user-item interactions while reducing noise. The closed-form solution avoids the need for regularization parameters and directly addresses the overfitting problem common in autoencoder-based methods. The method's simplicity and effectiveness stem from using the mathematical properties of SVD to capture the essential structure of the interaction matrix while filtering out noise.
