# Discovery of Rare Causal Knowledge from Financial Statement Summaries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.01748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01748
- Reference count: 19
- The method achieved an average precision of 0.80 in extracting rare causal knowledge from Japanese financial statement summaries

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for extracting rare causal knowledge from Japanese financial statement summaries to support individual investors' decision-making. The approach combines machine learning with extended language ontology features to identify causal sentences, then applies syntactic pattern matching and a scoring algorithm that considers both conditional probabilities and company keyword relevance. Evaluated on 106,885 financial summaries, the method successfully identified non-obvious causal relationships such as how weather patterns affect flower blooming and create market shortages, demonstrating potential for uncovering investment opportunities that traditional analysis might miss.

## Method Summary
The proposed method operates in three sequential steps to extract rare causal knowledge from financial statement summaries. First, it uses machine learning with extended language ontology features to identify sentences containing causal knowledge. Second, it applies syntactic pattern matching to extract cause-effect expressions from these identified sentences. Finally, it employs a scoring algorithm that combines conditional probabilities with company keyword relevance to identify the rarest and potentially most valuable causal relationships. The method was evaluated on a large dataset of 106,885 Japanese financial summaries, achieving an average precision of 0.80, which outperformed baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved average precision of 0.80 in extracting rare causal knowledge from Japanese financial statement summaries
- Successfully identified non-obvious causal relationships, such as weather impacts on flower blooming and market shortages
- Outperformed baseline approaches in precision metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by systematically identifying and prioritizing causal relationships that are both present in financial statements and sufficiently rare to provide investment insights. By combining syntactic pattern matching with conditional probability scoring weighted by company relevance, the approach can surface unexpected connections that traditional analysis might overlook. The use of extended language ontology features helps capture nuanced causal expressions in Japanese text, while the multi-step filtering process ensures that only the most relevant and rare causal knowledge is extracted for investor consideration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Machine learning with language ontology**: Required for identifying causal sentences in financial text; quick check: evaluate feature importance and model accuracy
- **Syntactic pattern matching**: Needed to extract cause-effect relationships from identified causal sentences; quick check: validate pattern coverage against known causal expressions
- **Conditional probability scoring**: Essential for quantifying the rarity and relevance of causal relationships; quick check: compare scoring results with domain expert judgments
- **Company keyword relevance weighting**: Critical for prioritizing causal knowledge specific to individual companies; quick check: assess keyword selection impact on final results

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Sentence Extraction (ML + Ontology) -> Syntactic Pattern Matching -> Conditional Probability Scoring -> Rare Knowledge Output

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from machine learning-based sentence identification through syntactic pattern extraction to final scoring. Each stage must complete successfully for the next to proceed, with the scoring algorithm representing the final bottleneck where computational complexity increases with the number of identified causal relationships.

### Design Tradeoffs
The approach trades computational complexity for precision by using multiple filtering stages rather than attempting to identify rare causal knowledge in a single pass. The use of manually constructed syntactic patterns provides high precision but may miss novel causal expressions. The conditional probability scoring provides quantitative rigor but requires sufficient data volume to generate meaningful probabilities.

### Failure Signatures
Failure modes include: ML model failing to identify causal sentences (low recall), syntactic patterns missing relevant causal expressions (precision loss), insufficient data for reliable probability estimates (scoring inaccuracies), and keyword weighting producing irrelevant results (ranking errors).

### First 3 Experiments
1. Validate sentence extraction precision and recall against manually annotated causal sentences
2. Test syntactic pattern matching coverage against diverse causal expression samples
3. Evaluate scoring algorithm performance on known rare causal relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted solely on Japanese text, limiting generalizability to other languages and financial contexts
- Reliance on manually constructed syntactic patterns may not capture all relevant causal expressions
- Scoring algorithm effectiveness in identifying truly rare but valuable causal relationships remains to be validated through real-world investment outcomes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology for sentence extraction using machine learning with extended language ontology features
- **Medium confidence**: The overall precision score of 0.80 and its comparison to baseline methods
- **Low confidence**: The method's ability to identify genuinely rare and valuable causal relationships for investment decisions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a multi-language evaluation using financial statement summaries in English and other major languages to assess generalizability
2. Perform a longitudinal study tracking the actual investment performance of decisions based on the extracted rare causal knowledge
3. Evaluate the method's recall rate and compare its coverage of causal relationships against comprehensive financial knowledge bases
