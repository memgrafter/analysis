# Modelling Visual Semantics via Image Captioning to extract Enhanced Multi-Level Cross-Modal Semantic Incongruity Representation with Attention for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.02595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02595
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposed model achieves 92.89% accuracy on Twitter dataset and 64.48% on MultiBully dataset for multimodal sarcasm detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multimodal sarcasm detection framework that leverages image captioning to capture semantic incongruity between text and visual content. The approach uses a cross-lingual language model for multilingual text and caption feature extraction, a self-regulated residual ConvNet with lightweight spatially aware attention for image features, and an encoder-decoder transformer for caption generation. Multi-head attention and co-attention mechanisms model incongruities at different semantic levels, followed by feature fusion for final classification. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on Twitter and MultiBully datasets, validating the effectiveness of multi-level incongruity representation for sarcasm detection.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework extracts textual features using a cross-lingual language model, visual features using a self-regulated residual ConvNet with lightweight spatially aware attention, and generates image captions using an encoder-decoder transformer. It models incongruity between text and image features using multi-head self-attention, and between text and captions using co-attention mechanisms. These multi-level incongruity representations are then fused through concatenation and classified using a softmax layer with L2-regularized binary cross-entropy loss optimized by Adam.

## Key Results
- Achieves 92.89% accuracy on Twitter dataset and 64.48% on MultiBully dataset for multimodal sarcasm detection
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness of multi-level cross-modal semantic incongruity representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-lingual language model captures multilingual semantic context effectively for sarcasm detection.
- Mechanism: Uses a cross-lingual model pretrained on 100+ languages, enabling it to process code-mixed English-Hindi statements in the MultiBully dataset without additional language-specific fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The shared multilingual embeddings contain sufficient semantic alignment to detect incongruity in mixed-language sarcastic expressions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "cross-lingual language model is employed as the textual tokenizer and encoder to acquire the feature representations for both the text data and the image captions... particularly advantageous as the MultiBully dataset consists of code-mixed English-Hindi statements."
  - [section 3.2] "masked language model [44] has already been pre-trained on over a hundred languages, including Hindi... this particular variant of [46] for our investigation since the majority of the input sentences in the 'MultiBully' meme dataset are code-mixed Hindi-English."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct neighbor paper on multilingual sarcasm detection found; claim based on general cross-lingual LM capabilities.
- Break condition: Performance degrades when Hindi and English tokens are semantically misaligned in the shared embedding space, or when sarcasm relies on culturally specific idioms not captured in the pretraining corpus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-regulated residual ConvNet with lightweight spatially aware attention enhances visual feature representation by emphasizing salient regions.
- Mechanism: The self-regulated residual ConvNet extracts regional feature maps from the input image, then the lightweight spatially aware attention module applies horizontal and vertical pooling to generate attention maps that refine these features by focusing on important spatial regions without heavy computational overhead.
- Core assumption: Sarcasm-relevant visual cues are localized in specific spatial regions, and capturing these regions with directionally-aware attention improves incongruity detection with text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "visual feature extraction branch that incorporates a self-regulated residual ConvNet integrated with a lightweight spatially aware attention module"
  - [section 3.3.2] "we incorporate a simple and flexible attention mechanism [48] that imposes a minimal computational load... precise positioning information can be maintained along one spatial dimension while long-range dependencies can be captured along the other."
  - [corpus] Weak - no neighbor papers explicitly discuss spatially aware attention for sarcasm; claim based on general computer vision attention literature.
- Break condition: When sarcasm depends on global scene understanding rather than localized features, or when the attention module over-prunes relevant but non-salient regions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-level cross-domain semantic incongruity representation captures sarcasm by modeling text-image and text-caption mismatches at different semantic granularities.
- Mechanism: The model uses multi-head self-attention to compute text-image incongruity at the feature level, and co-attention to compute text-caption incongruity at the semantic level, then fuses both representations for final classification.
- Core assumption: Sarcasm arises from semantic mismatches at both low-level feature representations (text vs. raw image) and high-level semantic descriptions (text vs. generated captions), and modeling both levels improves detection accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multi-level cross-domain semantic incongruity representation achieved through feature fusion"
  - [section 3.5.1] "multi-head self-attention layer... captures the incongruity between the textual and visual data in two distinct manners, operating at separate levels"
  - [section 3.5.2] "co-attention mechanism... effectively address the disparities between the original text and the generated image captions"
  - [corpus] Moderate - neighbor papers like GDCNet and InterCLIP-MEP also model cross-modal incongruity, supporting the general approach.
- Break condition: When sarcasm does not involve semantic incongruity (e.g., purely tonal or contextual sarcasm) or when the caption generation fails to capture the relevant semantic aspects of the image.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: To identify and model semantic mismatches between text, image features, and captions, which are fundamental to sarcasm detection.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how multi-head self-attention differs from co-attention in the context of multimodal learning?

- Concept: Image captioning and vision-language models
  - Why needed here: To generate descriptive captions that capture deeper semantic meaning from images, providing an additional modality for detecting semantic incongruity with text.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the CLIP/ViT-L/14 encoder in the image-to-text transformer used for caption generation?

- Concept: Self-regulated convolutional networks
  - Why needed here: To extract robust regional image features with memory control, improving the quality of visual representations for incongruity modeling.
  - Quick check question: How does the regulator module in the self-regulated ConvNet differ from standard residual connections?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Textual feature extraction (cross-lingual LM) → Visual feature extraction (self-regulated ConvNet + spatial attention) → Caption generation (image-to-text transformer) → Incongruity modeling (multi-head attention + co-attention) → Fusion and classification (concatenation + softmax)
- Critical path: Text → Image features → Incongruity (text-image) → Caption features → Incongruity (text-caption) → Fusion → Prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Using image captions adds computational cost and dependency on caption quality, but provides richer semantic context; lightweight attention reduces computation but may miss complex spatial patterns; cross-lingual LM supports mixed languages but may not capture all cultural nuances.
- Failure signatures: Degraded accuracy on code-mixed text if cross-lingual embeddings misalign; poor sarcasm detection if captions miss key semantic details; overfitting to training modality distribution if fusion is not robust.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate the model on the Twitter dataset with and without the lightweight spatially aware attention module to measure its impact on accuracy.
  2. Replace the cross-lingual language model with a standard monolingual BERT to test the necessity of multilingual support for the MultiBully dataset.
  3. Remove the caption generation step and use only raw image features to evaluate the contribution of multi-level incongruity modeling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed architectural specifications for the self-regulated ConvNet and attention modules, limiting reproducibility.
- Performance on code-mixed text relies on general cross-lingual LM capabilities without specialized multilingual sarcasm detection comparison.
- The contribution of image captions versus raw image features is not isolated through controlled ablation experiments.

## Confidence

- Cross-lingual LM effectiveness for code-mixed text: Medium
- Lightweight spatially aware attention for visual features: Medium
- Multi-level incongruity modeling approach: High

## Next Checks
1. Ablate the lightweight spatially aware attention module and measure the change in sarcasm detection accuracy to quantify its contribution.
2. Compare the cross-lingual LM performance with a monolingual BERT on the MultiBully dataset to isolate the benefit of multilingual support.
3. Replace the image-to-text transformer caption generation with pre-trained CLIP-based image embeddings to assess the impact of multi-level incongruity modeling.
