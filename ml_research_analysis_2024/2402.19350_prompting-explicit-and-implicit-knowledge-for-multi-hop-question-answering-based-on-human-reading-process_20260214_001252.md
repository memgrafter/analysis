# Prompting Explicit and Implicit Knowledge for Multi-hop Question Answering Based on Human Reading Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.19350
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19350
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: PEI framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on HotpotQA with improved answer prediction and robust performance across datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Prompting Explicit and Implicit knowledge (PEI) framework for multi-hop question answering, inspired by human reading comprehension. The method uses prompts to connect explicit information from input passages with implicit knowledge acquired during pre-training, simulating the human cognitive process. PEI consists of three components: a type prompter to capture reasoning types, a knowledge prompter to elicit implicit knowledge iteratively using explicit information, and a unified prompter to integrate both knowledge types. Experiments on HotpotQA show PEI achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, with improvements in answer prediction while maintaining reasonable supporting fact accuracy.

## Method Summary
The PEI framework bridges explicit and implicit knowledge for multi-hop question answering through prompt-based learning. It employs three components: a type prompter using p-tuning v2 to capture reasoning types, a knowledge prompter using an iterative encoder-decoder approach to retrieve implicit knowledge from pre-trained models, and a unified prompter that integrates both explicit and implicit knowledge. The framework is pre-trained on single-hop QA tasks (SQuAD) and fine-tuned on multi-hop datasets (HotpotQA). The method uses AdamW optimizer with linear learning rate scheduler and demonstrates robust performance across different multi-hop QA datasets.

## Key Results
- PEI achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on HotpotQA
- The framework shows improvements in answer prediction (Ans F1) while maintaining supporting fact accuracy
- Ablation studies confirm that both implicit knowledge and type-specific reasoning enhance model performance
- PEI demonstrates robustness across different multi-hop datasets (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The PEI framework bridges explicit and implicit knowledge by using prompts to elicit implicit knowledge from pre-trained language models, reducing reliance on explicit information in passages.
- Mechanism: The framework employs a knowledge prompter that iteratively retrieves implicit knowledge through an encoder-decoder PLM, using explicit knowledge from input passages as prompts. This process mirrors human reading comprehension where prior knowledge reduces dependence on explicit text.
- Core assumption: Language models can effectively retrieve and utilize implicit knowledge acquired during pre-training when guided by explicit knowledge from input passages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "uses prompts to connect explicit and implicit knowledge, simulating the human cognitive process"
  - [section] "Our proposed PEI model demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics compared to all other baselines... highlighting the significant progress made by PEI for multi-hop QA"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations in corpus papers about this specific bridging mechanism
- Break condition: If the language model cannot effectively retrieve relevant implicit knowledge or if the explicit knowledge from passages is insufficient to guide the retrieval process.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating type-specific reasoning via prompts enhances the model's performance by capturing reasoning types for multi-hop questions.
- Mechanism: The type prompter identifies and learns weights for different reasoning types using p-tuning v2, which are then integrated with the unified prompter to provide type-specific reasoning capabilities.
- Core assumption: Different types of multi-hop questions require distinct reasoning approaches, and capturing these types improves overall performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our model incorporates type-specific reasoning via prompts, a form of implicit knowledge"
  - [section] "The language model combined with the type prompter achieves a substantial improvement of 3.02/1.17/2.18 in Ans/Sup/Joint F1 compared to the model without the type prompter component"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations in corpus papers about type-specific reasoning enhancement
- Break condition: If the type prompter fails to capture meaningful distinctions between reasoning types or if the learned weights do not improve performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-training on single-hop QA tasks improves the model's reasoning capabilities for multi-hop QA by establishing a foundation of basic comprehension skills.
- Mechanism: The framework uses an ELECTRA model pre-trained on SQuAD (single-hop) as the backbone for type prompter and unified prompter modules, leveraging this foundational knowledge for more complex reasoning tasks.
- Core assumption: Skills learned from single-hop QA tasks transfer to and enhance performance on multi-hop QA tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The language model combined with the pre-training improves 0.70/0.62/1.04 in Ans F1/Sup F1/Joint F1 compared to the model without the pre-training"
  - [section] "This indicates that pre-training in the single-hop QA task enable the model to acquire valuable information, enhancing its overall performance"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations in corpus papers about pre-training transfer effects
- Break condition: If the pre-training does not provide meaningful transfer benefits or if the single-hop skills are not applicable to multi-hop reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt-based learning and p-tuning
  - Why needed here: The PEI framework relies heavily on prompt-based methods to connect explicit and implicit knowledge, requiring understanding of how to effectively design and implement prompts.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between prefix tuning and p-tuning v2, and when would you use each?

- Concept: Multi-hop question answering
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is designed for multi-hop QA tasks, requiring understanding of the challenges and approaches specific to this domain.
  - Quick check question: How does multi-hop QA differ from single-hop QA in terms of required reasoning and information integration?

- Concept: Encoder-decoder architectures and iterative reasoning
  - Why needed here: The knowledge prompter uses an iterative encoder-decoder approach to retrieve implicit knowledge, requiring understanding of how to implement and optimize such architectures.
  - Quick check question: How does the iterative approach in the knowledge prompter differ from a single-pass approach, and what are the benefits?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input passages -> Knowledge prompter (iterative implicit knowledge retrieval) -> Unified prompter (integration with type-specific reasoning) -> Final answer prediction
- Critical path: The critical path for inference is: input passages → knowledge prompter (iterative implicit knowledge retrieval) → unified prompter (integration with type-specific reasoning) → final answer prediction.
- Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity for improved performance by using iterative implicit knowledge retrieval and multiple prompt-based components. This increases model complexity but provides better reasoning capabilities.
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include: insufficient implicit knowledge retrieval leading to poor performance, type prompter failing to capture meaningful reasoning distinctions, and integration issues between components leading to inconsistent predictions.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and test the knowledge prompter component in isolation to verify implicit knowledge retrieval capabilities.
  2. Evaluate the type prompter's ability to capture different reasoning types and their impact on performance.
  3. Test the full PEI framework on a small subset of HotpotQA to verify integration and overall performance improvements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense, but based on the limitations section and discussion, several areas remain unexplored:

1. How does PEI's implicit knowledge mechanism compare to other methods of incorporating pre-training knowledge in multi-hop QA?
2. What is the nature and content of the implicit knowledge that PEI elicits from PLMs?
3. How does PEI's performance scale with more complex multi-hop reasoning tasks beyond the current datasets?
4. What is the computational efficiency trade-off between PEI and other multi-hop QA approaches?

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on prompt engineering introduces significant variability in performance, as effectiveness depends heavily on prompt template quality
- The iterative knowledge retrieval process in the knowledge prompter component lacks clear stopping criteria, potentially leading to computational inefficiency
- While ablation studies show benefits from both implicit knowledge and type-specific reasoning, the relative contribution of each component to overall performance remains unclear

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core methodology: The framework's approach of bridging explicit and implicit knowledge through prompts is well-grounded in human cognitive processes and supported by experimental results
- **Medium confidence** in the generalizability: The framework shows good performance on HotpotQA and robustness across different datasets, but may require adaptation for domains with different knowledge structures
- **Low confidence** in the scalability: The iterative implicit knowledge retrieval process may not scale efficiently to longer documents or more complex reasoning chains

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain validation by testing PEI on non-Wikipedia datasets to assess generalization capabilities and identify domain-specific prompt engineering requirements
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of the iterative knowledge retrieval process, specifically measuring computational overhead versus performance gains at different iteration counts
3. Implement a comparative analysis between PEI and traditional retrieval-augmented approaches to quantify the benefits of implicit knowledge elicitation versus explicit document retrieval
