# RLGNet: Repeating-Local-Global History Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.00586
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00586
- Authors: Ao Lv; Guige Ouyang; Yongzhong Huang; Yue Chen; Haoran Xie
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six TKG datasets with up to 3.42% MRR improvement on GDELT

## Executive Summary
RLGNet introduces an ensemble learning approach for temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning that processes historical information at multiple scales. The method combines three independently trained modules - Repeating, Local, and Global History - each capturing different aspects of temporal patterns. By using hybrid RNN and MLP architectures for local and global processing respectively, the model achieves complementary performance for both single-step and multi-step reasoning tasks. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
RLGNet is an ensemble learning-based model for TKG reasoning that processes historical information through three independent modules: Repeating History Module (identifies recurring patterns), Local History Module (captures short-term changes using RNN-based GCN), and Global History Module (provides macro perspective using MLP-based processing). The model trains each module independently on six benchmark TKG datasets, then combines their predictions through weighted ensemble learning. Numerical embeddings convert temporal and frequency information into embeddings using cosine and tanh functions. The hybrid architecture leverages RNN strengths for temporal dependencies and MLP advantages for pattern generalization across the entire dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 3.42% MRR improvement on GDELT dataset compared to existing models
- Demonstrates 2.11% MRR improvement on ICEWS14 dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all six benchmark TKG datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ensemble learning strategy reduces sensitivity to noise in TKGs by combining predictions from three independently trained modules.
- Mechanism: Each module captures different aspects of historical information (repeating, local, global) and learns independently, preventing overfitting to noise patterns. The final prediction aggregates these diverse perspectives.
- Core assumption: Historical information in TKGs can be decomposed into repeating, local, and global components that capture complementary patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To address the issue of noise in TKGs, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy, combining the predictions of the three modules to reduce the impact of noise on the final prediction results."
  - [section] "Due to the advantages of RNN-based and MLP-based models in single-step and multi-step reasoning tasks, as well as their effectiveness in handling historical information at different scales, RLGNet adopts an RNN-based structure for the Local History Module and an MLP-based structure for the Global History Module."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on different architectures but don't specifically address ensemble learning for noise reduction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hybrid architecture (RNN + MLP) provides complementary capabilities for single-step and multi-step reasoning tasks.
- Mechanism: RNN-based Local History Module excels at capturing short-term changes and recent patterns, while MLP-based Global History Module better generalizes long-term trends without temporal bias. Their combination enables both task types.
- Core assumption: RNN and MLP architectures have complementary strengths that can be leveraged for different reasoning temporal scales.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we adopted architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for the Local and Global History Modules, respectively. This hybrid architecture design enables the model to complement both multi-step and single-step reasoning capabilities."
  - [section] "MLP-based models are well-suited for capturing patterns and relationships across the entire dataset because they process each input independently, without temporal bias, allowing them to generalize long-term trends and patterns. On the other hand, RNN-based models are ideal for capturing local historical information, as they excel at handling short sequences of data and can effectively capture short-term changes in the most recent time steps."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers mention different architectures but don't specifically analyze complementary strengths.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-scale historical information processing captures both repetitive patterns and evolving trends for more accurate predictions.
- Mechanism: The Repeating History Module identifies and reinforces patterns that recur over time, the Local History Module captures short-term changes and details, and the Global History Module provides macro perspective on long-term changes. This multi-scale approach addresses both predictable patterns and evolving dynamics.
- Core assumption: TKG facts exhibit both repetitive patterns and evolving trends that can be captured at different historical scales.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Specifically, RLGNet captures and integrates different levels of historical information by combining modules that process information at various scales."
  - [section] "The Repeating History Module focuses on identifying repetitive patterns and trends in historical data, the Local History Module captures short-term changes and details, and the Global History Module provides a macro perspective on long-term changes."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss different historical perspectives but don't specifically address multi-scale decomposition.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) structure and reasoning tasks
  - Why needed here: Understanding TKG quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp) and the distinction between single-step and multi-step reasoning is fundamental to grasping the problem RLGNet addresses.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between single-step and multi-step reasoning in TKGs?

- Concept: Ensemble learning and hybrid architectures
  - Why needed here: The paper's core innovation relies on combining multiple independent modules and using different neural architectures (RNN vs MLP) to capture complementary information.
  - Quick check question: How does ensemble learning help reduce overfitting to noise in temporal data?

- Concept: GCN and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The Local History Module uses GCN to aggregate structural information and attention to integrate candidate entities, which are key components of the model's local information capture.
  - Quick check question: What role does the attention mechanism play in aggregating candidate entities for local history processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Repeating History Module -> Local History Module (GCN + attention) -> Global History Module (MLP) -> Ensemble Layer (weighted sum)
- Critical path: For each query, extract candidate entities → process through all three modules → combine predictions → rank and return results
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Independent module training vs. joint training: Independence reduces noise sensitivity but loses parameter sharing benefits
  - RNN vs MLP for local/global: RNN captures temporal dependencies better but may struggle with long sequences; MLP generalizes better but lacks temporal modeling
  - Ensemble weighting (α): Requires hyperparameter tuning but enables balancing local vs global importance
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on repetitive patterns: Repeating module may not be capturing frequency information correctly
  - Weak single-step reasoning: Local module may not be properly capturing recent temporal dynamics
  - Poor multi-step reasoning: Global module may not be generalizing long-term trends effectively
  - Overfitting: Ensemble strategy may not be sufficiently reducing noise sensitivity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test each module independently on a small dataset to verify they capture their intended scale of information
  2. Validate the numerical embedding converts temporal information effectively by checking embedding patterns
  3. Experiment with different α values on validation set to find optimal ensemble weighting for the target dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the ensemble learning strategy perform compared to other ensemble methods like stacking or boosting in TKG reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the ensemble learning strategy used in RLGNet reduces sensitivity to noisy data and improves performance compared to joint learning, but doesn't compare against other ensemble methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares ensemble learning to joint learning, not other ensemble methods like stacking or boosting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing RLGNet's ensemble strategy to stacking or boosting approaches on the same benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would RLGNet perform on TKGs with continuous time representations rather than discrete timestamp snapshots?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes discrete timestamp snapshots for TKG reasoning, but real-world temporal knowledge graphs often have continuous time information.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture and evaluation are designed for discrete time, and continuous time representation would require architectural modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Adaptation of RLGNet to handle continuous time and performance comparison on datasets with continuous timestamps.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different attention mechanisms (like multi-head attention) on the performance of RLGNet's Local and Global History Modules?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a single attention mechanism in both Local and Global modules, but doesn't explore alternative attention architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the overall architecture but doesn't systematically investigate different attention mechanisms within the modules.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments replacing the current attention mechanism with alternatives like multi-head attention across all benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does RLGNet scale to very large TKGs with millions of entities and relations in terms of computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper doesn't report computational complexity or runtime performance, though it mentions computational resource considerations for candidate entity selection.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on accuracy metrics but doesn't analyze computational efficiency or scalability to larger datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Runtime analysis and memory usage measurements on datasets of varying sizes, including very large-scale TKGs.

## Limitations
- Ensemble learning claims lack rigorous ablation studies to quantify specific contributions to performance gains
- Multi-scale decomposition assumption remains untested - no analysis of whether TKG facts actually exhibit claimed repetitive patterns
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (particularly ensemble weighting α) not thoroughly explored across different dataset characteristics

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The hybrid architecture design (RNN + MLP) providing complementary single-step and multi-step reasoning capabilities. This is well-supported by established literature on RNN and MLP strengths.
- **Medium Confidence**: The ensemble learning strategy reducing noise sensitivity. While intuitively sound, the specific implementation details and their effectiveness against noise need more empirical validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The multi-scale historical information processing claims. The decomposition into repeating, local, and global components is presented as a design choice rather than empirically validated pattern discovery.

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies comparing RLGNet against simpler ensemble baselines (e.g., average ensemble of RNN and MLP models) to quantify the actual contribution of the multi-module design.

2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the ensemble weighting parameter α across all six datasets to determine if optimal weights vary significantly by dataset characteristics.

3. Design experiments to test whether TKG facts in the benchmark datasets actually exhibit the claimed repetitive patterns by comparing the Repeating module's performance against a random pattern detection baseline.
