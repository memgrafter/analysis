# Language is Scary when Over-Analyzed: Unpacking Implied Misogynistic Reasoning with Argumentation Theory-Driven Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.02519
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02519
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: LLMs struggle with implicit misogyny detection, relying on stereotypes rather than inductive reasoning when generating missing warrants between claims and evidence.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates large language models' (LLMs) ability to detect implicit misogyny by reconstructing the underlying reasoning links in hateful messages. Using Toulmin's Argumentation Theory, the authors frame implicit misogyny detection as an argumentative reasoning task, focusing on generating the missing warrant between a message and its implied misogynistic meanings. Experiments with Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B-v02 on English and Italian datasets show that LLMs struggle with this task, relying more on implicit stereotypes than on inductive reasoning. Manual validation reveals that only 35-50% of generated warrants lead to correct classifications, with performance varying significantly between languages.

## Method Summary
The study uses argumentation theory as a foundation to develop prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Two datasets are used: ImplicIT-Mis (1,120 Italian Facebook comments) and SBIC+ (2,409 English messages). LLMs (Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B-v02) are prompted to generate either Toulmin-style warrants or implied assumptions. Performance is evaluated using Recall for classification, BERTScore and BLEU for generation quality, and manual validation on 300 messages. The method explicitly frames implicit misogyny detection as argumentative reasoning rather than pattern matching.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve only 35-50% accuracy in generating valid implied assumptions that lead to correct classifications
- Few-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot prompting for LLM reasoning tasks
- Italian data shows significantly lower performance than English data (25% vs 60% recall in zero-shot settings)
- Llama3-8B refuses to answer more frequently due to over-safety moderation, while Mistral-7B-v02 provides more indecisive responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs fail to detect implicit misogyny because they rely on internalized stereotypes rather than inductive reasoning.
- Mechanism: When LLMs process implicit misogynistic messages, they generate implied assumptions based on their training data's common stereotypes about women rather than analyzing the specific reasoning behind the message.
- Core assumption: The model's knowledge base contains more stereotypical associations than nuanced understanding of implicit misogyny.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs fall short on reasoning capabilities about misogynistic comments and that they mostly rely on their implicit knowledge derived from internalized common stereotypes about women to generate implied assumptions, rather than on inductive reasoning."
  - [section 6.3] "Wrong Inference This is the largest class of errors in both languages. We observe that wrong inferences are mainly driven by spurious correlations and the activation of implicit knowledge."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Framing implicit misogyny detection as an argumentative reasoning task improves detection by forcing explicit warrant generation.
- Mechanism: By requiring models to generate the missing warrant between a claim and evidence, the detection task becomes more structured and less reliant on surface-level pattern matching.
- Core assumption: Explicit warrant generation forces the model to engage with the underlying reasoning rather than just surface features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our study uses argumentation theory as a foundation to form a collection of prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot settings."
  - [section 3] "Grounded on previous work on AR in user-generated content (Boltuži ´c and Šnajder, 2016; Becker et al., 2020), we frame implicit misogyny detection as an AR task (Habernal et al., 2018a) based on the Toulmin’s theory (Toulmin et al., 1979)"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Manual validation reveals a disconnect between correct explanations and correct classifications, indicating LLMs don't truly understand the reasoning.
- Mechanism: Even when LLMs generate valid implied assumptions, these don't consistently lead to correct classification decisions, suggesting the reasoning process is superficial.
- Core assumption: The generation of valid implicit assumptions is separate from the classification decision-making process in LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.3] "For SBIC+, the percentage of valid implied assumptions leading to a correct classification is 50%, while correct implied assumptions leading to a wrong classification are 52%."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Argumentation Theory and Toulmin's model
  - Why needed here: The study frames implicit misogyny detection as an argumentative reasoning task, requiring understanding of how claims, warrants, and reasoning components work together.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a claim, warrant, and backing in Toulmin's argumentation model?

- Concept: Implicit vs. explicit content in hate speech
  - Why needed here: The study focuses specifically on implicit misogyny, which requires different detection approaches than explicit hate speech.
  - Quick check question: What makes implicit hate speech more challenging to detect than explicit hate speech?

- Concept: Prompt engineering techniques (Chain-of-Thought, Knowledge Augmentation)
  - Why needed here: The study uses various prompting strategies to improve LLM performance on implicit reasoning tasks.
  - Quick check question: How do Chain-of-Thought prompting and Knowledge Augmentation differ in their approach to improving LLM reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Message input -> Prompt selection (Toulmin vs. implied assumption) -> LLM inference -> Classification output -> Evaluation (automatic/manual) -> Analysis of reasoning quality
- Critical path: Message input → Prompt selection (Toulmin vs. implied assumption) → LLM inference → Classification output → Evaluation (automatic/manual) → Analysis of reasoning quality
- Design tradeoffs: The choice between Toulmin's warrant-based prompts and implied assumption prompts represents a tradeoff between structured reasoning and broader interpretation. The study also trades off between zero-shot and few-shot settings, with few-shot generally performing better but requiring more training data.
- Failure signatures: High refusal rates from Llama3-8B indicate over-safety moderation, while indecisive answers from Mistral-7B-v02 suggest uncertainty in handling implicit content. Poor performance on Italian data compared to English indicates language-specific challenges with implicit reasoning.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare zero-shot performance of Llama3-8B vs. Mistral-7B-v02 on English SBIC+ data using Toulmin warrant prompts
  2. Test few-shot performance on Italian ImplicIT-Mis data using both Toulmin and implied assumption prompt variants
  3. Evaluate the correlation between automatically generated explanations and manual validation results on a 300-message subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do reasoning capabilities for implicit misogyny detection vary across different languages beyond English and Italian?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests English and Italian datasets but notes the need for cross-linguistic exploration
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to two languages; cultural and linguistic differences in implicit misogyny expression may affect model performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the same argumentative reasoning approach on datasets in multiple other languages with varying degrees of directness and cultural context

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between human-in-the-loop verification and automated generation of implied assumptions/warrants for practical deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that integrating all generated knowledge without evaluation is a limitation and suggest human verification
- Why unresolved: The paper does not empirically test different levels of human involvement in the verification process
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring efficiency and accuracy trade-offs with varying degrees of human oversight in warrant generation

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do safeguard mechanisms in LLMs impact the detection of implicit misogyny across different model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that Llama3-8B's safeguard layer causes refusal to answer, affecting results
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares two models with different safeguard implementations
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of multiple LLMs with varying safeguard mechanisms on the same implicit misogyny detection tasks

## Limitations

- The study only tests two languages (English and Italian), limiting generalizability to other linguistic and cultural contexts
- Manual validation was performed on only 300 messages across both languages, which may not capture all reasoning failure modes
- The study doesn't explore whether fine-tuning LLMs on explicit implicit misogyny examples could improve their reasoning capabilities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that LLMs struggle with implicit misogyny detection through argumentative reasoning is well-supported by multiple evaluation methods (automatic metrics + manual validation). The observation that models rely more on stereotypes than inductive reasoning is consistently observed across languages and prompt types.
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance differences between Toulmin warrant prompts and implied assumption prompts are statistically observable but the practical significance varies by language. The superiority of few-shot over zero-shot prompting is consistent but the margin is modest.
- **Low Confidence**: The exact mechanisms behind language-specific performance differences and the relative contributions of translation quality versus cultural context to these differences remain unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the exact same Italian messages translated to English (and vice versa) with the same LLMs to isolate language-specific vs. content-specific effects on reasoning performance.
2. **Stereotype pattern analysis**: Conduct a systematic analysis of the stereotypical associations that LLMs activate when generating implied assumptions, comparing these to human-annotated implicit assumptions to quantify the reasoning gap.
3. **Reasoning chain augmentation**: Implement and test prompt strategies that explicitly force reasoning chains (e.g., "explain step-by-step why this message implies misogyny") to determine if structured reasoning prompts can overcome the stereotype-based limitations observed.
