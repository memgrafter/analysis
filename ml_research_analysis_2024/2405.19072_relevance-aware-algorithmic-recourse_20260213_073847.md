# Relevance-aware Algorithmic Recourse

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19072
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: RAAR achieves comparable performance to traditional approaches with greater efficiency and lower relative costs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Relevance-Aware Algorithmic Recourse (RAAR), a framework that incorporates domain relevance into counterfactual explanations for regression tasks. The key innovation is using relevance functions—either distribution-based or target-specific—to guide Bayesian optimization in finding actionable recourses that are both effective and realistic. The approach addresses the gap between theoretical optimality and practical feasibility in algorithmic recourse by prioritizing changes that are more likely to be implemented in real-world scenarios.

Experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that RAAR achieves results comparable to traditional y-optimized approaches but with greater efficiency: it finds recourses with lower relative costs and in fewer iterations. In target optimization tasks, RAAR consistently outperformed baseline methods, particularly when optimizing for specific target values. The study shows that relevance-aware optimization can produce actionable and cost-effective recourses, offering a promising direction for future research in algorithmic recourse.

## Method Summary
RAAR employs Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process surrogate models and Upper Confidence Bound acquisition functions to efficiently search for counterfactual explanations. The framework uses relevance functions that assign higher importance to extreme, rarer outcomes and lower importance to common, near-origin values. These relevance functions are either automatically generated based on data distribution or manually defined for specific target values. The optimization process is guided by these relevance functions, which act as pseudo-bounds to steer the search toward more realistic and actionable changes while maintaining effectiveness.

## Key Results
- RAAR achieves comparable performance to traditional y-optimized approaches across 15 datasets
- Generated recourses have lower relative costs and require fewer optimization iterations
- In target optimization tasks, RAAR consistently outperforms baselines, especially for specific target values
- Relevance-aware optimization produces actionable and cost-effective recourses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RAAR's relevance-aware optimization reduces search space and computational cost by biasing Bayesian optimization toward realistic counterfactuals.
- Mechanism: By incorporating a relevance function that assigns higher importance to extreme, rarer outcomes and lower importance to common values, RAAR steers optimization toward effective and realistic recourses. The relevance function pseudo-bounds the optimization, guiding the acquisition function to explore regions more likely to yield actionable changes.
- Core assumption: The relevance function accurately reflects real-world user preferences and practical feasibility.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] shows comparable results with greater efficiency; [section] demonstrates smaller cost and y percent change; [corpus] provides weak evidence for mechanism-specific claims.
- Break condition: Poorly constructed relevance functions that don't represent user preferences may produce ineffective or unrealistic recourses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RAAR's local relevance functions for target optimization enable more precise and efficient targeting of specific outcome values.
- Mechanism: Unique relevance functions for each target value prioritize the target by setting control points, making optimization more focused and efficient. The relevance function is defined with control points that emphasize the target value.
- Core assumption: Target-specific relevance functions accurately reflect the importance of reaching specific outcome values.
- Evidence anchors: [section] shows control point definitions; [section] explains the need for specific outcome targeting; [corpus] provides weak evidence.
- Break condition: Improperly defined target-specific relevance functions may fail to find effective recourses for target optimization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RAAR's use of Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes and acquisition functions enables efficient exploration and exploitation of the feature space.
- Mechanism: Bayesian optimization uses a Gaussian process surrogate model to predict the objective function and an acquisition function (Upper Confidence Bound) to balance exploration and exploitation, efficiently searching for optimal recourses.
- Core assumption: The Gaussian process surrogate model and acquisition function are appropriate for the problem and accurately model the objective function.
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes the Bayesian optimization components; [section] outlines the three primary components; [corpus] provides weak evidence.
- Break condition: Inappropriate Gaussian process or acquisition function may fail to find effective recourses or require excessive computational resources.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Relevance and its role in algorithmic recourse
  - Why needed here: Understanding how relevance affects the optimization process and the generation of actionable recourses is crucial for implementing RAAR effectively.
  - Quick check question: How does the relevance function influence the search for counterfactual explanations in RAAR?

- Concept: Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes
  - Why needed here: RAAR relies on Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes to efficiently search for optimal recourses, so a solid understanding of these concepts is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the Gaussian process surrogate model contribute to the efficiency of Bayesian optimization in RAAR?

- Concept: Objective functions and their optimization
  - Why needed here: RAAR uses different objective functions for y optimization and relevance optimization, so understanding how these functions are defined and optimized is critical for implementing the framework.
  - Quick check question: How do the objective functions for y optimization and relevance optimization differ in RAAR?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input dataset, predictive model, relevance function(s) -> Bayesian optimization engine, Gaussian process surrogate model, acquisition function (UCB) -> Counterfactual explanations (recourses) -> Relevance function generator, objective function definer

- Critical path: 1. Define relevance function(s) based on dataset and optimization goals 2. Set up Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process surrogate model and acquisition function 3. Optimize objective function(s) using Bayesian optimization 4. Generate counterfactual explanations based on optimization results

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Relevance function complexity vs. computational efficiency: More complex relevance functions may lead to more accurate recourses but may also increase computational cost.
  - Exploration vs. exploitation in Bayesian optimization: Balancing the exploration of new regions in the feature space with the exploitation of known good regions is crucial for finding optimal recourses efficiently.
  - Y optimization vs. relevance optimization: Depending on the specific use case, it may be more important to focus on maximizing the outcome (y optimization) or on finding more realistic and actionable recourses (relevance optimization).

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to find effective recourses: This may indicate issues with the relevance function, the objective function, or the Bayesian optimization process.
  - Excessive computational time: This may suggest that the relevance function is too complex or that the Bayesian optimization process is not well-tuned.
  - Unrealistic or impractical recourses: This may indicate that the relevance function does not accurately reflect real-world user preferences or practical feasibility.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test RAAR on a simple dataset with a well-defined relevance function to verify that it can find effective recourses efficiently.
  2. Compare the performance of RAAR with and without relevance optimization on a more complex dataset to quantify the benefits of incorporating relevance.
  3. Evaluate the impact of different relevance function shapes and control point configurations on the quality and efficiency of the generated recourses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How do different shapes of the relevance function affect the accuracy and precision of algorithmic recourses?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future development could explore "how different shapes of a relevance function can improve the accuracy and precision of such recourses."
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the impact of varying the shape of the relevance function on the performance of algorithmic recourses.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing algorithmic recourses generated with different shapes of relevance functions, measuring their accuracy and precision.

- Question: How do different mean, covariance, and acquisition functions influence the quality of algorithmic recourses?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests exploring "how different mean covariance and acquisition functions influence recourse."
  - Why unresolved: The study uses a specific combination of mean, covariance, and acquisition functions (Matern kernel and Upper Confidence Bound) but does not explore alternatives.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different combinations of mean, covariance, and acquisition functions to generate algorithmic recourses, evaluating their quality.

- Question: How effective is RAAR when combined with other approaches to algorithmic recourse, such as integer programming?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes using "relevance-focused recourses with other approaches to recourse mentioned earlier, such as integer programming."
  - Why unresolved: The study focuses solely on Bayesian optimization and does not explore the integration of RAAR with other recourse methods.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the performance of RAAR when combined with integer programming or other recourse approaches, compared to using them independently.

## Limitations

- The evidence for mechanism-specific claims remains weak, with only abstract-level support for how relevance functions actually improve optimization efficiency.
- The study uses a specific combination of mean, covariance, and acquisition functions but does not explore alternatives.
- The practical interpretability of relevance functions for end-users is not evaluated.

## Confidence

- High confidence in comparative performance results (y-optimized vs relevance-optimized)
- Medium confidence in efficiency gains (lower relative costs, fewer iterations)
- Low confidence in mechanism-level explanations of why relevance-aware optimization works

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments on at least 5 additional diverse regression datasets to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing RAAR with different relevance function shapes to isolate their impact on performance
3. Implement user studies to evaluate whether the generated recourses align with human notions of "actionability" and "realism"
