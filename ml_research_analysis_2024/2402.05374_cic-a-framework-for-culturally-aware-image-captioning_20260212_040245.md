# CIC: A Framework for Culturally-Aware Image Captioning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05374
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05374
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: 45 participants rated CIC's culturally-aware captions significantly higher than baseline models across four cultural groups

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CIC, a framework that generates culturally-aware image captions by extracting cultural visual elements through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and incorporating them into captions via large language models. The method addresses the limitation of vision-language models that typically miss cultural visual elements in standard captioning. Human evaluation across four cultural groups (West, East Asia, South Asia, Africa) demonstrated that CIC generated captions with significantly higher cultural descriptive quality compared to baseline models, achieving scores of 62%, 55%, 44%, and 43% respectively.

## Method Summary
The CIC framework works by first generating cultural questions based on five categories (architecture, clothing, food & drink, dance & music, religion), then using BLIP2's VQA to extract cultural visual elements from images. These VQA results, along with standard captions, are used to construct prompts for ChatGPT, which generates culturally-aware captions. The framework employs human evaluation by participants from the relevant cultural groups to assess caption quality, using metrics including cultural descriptive quality, CLIPScore, and Culture Noise Rate.

## Key Results
- CIC achieved significantly higher cultural descriptive quality scores than baseline models (GIT, CoCa, BLIP2) across all four cultural groups
- Culture Noise Rate (CNR) was 17% higher for CIC compared to baselines, indicating more cultural elements in captions
- Human evaluation involved 45 participants from four cultural groups rating captions on cultural descriptive quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VQA with culturally relevant questions extracts visual cultural elements that VLPs miss in captions
- Mechanism: The framework generates questions based on five cultural categories, clusters similar questions to avoid redundancy, and uses BLIP2's VQA to answer these questions. This extracts cultural visual elements that are incorporated into captions through LLM prompting.
- Core assumption: Images contain visual elements corresponding to the defined cultural categories, and VQA can accurately identify these elements when prompted with culturally relevant questions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts."
- Break condition: If images lack the defined cultural visual elements or if VQA fails to identify them accurately, the framework cannot extract meaningful cultural information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt engineering with VQA results enables LLMs to generate culturally-aware captions without hallucinations
- Mechanism: The framework constructs prompts combining instruction text, caption prompts, and VQA results. The instruction directs the LLM to incorporate VQA information without simply appending it, while the caption prompt provides context about object interactions.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively integrate structured visual information (VQA results) with language generation when properly prompted.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "We construct a prompt for LLM to generate captions by concatenating the instruction, caption prompt, and VQA results."
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot properly integrate the VQA results or if the prompt structure is ineffective, the generated captions may be incoherent or fail to incorporate cultural elements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human evaluation by cultural representatives validates cultural awareness better than automated metrics
- Mechanism: The framework employs 45 participants from four cultural groups who rate captions based on cultural descriptive quality. This subjective evaluation captures nuances that automated metrics cannot fully measure.
- Core assumption: Individuals from specific cultural groups can accurately assess whether captions capture culturally relevant details.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Human evaluation on 45 participants from four cultural groups showed that CIC generated captions with significantly higher cultural descriptive quality compared to baseline models"
- Break condition: If participants lack sufficient cultural understanding or if there's significant bias in their evaluations, the human assessment may not accurately reflect cultural awareness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding VLPs like BLIP2 is essential as they form the foundation for image captioning and VQA components of the framework
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of VLPs in generating culturally-aware captions, and how does the CIC framework address these limitations?

- Concept: Visual Question Answering (VQA)
  - Why needed here: VQA is the mechanism through which cultural visual elements are extracted from images, making it central to the framework's functionality
  - Quick check question: How does the framework use VQA to extract cultural visual elements, and why is this approach more effective than relying solely on image captions?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering for LLMs
  - Why needed here: The framework's success depends on effective prompt construction to guide LLMs in generating culturally-aware captions using VQA results
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the prompt used in the CIC framework, and how do they work together to generate culturally-aware captions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BLIP2 (for image captioning and VQA) → Question Generation and Clustering → VQA with Cultural Questions → Cultural Element Extraction → Prompt Construction → ChatGPT (for caption generation) → Human Evaluation

- Critical path: Image → BLIP2 Caption/VQA → Question Generation → VQA → Cultural Element Extraction → Prompt Construction → ChatGPT → Culturally-aware Caption

- Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational efficiency for cultural awareness by adding multiple processing steps (question generation, VQA, prompt construction). This increases latency but improves cultural descriptive quality.

- Failure signatures: Low Culture Noise Rate (CNR), poor performance in human evaluations, VQA failing to identify cultural elements, or LLM generating hallucinations when incorporating VQA results.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test VQA with a small set of manually crafted cultural questions on diverse images to verify cultural element extraction
  2. Validate prompt construction by testing with ChatGPT using known VQA results to ensure coherent caption generation
  3. Conduct a small-scale human evaluation with participants from one cultural group to validate the framework's effectiveness before full deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the CIC framework perform when applied to non-cultural domains such as artworks or fashion, and what modifications would be needed to optimize its performance in these contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The conclusion mentions the potential application of the framework in non-cultural domains like artworks and fashion.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on cultural image captioning and does not provide empirical evidence or analysis of the framework's performance in other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments applying the CIC framework to image captioning tasks in artworks and fashion domains, and comparing the results with baseline models to evaluate performance and identify necessary modifications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific biases present in the CLIP model used for CLIPScore evaluation, and how do these biases affect the assessment of cultural elements in image captions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that CLIPScore relies on the CLIP model, which has biases.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the existence of biases in CLIP but does not detail their nature or impact on cultural evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the biases in CLIP, focusing on how they influence the evaluation of cultural elements, and developing alternative metrics or adjustments to mitigate these biases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the CIC framework be improved to capture cultural elements in modern images, where traditional cultural markers are less distinct or absent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of the framework in handling modern cultural images and the difficulty in distinguishing cultural elements.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the limitation but does not propose solutions or improvements for handling modern cultural images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research and development of additional cultural elements or features specific to modern contexts, such as race, modern city style, or other contemporary cultural indicators, and testing their integration into the CIC framework.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on BLIP2's VQA accuracy, which may vary across different cultural contexts and visual domains
- Human evaluation involved a relatively small sample size (45 participants) that may not fully represent the diversity within each cultural group
- The Culture Noise Rate metric measures quantity rather than quality of cultural elements, potentially rewarding superficial cultural references

## Confidence

- High confidence: The framework's core mechanism of using VQA with culturally relevant questions to extract visual elements, combined with LLM prompting, is well-supported by the evidence
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the prompt engineering approach and the claim that it prevents hallucinations are reasonably supported but would benefit from more detailed analysis
- Low confidence: The generalizability of the framework to cultural categories beyond the five defined ones, and its performance on images with subtle or mixed cultural elements, remains uncertain

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the VQA component to quantify its specific contribution to cultural awareness, and test the framework's performance on images with minimal obvious cultural markers

2. Expand human evaluation to include participants from additional cultural subgroups and conduct inter-rater reliability analysis to validate consistency of cultural assessments

3. Test the framework's performance on out-of-distribution images and cultural contexts not represented in the GD-VCR dataset to assess generalizability
