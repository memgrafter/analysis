# Automated Real-World Sustainability Data Generation from Images of Buildings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.18064
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18064
- Reference count: 0
- One-line result: Automated method achieves better accuracy than humans for building sustainability assessment from images

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of assessing building sustainability when detailed data is unavailable by automatically generating sustainability-related features from images. The method uses GPT-4o with domain-specific prompts and knowledge rules to estimate building features like age, heating type, window type, and lighting efficiency. Evaluated on 47 real apartments, the approach achieves better accuracy than an experienced human expert, demonstrating the feasibility of scalable, image-based building sustainability assessment.

## Method Summary
The method uses GPT-4o to analyze building images through a multi-step process. First, specific images are selected for each sustainability feature category. Then, GPT-4o processes these images using specialized prompts designed for different features (age, heating, windows, lighting). Domain knowledge rules translate the LLM's observations into standardized sustainability metrics. The approach breaks the task into multiple specialized prompts with chain-of-thought reasoning to improve accuracy. Results are compared against ground truth data and human expert assessments.

## Key Results
- Building age estimation error: 4.47 years
- Heating type prediction accuracy: 76.6% correct
- Window type identification: 95.6% correct or approximate
- Lighting efficiency estimation: RMSE of 27.8%
- Energy consumption estimation: average difference of 42.66 kwh/m2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The combination of domain-specific knowledge rules with image-to-text conversion from GPT-4o allows accurate identification of building features despite LLM limitations. GPT-4o performs visual feature identification (e.g., detecting radiators, windows, lighting types) while the rule base translates these observations into standardized sustainability features like heating type and energy source.

### Mechanism 2
Breaking the task into multiple specialized prompts with chain-of-thought reasoning improves accuracy by preventing the LLM from making premature conclusions. The algorithm uses separate prompts for building age, type, heating, windows, and lighting, each with targeted questions and required explanations before answers.

### Mechanism 3
Image selection based on feature relevance enables the model to focus on diagnostic visual cues rather than general building appearance. For each sustainability feature (age, heating, windows, etc.), specific image categories are selected that are most likely to contain relevant diagnostic information.

## Foundational Learning

- **Visual feature extraction and pattern recognition**
  - Why needed: The system relies on GPT-4o's ability to identify specific architectural elements from images
  - Quick check: Can GPT-4o reliably distinguish between single-glazed and double-glazed windows in diverse lighting conditions?

- **Prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning**
  - Why needed: The model requires structured prompts that guide it through specific identification tasks before making conclusions
  - Quick check: Does breaking the task into separate prompts with required explanations improve accuracy compared to a single comprehensive prompt?

- **Domain knowledge rule systems**
  - Why needed: Raw image observations must be translated into standardized sustainability metrics using logical rules
  - Quick check: Can a simple rule base accurately convert heating system observations into standardized energy source classifications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Image preprocessing → Prompt engineering module → GPT-4o API interface → Rule base engine → Output formatting
- **Critical path**: Image selection → Feature identification prompts → Rule-based classification → Result aggregation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher accuracy through multiple specialized prompts vs. increased API costs and latency
- **Failure signatures**: Incorrect feature identification leads to cascading errors in rule-based classification; API rate limits affect throughput
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test GPT-4o's ability to identify specific architectural features (windows, radiators, lighting) from building images
  2. Validate the rule base by feeding known observations and checking classification accuracy
  3. Compare multi-prompt approach against single comprehensive prompt for accuracy and cost-effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal set of domain-specific prompts and knowledge rules for maximizing the accuracy of LLM-based building feature extraction across different geographic regions and building types? The paper demonstrates that domain-specific prompts and knowledge rules significantly improve LLM performance, but notes that these were manually created and could be optimized through iterative fine-tuning or automated prompt engineering.

### Open Question 2
How does the accuracy of automated building feature extraction compare to professional energy audits when scaled to larger datasets and diverse building types? The paper compares AI performance against a single human expert and ground truth data, showing the AI performs better than the human but with room for improvement.

### Open Question 3
What is the most cost-effective balance between LLM capabilities and simpler image-to-text models for different stages of the building feature extraction pipeline? The paper uses GPT-4o for all tasks but notes that future work could automate image categorization using either GPT-4o or "another simpler image-to-text model."

## Limitations

- The method's success heavily depends on GPT-4o's ability to accurately identify specific architectural features from diverse images
- Domain knowledge rules are currently tailored for UK buildings and may require significant adaptation for other regions
- The evaluation is limited to 47 apartments, which may not capture the full variability of building types and conditions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The method's feasibility for generating sustainability data from images and its superior performance compared to human experts
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of the approach to different building types and regions
- **Medium confidence**: The scalability of the method to large building portfolios

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-regional validation**: Test the method on buildings from different countries/regions with varying architectural styles, building codes, and heating systems to assess rule base adaptability and LLM performance across diverse contexts.

2. **Human expert replication study**: Have multiple building sustainability experts independently assess the same apartment images to establish the variance in human performance and validate the single-expert comparison results.

3. **Robustness to image quality variation**: Systematically degrade image quality (resolution, lighting, angle) in the test dataset to quantify how GPT-4o's feature identification accuracy changes under realistic data collection conditions.
