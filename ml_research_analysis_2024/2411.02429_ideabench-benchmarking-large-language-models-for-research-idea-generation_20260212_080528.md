# IdeaBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Research Idea Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.02429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02429
- Reference count: 33
- Most LLMs can generate ideas similar to target papers (BERTScore ~0.59-0.62)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IdeaBench, a benchmark system designed to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to generate research ideas. The system comprises a dataset of 2,374 influential biomedical papers with their 29,408 reference papers, and an evaluation framework that personalizes quality assessment through GPT-4o ranking based on user-specified indicators (novelty, feasibility) and computes "Insight Scores" ranging from 0 to 1. Experiments with various LLMs (Llama, Gemini, GPT series) show that while most models can generate ideas similar to target papers, they excel in novelty but lag in feasibility. The study reveals a trade-off between novelty and feasibility, and demonstrates that reference filtering helps lower-capacity models produce more novel ideas.

## Method Summary
IdeaBench evaluates LLMs for research idea generation through a two-stage process. First, it constructs a dataset of 2,374 biomedical target papers and their 29,408 reference papers. Second, it generates research ideas by prompting LLMs with target paper abstracts and filtered reference paper abstracts. The system then uses GPT-4o to rank generated ideas based on user-defined quality indicators (novelty, feasibility), and calculates "Insight Scores" as relative rankings. Reference papers are filtered based on citation counts and relevance to focus the model on the most pertinent information. The evaluation framework is designed to be personalized and scalable, accommodating different research contexts and quality preferences.

## Key Results
- Most LLMs can generate ideas similar to target papers (BERTScore ~0.59-0.62)
- LLMs excel in novelty (Insight Scores >0.6) but lag in feasibility (<0.5)
- Reference filtering improves novelty scores for lower-capacity models
- Clear trade-off exists between novelty and feasibility across all tested LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The IdeaBench system generates research ideas that are similar to target papers by grounding LLMs in the same context considered by human researchers through reference papers.
- Mechanism: By providing LLMs with abstracts from reference papers that human researchers used to generate ideas, the system creates contextual grounding that allows the model to access relevant parametric knowledge from its pretraining corpus.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively utilize contextual information from reference papers to generate research ideas that align with human-generated ideas.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To harness the capabilities of LLMs for generating research ideas, we adopt a similar approach by grounding the LLMs in the same context considered by human researchers."
  - [section] "Our motivation for this is to emulate human thought processes in LLMs, ensuring that the generated ideas are informed and contextually relevant."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If reference papers are not relevant or if LLMs cannot effectively utilize the contextual information provided.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The "Insight Score" metric can quantify user-defined quality indicators (novelty, feasibility) through personalized quality ranking and relative quality scoring.
- Mechanism: GPT-4o ranks research ideas based on user-specified quality indicators, then the Insight Score calculates the relative ranking position of the target paper's idea compared to generated ideas.
- Core assumption: GPT-4o can effectively rank research ideas according to user-defined quality indicators, and this ranking accurately reflects the quality of ideas.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our evaluation framework is a two-stage process: first, using GPT-4o to rank ideas based on user-specified quality indicators such as novelty and feasibility, enabling scalable personalization; and second, calculating relative ranking based 'Insight Score' to quantify the chosen quality indicator."
  - [section] "Our design ensures a versatile and comprehensive evaluation framework, capable of adapting to different research contexts and providing meaningful insights into the quality of LLM-generated ideas."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific metric implementation.
- Break condition: If GPT-4o cannot consistently rank ideas according to user-defined indicators or if the ranking does not correlate with actual idea quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reference filtering helps lower-capacity models produce more novel research ideas by removing irrelevant information that can distract the model.
- Mechanism: By filtering out references with fewer than five citations, non-primary research, and references not cited in the background section, the system reduces noise and focuses the model on most relevant information.
- Core assumption: Lower-capacity models are more susceptible to distraction from irrelevant references, and filtering improves their ability to generate novel ideas.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our motivation for implementing a significance-relevancy-based filtering process is to ensure that the reference papers align closely with the target paper's primary research ideas, thus maximizing the relevance and utility of the information provided to the LLMs."
  - [section] "Due to their lower capacity, these models are likely distracted by irrelevant references from target papers with fewer total references since most target papers have less than 16 references."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific filtering mechanism.
- Break condition: If filtering removes relevant information or if model capacity is not the limiting factor in idea generation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contextual grounding for LLMs
  - Why needed here: LLMs need relevant context to generate meaningful research ideas that align with human-generated ideas
  - Quick check question: Why is providing reference paper abstracts important for generating research ideas?

- Concept: Quality indicator definition and personalization
  - Why needed here: Different researchers may value different aspects of research ideas (novelty vs. feasibility), requiring flexible evaluation metrics
  - Quick check question: How does the Insight Score accommodate different user preferences for evaluating research ideas?

- Concept: Reference filtering and relevance assessment
  - Why needed here: Not all references are equally relevant to the target paper's main idea, and filtering improves the quality of generated ideas
  - Quick check question: What criteria are used to filter reference papers in the IdeaBench system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset construction (target papers + reference papers) -> Research idea generation (LLM prompt with reference context) -> Evaluation framework (personalized ranking + Insight Score) -> API services for LLM interactions

- Critical path: Reference paper collection → Reference filtering → LLM idea generation → GPT-4o ranking → Insight Score calculation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Reference filtering improves lower-capacity model performance but may remove some relevant information
  - Using GPT-4o for ranking adds computational cost but provides flexible quality assessment
  - The system requires extensive reference papers, which may be resource-intensive

- Failure signatures:
  - Low semantic similarity between generated and target ideas
  - Generated ideas are incoherent or irrelevant
  - Insight Scores do not correlate with actual idea quality
  - GPT-4o ranking is inconsistent across different runs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate research ideas with and without reference filtering to measure the impact on novelty scores
  2. Test different numbers of generated ideas (n) to observe effects on Insight Score granularity
  3. Compare Insight Scores across different quality indicators (novelty vs. feasibility) for the same set of generated ideas

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the number of generated research ideas (n) affect the validity and comparability of the Insight Score metric?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how varying n affects the Insight Score and recommends using the same n for comparing different LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that the target paper's absolute rank shifts as n increases, affecting Insight Scores, but doesn't establish an optimal n or how this impacts cross-study comparisons.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing Insight Scores across different n values for the same LLMs and target papers, establishing stability thresholds.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between novelty and feasibility in LLM-generated research ideas, and how can this trade-off be managed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates a general trade-off between novelty and feasibility, with most LLMs scoring higher in novelty than feasibility.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this trade-off, it doesn't provide strategies for optimizing both metrics simultaneously or determine if the trade-off is inherent or adjustable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of prompting strategies or model architectures that can optimize for both novelty and feasibility metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does reference filtering impact the quality of generated research ideas across different LLM capacities and resource scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that reference filtering helps lower-capacity models generate more novel ideas but loses benefits when all references are available.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the mechanisms behind this filtering effect or determine optimal filtering strategies for different model capacities and resource constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing various filtering algorithms and their effects on idea quality across different model sizes and reference availability scenarios.

## Limitations

- Significant trade-off exists between novelty and feasibility, with models performing notably better on novelty than feasibility
- Effectiveness of reference filtering for lower-capacity models remains uncertain, as the underlying mechanism is not well-established
- Reliance on GPT-4o for ranking introduces potential bias and depends on its ability to accurately assess research idea quality

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The system's ability to generate ideas similar to target papers (BERTScore ~0.59-0.62) is well-supported by empirical results across multiple LLMs and model families.
- **Medium Confidence**: The insight that reference filtering improves novelty scores for lower-capacity models is supported by experimental data, but the underlying mechanism (distraction vs. knowledge limitations) remains uncertain.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the evaluation framework to non-biomedical domains and the assumption that GPT-4o ranking accurately reflects true idea quality across diverse research contexts.

## Next Checks

1. Test the IdeaBench framework on non-biomedical domains (e.g., computer science, social sciences) to assess cross-domain generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing Insight Scores when using different ranking models (e.g., Claude, open-source alternatives) to GPT-4o to evaluate potential bias in the evaluation framework.
3. Perform longitudinal studies tracking the actual implementation and impact of LLM-generated ideas over time to validate whether high novelty scores correlate with real-world research success.
