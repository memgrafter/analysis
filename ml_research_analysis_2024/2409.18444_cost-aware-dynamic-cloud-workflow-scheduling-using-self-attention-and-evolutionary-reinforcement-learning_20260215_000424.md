# Cost-Aware Dynamic Cloud Workflow Scheduling using Self-Attention and Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.18444
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18444
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: SPN-CWS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple benchmark CDMWS problems, achieving better trade-offs between VM rental costs and SLA penalties

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the cost-aware dynamic multi-workflow scheduling (CDMWS) problem in cloud computing, which aims to minimize total costs including VM rental fees and SLA violation penalties when assigning VM instances to execute tasks in dynamically arriving workflows. The authors propose SPN-CWS, a novel self-attention policy network that captures global information from all candidate VMs simultaneously, unlike traditional methods that process VMs separately. They develop an Evolution Strategy-based Reinforcement Learning (ERL) system to train SPN-CWS reliably and effectively, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms.

## Method Summary
The method uses a Self-Attention Policy Network (SPN-CWS) with five key units: global information learning using multi-head self-attention, task feature enhancement, feature concatenation, priority mapping, and VM selection. The network is trained using an Evolution Strategy-based Reinforcement Learning (ERL) system that samples a population of individuals, evaluates their fitness based on total cost, and updates parameters using policy gradients. The approach is evaluated on six VM types based on Amazon EC2 specifications and four workflow patterns (CyberShake, Montage, Inspiral, SIPHT) with small/medium/large sizes, using 30 independent runs for evaluation.

## Key Results
- SPN-CWS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms including manual heuristics, genetic programming hyper-heuristics, and traditional RL methods
- The approach achieves better trade-offs between VM rental costs and SLA penalties while maintaining good convergence speed and stability
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark CDMWS problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Self-attention allows SPN-CWS to capture global relationships among all candidate VMs simultaneously, improving scheduling decisions
- **Mechanism**: Multi-head self-attention computes weighted sums of VM features where weights are determined by similarity between every pair of VMs, allowing each VM's features to attend to features of other VMs
- **Core assumption**: VM relationships and global status information are crucial for effective workflow scheduling decisions
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] Traditional policy networks separately determine VM suitability without considering all VMs simultaneously; [section] SPN-CWS uses multi-head self-attention to enhance global VM information processing
- **Break condition**: If VM features are completely independent or if computational overhead outweighs benefits for small numbers of candidate VMs

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Evolution Strategy-based Reinforcement Learning provides more robust training than gradient-based RL methods
- **Mechanism**: ERL samples population of N individuals from Gaussian distribution around current policy parameters, evaluates fitness based on total cost, and updates parameters using policy gradients estimated from sampled population
- **Core assumption**: Scheduling problem has delayed rewards and complex reward landscapes that make gradient-based methods less effective
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] ERL is more robust to varied hyperparameter settings and can effectively cope with delayed or sparse rewards; [section] ERL can alleviate issues with gradient-based RL sensitivity
- **Break condition**: If reward signal is immediate and dense, or if computational resources for ERL sampling become prohibitive

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Processing task and VM features at multiple abstraction levels enables more informed scheduling decisions
- **Mechanism**: SPN-CWS maps VM features to high-dimensional space, applies self-attention, separately processes task features in high-dimensional space, then concatenates task and VM features before mapping to priority values
- **Core assumption**: Relationship between task characteristics and VM suitability is complex and benefits from hierarchical feature processing
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] SPN-CWS consists of five key units including global information learning, task feature enhancement, and feature concatenation; [section] Processed task-info is concatenated separately with VM-INFO for each candidate VM
- **Break condition**: If simpler architectures achieve similar performance or if additional complexity leads to overfitting

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of workflows
  - **Why needed here**: Workflows are represented as DAGs where tasks have dependencies, and understanding this structure is crucial for scheduling decisions
  - **Quick check question**: In a DAG-based workflow, can a task begin execution before all its predecessor tasks are completed?

- **Concept**: Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints and deadline calculation
  - **Why needed here**: The scheduling objective includes minimizing SLA violation penalties, requiring understanding of how deadlines are calculated and enforced
  - **Quick check question**: How is the SLA deadline for a workflow calculated based on its arrival time and minimum makespan?

- **Concept**: Reinforcement Learning fundamentals (states, actions, rewards)
  - **Why needed here**: The scheduling policy is learned through RL, requiring understanding of how states represent the scheduling problem, actions represent VM selections, and rewards represent total costs
  - **Quick check question**: In this problem, what constitutes the state, action, and reward in the RL framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: State input → VM feature embedding → Self-attention → Task feature enhancement → Feature concatenation → Priority mapping → VM Selection → Execution → Reward calculation
- **Critical path**: State input → VM feature embedding → Self-attention → Task feature enhancement → Feature concatenation → Priority mapping → VM Selection → Execution → Reward calculation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Self-attention provides global context but increases computational complexity; ERL is robust but requires more samples than gradient-based methods; multi-stage processing captures complexity but risks overfitting
- **Failure signatures**: If self-attention fails, VMs will be selected based on local features only, potentially missing optimal global configurations; if ERL fails, policy may not converge or may converge to poor solutions; if feature processing fails, network may not effectively combine task and VM information
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare SPN-CWS performance against baseline using only local VM features (no self-attention) on small-scenario problems
  2. Test ERL vs. standard policy gradient methods on the same problem to verify robustness claims
  3. Evaluate impact of different embedding dimensions (M and Q parameters) on scheduling performance to find optimal network capacity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the performance of SPN-CWS compare to online reinforcement learning techniques that can adapt to dynamic changes in workflow patterns over time? (The authors plan to investigate online RL techniques for SPN-CWS to enhance adaptability to dynamic changes such as evolving workflow patterns)
- What is the impact of different self-attention mechanism configurations (number of heads, attention dimension size) on the performance of SPN-CWS for CDMWS problems? (The paper uses specific values but doesn't explore sensitivity to these hyperparameters)
- How does SPN-CWS perform on CDMWS problems with heterogeneous cloud environments that include different types of resources beyond just VMs (e.g., containers, serverless functions)? (The current formulation is designed specifically for VM instances)

## Limitations
- The paper claims SPN-CWS captures global VM relationships through self-attention but doesn't provide ablation studies comparing performance with and without self-attention
- ERL's superiority over gradient-based RL methods is asserted but not empirically validated against standard policy gradient approaches in the same experimental setup
- The computational overhead of self-attention relative to the performance gains is not discussed, which is critical for practical deployment considerations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The basic framework of using self-attention to capture VM relationships and ERL for training is sound and technically feasible
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods are likely real but may be overstated without proper ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: The relative importance of each mechanism (self-attention vs. ERL vs. multi-stage processing) in achieving the reported performance is unclear

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Compare SPN-CWS performance with a baseline using only local VM features (removing self-attention) to quantify the actual contribution of global information learning
2. **Training method comparison**: Implement and test a standard policy gradient RL baseline with the same network architecture to validate ERL's claimed superiority for this problem
3. **Scalability analysis**: Measure the computational overhead of self-attention relative to the number of candidate VMs and determine the break-even point where simpler methods become more efficient
