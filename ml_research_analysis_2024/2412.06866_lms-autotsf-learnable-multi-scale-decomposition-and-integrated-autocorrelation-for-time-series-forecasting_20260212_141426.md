## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.06866
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06866
- Authors: Ibrahim Delibasoglu; Sanjay Chakraborty; Fredrik Heintz
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance across multiple time series forecasting benchmarks with superior long-term forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency

## Executive Summary
LMS-AutoTSF introduces a novel time series forecasting architecture that combines learnable multi-scale decomposition with integrated autocorrelation. The model dynamically decomposes time series data into trend and seasonal components using learnable low-pass and high-pass filters in the frequency domain, eliminating the need for predefined decomposition methods. Autocorrelation is integrated through lagged differences to capture temporal dependencies, while fully connected layers process temporal and channel interactions. Multi-scale down-sampling enables the model to capture both local and global patterns across different temporal resolutions. The architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming models like TimeMixer, iTransformer, and PatchTST.

## Method Summary
LMS-AutoTSF is a 4-scale time series forecasting architecture that uses learnable FFT-based decomposition to separate trend and seasonal components, integrates autocorrelation through lagged differences, and employs fully connected layers for temporal processing. The model progressively down-samples input sequences using average pooling to create multiple temporal resolutions, then applies learnable low-pass and high-pass filters in the frequency domain to capture trend and seasonal patterns respectively. Autocorrelation is computed as lagged differences and element-wise multiplied with temporal processing outputs. The architecture uses batch size 32, learning rate 0.0001 (except for PEMS datasets), ADAM optimizer with L2 loss, and is evaluated on eight benchmark datasets with metrics including MSE, MAE, sMAPE, MAPE, MASE, and OWA across various prediction horizons.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming TimeMixer, iTransformer, and PatchTST
- Superior accuracy in long-term forecasting tasks while maintaining computational efficiency
- Significantly faster execution times and fewer FLOPs compared to existing methods
- Effective for high-dimensional time series forecasting across diverse time horizons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learnable multi-scale decomposition enables the model to adaptively capture both trend and seasonal components without relying on predefined decomposition methods.
- Mechanism: The architecture uses learnable low-pass and high-pass filters in the frequency domain to dynamically separate trend (low-frequency) and seasonal (high-frequency) components from the input time series.
- Core assumption: The frequency domain representation of time series data contains separable trend and seasonal components that can be learned rather than predefined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations."
  - [section] "For each scale k, downsampled time series is decomposed into trend (T) and seasonality (S) components with learnable (differentiable) layers in the frequency domain."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors focus on decomposition but don't specifically mention learnable frequency-domain filtering as implemented in LMS-AutoTSF.
- Break condition: If the time series data contains overlapping frequency components that cannot be cleanly separated by learnable filters, or if the relationship between frequency components and trend/seasonal patterns varies significantly across datasets.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Integrated autocorrelation through lagged differences improves temporal dependency capture beyond what frequency-domain decomposition alone provides.
- Mechanism: Autocorrelation is computed as lagged differences between consecutive time steps, and this feature is element-wise multiplied with the temporal processing output to emphasize temporal variation patterns.
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies in time series can be effectively captured through autocorrelation features that highlight how values change over consecutive time steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively."
  - [section] "In the Encoder, firstly input (consider T for scale k: T (k)t) is passed through a temporal processing F C layer, and then processed temporal data xtemp is multiplied by the autocorrelation which is the lagged difference of the input of the Encoder module."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about autocorrelation integration, though some mention decomposition and temporal modeling separately.
- Break condition: If the autocorrelation features become redundant with what the frequency-domain decomposition already captures, or if lagged differences don't effectively represent the temporal dependencies in certain types of time series data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-scale down-sampling with K=4 scales allows the model to capture both local and global patterns across different temporal resolutions simultaneously.
- Mechanism: The input sequence is progressively down-sampled using average pooling at different scales, enabling each scale to process the data at a different temporal resolution and capture patterns at varying time horizons.
- Core assumption: Time series patterns exist at multiple temporal scales and can be better captured by processing the same data at different resolutions rather than using a single scale.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multi-scale down-sampling enables the model to capture both local and global patterns across different temporal resolutions."
  - [section] "To capture both local and global patterns in the time series, we apply multi-scale down-sampling of the input data. The input sequence is progressively down-sampled using an average pooling layer, with each scale indexed by k representing different temporal resolutions."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - corpus neighbors mention multi-scale decomposition but don't specifically discuss the progressive down-sampling approach with multiple scales as implemented in LMS-AutoTSF.
- Break condition: If the temporal patterns in the data don't exhibit meaningful variation across scales, or if the computational overhead of processing multiple scales outweighs the benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fourier Transform and frequency domain analysis
  - Why needed here: The model relies on FFT to transform time series data into the frequency domain for learnable decomposition, requiring understanding of how frequency components relate to trend and seasonal patterns.
  - Quick check question: How does the Fast Fourier Transform convert a time series signal into its frequency domain representation, and what does each frequency component represent?

- Concept: Autocorrelation and lagged differences
  - Why needed here: The model integrates autocorrelation through lagged differences to capture temporal dependencies, requiring understanding of how past values correlate with future values in time series.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between autocorrelation as a statistical concept and the lagged difference approach used in this architecture, and when might each be more appropriate?

- Concept: Multi-scale processing and temporal resolution
  - Why needed here: The model uses multiple scales to capture patterns at different time horizons, requiring understanding of how temporal resolution affects pattern detection in time series.
  - Quick check question: How does changing the temporal resolution of time series data affect the types of patterns that can be detected, and what are the tradeoffs between high and low temporal resolution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Multi-scale down-sampling → Per-scale decomposition (FFT → learnable filters → trend/seasonal separation) → Autocorrelation integration → Temporal and channel processing → Scale-specific predictions → Concatenation → Final FC layer → Output
- Critical path: Input → Multi-scale down-sampling → Per-scale decomposition (FFT → learnable filters → trend/seasonal separation) → Autocorrelation integration → Temporal and channel processing → Scale-specific predictions → Concatenation → Final FC layer → Output
- Design tradeoffs: The architecture trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using lightweight MLP-based processing instead of transformers, and trades model complexity for flexibility by using learnable decomposition instead of predefined methods. The multi-scale approach adds computational overhead but improves pattern capture across different time horizons.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on datasets with non-stationary frequency components, overfitting on datasets with limited temporal patterns, computational bottlenecks when scaling to very high-dimensional time series, failure to converge when learnable filters cannot find meaningful frequency separations.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance with fixed decomposition methods (like STL) versus learnable decomposition on datasets with known seasonal patterns to validate the benefit of adaptive decomposition.
  2. Test the impact of autocorrelation integration by running ablations with and without lagged differences on datasets with strong temporal dependencies.
  3. Evaluate the effect of different numbers of scales (K=2, K=4, K=8) on forecasting accuracy to find the optimal trade-off between computational cost and performance.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing autocorrelation integration and learnable decomposition separately to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance.
2. Test the model on synthetic datasets with controlled trend and seasonal components to validate the effectiveness of learnable frequency-domain decomposition versus predefined methods.
3. Evaluate model robustness by testing performance degradation when trained on limited data samples to assess overfitting potential across different dataset sizes.
