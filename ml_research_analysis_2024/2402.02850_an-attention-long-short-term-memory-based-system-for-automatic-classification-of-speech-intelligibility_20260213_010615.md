# An Attention Long Short-Term Memory based system for automatic classification of speech intelligibility

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.02850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02850
- Authors: Miguel Fernández-Díaz; Ascensión Gallardo-Antolín
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Attention LSTM architecture achieves 40.87% relative error reduction over SVM baseline and 8.54% over LSTM with mean-pooling on UA-Speech dysarthric speech intelligibility classification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an LSTM-based system with attention mechanism for automatic classification of speech intelligibility in dysarthric speech. The approach uses log-mel spectrograms as input features and evaluates three architectures: basic LSTM, LSTM with mean-pooling, and LSTM with attention-pooling. The attention mechanism learns to weight frames based on their relevance to intelligibility classification, significantly improving performance over both traditional SVM approaches with hand-crafted features and simpler LSTM architectures.

## Method Summary
The method extracts log-mel spectrograms (32 mel filters, 10 ms frame rate, 20 ms window length) from dysarthric speech recordings in the UA-Speech database. Three LSTM architectures are implemented and compared: a basic LSTM using the last frame output, an LSTM with mean-pooling across all frames, and an LSTM with attention-pooling that computes weighted sums using learned attention weights. Models are trained with Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.0002, batch size 32, max 40 epochs) using speaker-independent splits (50% training, 15% validation, 35% test). The attention mechanism computes frame weights via a learned parameter vector and softmax normalization.

## Key Results
- Attention LSTM achieves 86.3% accuracy, outperforming SVM baseline by 40.87% relative error reduction
- Attention LSTM shows 8.54% relative improvement over LSTM with mean-pooling
- Removing silence/noise frames via VAD preprocessing degrades performance, suggesting disfluencies carry intelligibility information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Attention mechanism learns relevance weights that improve LSTM classification by emphasizing important temporal frames
- Mechanism: For each LSTM output frame yt, compute attention weight αt = exp(uᵀyt)/Σexp(uᵀyt) where u is a learnable vector; final representation z = Σαtyt
- Core assumption: Some frames contain more intelligibility information than others, and a simple inner product with a learned vector can capture this
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "incorporating a simple attention mechanism to enhance the LSTM-based system" and "outperforms ... LSTM-based system with mean-pooling, achieving a relative error reduction of ... 8.54%"; [section] "the contribution of each frame should be weighted according to its relevance to the task" and Equation (3) defining αt
- Break condition: If the learned attention vector u does not capture discriminative patterns, or if all frames are equally informative, attention adds no benefit

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LSTMs are effective because they model temporal dependencies crucial for intelligibility prediction
- Mechanism: LSTM processes log-mel spectrogram sequences x1…xT, maintaining memory of past frames; output depends on present and past inputs, enabling learning of long-term patterns like disfluencies
- Core assumption: Intelligibility is related to temporal phenomena (disfluencies, interruptions) that require modeling past context
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks ... for this purpose" and "capability for modeling temporal sequences, as it is the case of speech signals"; [section] "LSTM outputs depend on the present and previous inputs" and "temporal modeling performed by LSTM is crucial"
- Break condition: If intelligibility cues are primarily static spectral features, temporal modeling adds little value

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Removing silence/noise frames via VAD degrades performance because disfluencies and artifacts carry intelligibility information
- Mechanism: VAD eliminates frames that may contain hesitations, repetitions, or other dysarthric speech markers; LSTMs can learn to use these cues
- Core assumption: Dysarthric speech contains informative non-speech elements (pauses, stuttering) that help classify intelligibility
- Evidence anchors: [section] "the removal of the non-speech regions negatively affects the performance" and "silence pauses and other speech artifacts ... convey relevant information for the systems"; [section] Figure 6 shows attention assigns non-zero weights to silence frames in low-intelligibility cases
- Break condition: If disfluencies are rare or noise dominates, keeping non-speech frames harms classification

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs)
  - Why needed here: MFCCs are standard speech features that capture spectral envelope; understanding them helps compare against log-mel spectrogram input
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between MFCCs and log-mel spectrograms in terms of dimensionality and information content?

- Concept: Recurrent neural networks and vanishing gradient problem
  - Why needed here: LSTMs solve vanishing gradients, enabling learning of long-term dependencies in speech sequences
  - Quick check question: Why can't a standard RNN learn dependencies beyond a few time steps in speech signals?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and weighted pooling
  - Why needed here: Attention allows the model to focus on relevant frames rather than treating all equally; understanding this is key to interpreting improvements over mean-pooling
  - Quick check question: How does attention pooling differ from mean pooling in terms of frame contribution to the final representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (log-mel spectrogram T×32) → Masking (handles padding) → Dense1 (32 neurons) → LSTM (128 units) → Attention mechanism (learnable u vector, softmax weights) → Dense2 (50 neurons, dropout) → Output Dense (3 softmax units for L/M/H classes)
- Critical path: log-mel input → LSTM processing → attention weighting → classification
- Design tradeoffs: Using log-mel spectrograms instead of hand-crafted features reduces preprocessing but may lose some engineered cues; attention adds complexity but improves accuracy; VAD removal preserves artifacts but increases noise
- Failure signatures: If accuracy plateaus, check if attention weights are near-uniform (indicating no learned relevance); if training loss decreases but validation loss increases, overfitting may be occurring; if performance drops with longer sequences, padding may be introducing noise
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train Basic LSTM (no attention, no VAD) and compare accuracy to mean-pooling baseline to confirm temporal modeling benefit
  2. Add attention mechanism to Basic LSTM and measure improvement over mean-pooling to verify attention helps
  3. Test with VAD preprocessing and without to confirm that keeping disfluency artifacts improves results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would incorporating auditory saliency features into the attention mechanism affect intelligibility classification performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that a future line of work will focus on the incorporation of auditory saliency features for weights computation in the attention mechanism
- Why unresolved: The current attention mechanism uses a simple approach with learnable parameters. The impact of more sophisticated saliency-based weighting is unknown
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating the proposed saliency-based attention mechanism on the same UA-Speech database, comparing accuracy and error rates to the current attention LSTM model

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using modulation spectrum features as input to the LSTM-based systems instead of log-mel spectrograms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest using the modulation spectrum as an alternative input feature for the LSTM-based systems in future work
- Why unresolved: The modulation spectrum contains temporal dynamics relevant to intelligibility, but its effectiveness as input to LSTMs is unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing LSTM-based systems with modulation spectrum features as input, and comparing the results to the current log-mel spectrogram approach in terms of accuracy and error rates

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the attention LSTM model vary with different levels of dysarthria severity in the UA-Speech database?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the models on the UA-Speech database with varying dysarthria severity, but does not provide a detailed analysis of performance across severity levels
- Why unresolved: Understanding how well the model performs for different severity levels can provide insights into its strengths and limitations
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a detailed analysis of the attention LSTM model's performance on different severity levels within the UA-Speech database, reporting accuracy and error rates for each level

## Limitations

- Small dataset size (16 speakers) raises overfitting concerns and limits generalizability to larger, more diverse dysarthric speech populations
- Performance improvement from attention (8.54% relative) is modest, suggesting the mechanism may be capturing dataset-specific patterns rather than universal intelligibility features
- Paper doesn't specify random seeds for the 20 runs, making exact reproduction and validation of reported standard deviations challenging

## Confidence

- High confidence: LSTMs effectively model temporal dependencies in dysarthric speech; removing VAD preprocessing preserves informative disfluencies
- Medium confidence: Attention mechanism improves classification by emphasizing relevant frames; log-mel spectrograms are sufficient input features
- Low confidence: The specific attention implementation details and learned attention patterns generalize beyond the UA-Speech database

## Next Checks

1. Test the attention LSTM architecture on a different dysarthric speech dataset (e.g., TORGO or MAND) to verify generalization of the attention mechanism
2. Analyze attention weight distributions across speakers and intelligibility levels to confirm they capture meaningful patterns rather than memorization
3. Compare attention weights against human-annotated disfluency markers to validate that the model focuses on clinically relevant speech regions
