# GIVE: Structured Reasoning of Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08475
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08475
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves up to 88.2% accuracy compared to 43.5% baseline, enables smaller models to outperform larger ones on scientific tasks

## Executive Summary
GIVE addresses the challenge of improving large language model reasoning in scientific domains where external knowledge bases are incomplete or difficult to construct. The method introduces Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation, which combines parametric (LLM internal) and non-parametric (external knowledge graph) information through a three-step process: observing relevant entities, reflecting through divergent reasoning to generate potential connections, and speaking by synthesizing these into a final answer. The approach identifies entity groups related to query concepts, induces connections using both expert knowledge and LLM-generated "veracity extrapolation," and employs counterfactual reasoning to reduce hallucinations. Experiments show GIVE achieves up to 88.2% accuracy compared to 43.5% baseline, enables smaller models like GPT3.5T to outperform larger ones like GPT4 on scientific tasks, and works effectively across knowledge graphs ranging from 135 to over 840k nodes. The method is training-free and produces fully interpretable reasoning processes.

## Method Summary
GIVE combines parametric (LLM internal) and non-parametric (external knowledge graph) knowledge through a training-free framework. The method observes relevant entities by parsing queries and finding semantically similar KG concepts, reflects by generating potential connections using LLM's internal knowledge and validating against the KG, and speaks by synthesizing a final answer. It constructs entity groups by linking queried entities with related KG concepts, induces connections using LLM-generated "veracity extrapolation" that assesses potential edges, and employs counterfactual reasoning to document rejected connections and reduce hallucinations. The approach works across knowledge graphs of varying sizes and domains without requiring fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 88.2% accuracy compared to 43.5% baseline on biomedical tasks
- Enables GPT3.5-turbo to outperform GPT4 on scientific reasoning tasks
- Works effectively across knowledge graphs ranging from 135 to over 840k nodes
- Provides fully interpretable reasoning processes with training-free implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GIVE improves LLM reasoning by combining parametric and non-parametric information through structured associative thinking
- Mechanism: Breaks down queries into fundamental concepts, forms entity groups by linking queried entities with related KG concepts, then induces connections using LLM's parametric knowledge and validates them against limited external knowledge
- Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient internal knowledge to extrapolate potential connections between semantically similar concepts even when direct evidence is absent in the KG
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "merges parametric and non-parametric memories to improve accurate reasoning with minimal external input"
  - [section 3.4.3] "veracity extrapolation with internal knowledge... instructs the LLM to assess each potential edge between node groups"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss KG reasoning but don't explicitly validate the extrapolation mechanism
- Break condition: If LLM lacks relevant internal knowledge to extrapolate meaningful connections, or if KG is too sparse to provide any valid inspiration

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GIVE's counterfactual reasoning reduces hallucinations by explicitly identifying and documenting rejected potential connections
- Mechanism: During inter-group connection induction, prompts LLM to evaluate all potential relations between entity groups, categorizing them as confirmed, rejected, or uncertain
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably distinguish between valid and invalid potential connections when explicitly prompted to evaluate them
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "constructs counterfactual reasoning to mitigate hallucinations"
  - [section 3.5] "GIVE further directs LLM to refine this answer with the full context and the counter-factual knowledge set"
  - [corpus] Weak - no explicit validation of counterfactual reasoning effectiveness in related literature
- Break condition: If LLM's confidence judgments are unreliable, leading to false rejections of valid connections or acceptance of invalid ones

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GIVE's entity group construction with semantic similarity enables reasoning beyond strict information retrieval
- Mechanism: For each queried entity, finds p most similar concepts in the KG using pretrained LM encoder, creating entity groups that broaden reasoning scope from strict information retrieval to inferring relationships over broader relevant concepts
- Core assumption: Semantically similar KG entities can serve as effective "inspiration" for reasoning about queried concepts, even without direct connections
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "find p most similar concepts to each entity in the latent space by comparing cosine similarities"
  - [section 4.7.3] "positive correlation between GIVE's performance and the expert ratio" suggests inspiration quality matters
  - [corpus] Moderate - related papers on KG reasoning mention semantic similarity but don't validate this specific approach
- Break condition: If semantic similarity in KG embedding space doesn't correlate with reasoning-relevant relationships, or if KG lacks sufficiently similar concepts

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge graph structure and traversal
  - Why needed here: Understanding how KGs represent entities and relations is fundamental to grasping how GIVE builds entity groups and induces connections
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the relationship "melatonin affects sleep" in a KG triplet format?

- Concept: Vector similarity and embedding spaces
  - Why needed here: GIVE uses cosine similarity between entity embeddings to find semantically similar concepts for entity group construction
  - Quick check question: What does a high cosine similarity between two entity embeddings indicate about their semantic relationship?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: GIVE relies on carefully structured prompts to extract entities, generate potential relations, and evaluate connection validity
  - Quick check question: How does chain-of-thought prompting differ from standard prompting, and why might it be useful for complex reasoning tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Query parser -> Entity encoder -> Connection inducer -> Veracity evaluator -> Answer generator -> KG interface

- Critical path:
  1. Query parsing → Entity extraction → Entity group construction
  2. Entity group construction → Connection induction → Veracity evaluation
  3. Veracity evaluation → Progressive answer generation (GIVEa → GIVEa+c → GIVEa+c+e)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of additional entities per group (n): More entities provide richer inspiration but increase computational cost and context length
  - KG density vs. sparsity: Dense KGs provide more inspiration but risk noise; sparse KGs are cleaner but may lack sufficient inspiration
  - Progressive vs. single-step answer generation: Progressive approach reduces hallucination risk but requires more LLM calls

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance despite correct implementation: Likely due to insufficient internal knowledge for extrapolation or KG lacking relevant concepts
  - Excessive context length: May indicate too many additional entities per group or overly dense KG connections
  - Inconsistent results across runs: Could signal instability in LLM's veracity evaluation or sensitivity to prompt phrasing

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test entity group construction with a simple KG and query, verifying the semantic similarity matching produces relevant related concepts
  2. Validate connection induction by providing known entity pairs and checking if the LLM generates plausible relations
  3. Verify progressive answer generation by running all three stages (GIVEa, GIVEa+c, GIVEa+c+e) on a controlled example and confirming the refinement process works as expected

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of additional entities per group (n) that balances accuracy and efficiency for GIVE across different scientific domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that GIVE performs best with n=1 or n=2 additional entities per group, but notes that the optimal value may vary by dataset and domain
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested n=1 and n=2, and while it notes these values work well, it doesn't systematically explore the full parameter space to determine the optimal value
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying n across a broader range (e.g., 0 to 5) on multiple scientific domains, measuring both accuracy and computational cost

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does GIVE's performance scale with knowledge graph density and size in real-world scientific applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tested GIVE on KGs ranging from 135 to 840k nodes, but notes that "the construction of comprehensive knowledge bases is daunting" in scientific realms
- Why unresolved: The experiments used synthetic KG variations rather than real scientific KGs of varying quality and completeness, and the paper doesn't address how GIVE would perform on actual incomplete or noisy scientific KGs
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of GIVE to real-world scientific KGs of varying quality (e.g., from different biomedical subfields) with systematic measurement of performance degradation as KG completeness decreases

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can GIVE be effectively integrated with reinforcement learning techniques to further improve reasoning performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that GIVE is "training-free" and contrasts it with RL-based approaches, but doesn't explore whether combining GIVE's structured reasoning with RL fine-tuning could yield additional benefits
- Why unresolved: The paper deliberately avoided training-based methods to demonstrate GIVE's effectiveness as a standalone framework, but doesn't investigate potential synergies with RL approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing GIVE alone versus GIVE combined with RL fine-tuning on reasoning tasks, measuring whether the combination provides statistically significant improvements over either approach individually

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on LLM's internal knowledge quality, which varies across models and domains
- Counterfactual reasoning claims to reduce hallucinations but lacks explicit validation of this mechanism
- Semantic similarity approach may break down in domains where semantic similarity doesn't align with reasoning-relevant relationships

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The three-step observe-reflect-speak framework is clearly defined and the progressive knowledge integration demonstrates measurable improvements in accuracy

**Medium Confidence**: The training-free nature and interpretability benefits are well-supported by experimental results across multiple knowledge graph sizes

**Low Confidence**: The scalability claims beyond tested KG sizes and generalizability across diverse scientific domains remain under-validated

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Test GIVE on a completely different scientific domain (e.g., physics or chemistry) to verify the approach generalizes beyond biomedical and commonsense reasoning
2. **Knowledge Graph Dependency Analysis**: Systematically vary KG density and semantic similarity quality to quantify their impact on GIVE's performance and identify failure thresholds
3. **Hallucination Quantification**: Implement explicit measures to compare hallucination rates between GIVE and baseline methods, particularly focusing on the counterfactual reasoning component's effectiveness
