# Beyond Data Quantity: Key Factors Driving Performance in Multilingual Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.12500
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12500
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) best predict MLLM performance with R² > 0.8, revealing token similarity and country similarity as critical factors beyond data quantity and model size.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates factors influencing multilingual language model (MLLM) performance across 204 languages using SIB-200 and Flores-200 datasets. Beyond the well-known effects of pre-train data percentage and model size, the analysis reveals that token similarity and country similarity are critical determinants of MLLM effectiveness. Token similarity enables cross-lingual transfer by leveraging shared vocabulary, while country similarity highlights the role of shared cultural and linguistic contexts. Using regression models and SHAP values, the research demonstrates that ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) best predict performance, with R-squared values exceeding 0.8 in many cases. These findings provide actionable insights for developing more equitable and effective MLLMs, particularly for underrepresented languages.

## Method Summary
The study analyzes MLLM performance across 204 languages using the SIB-200 dataset (classification) and Flores-200 dataset (machine translation). Researchers evaluate 14 model configurations from three families (Bloom, BloomZ, XGLM) in zero-shot and two-shot learning settings. They extract 12 features spanning model attributes (size, pre-train data), language features (geographical proximity, country similarity, token similarity), and resource-related factors. Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) predict performance metrics (F1 for classification, sacreBLEU for generation), with SHAP values quantifying feature importance. The approach combines empirical evaluation with feature importance analysis to identify performance drivers.

## Key Results
- Token similarity and country similarity are critical performance drivers beyond traditional factors like pre-train data and model size
- Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) outperform simpler linear models with R² values exceeding 0.8
- Geographical proximity shows stronger effects for classification tasks while country similarity has pronounced effects across both tasks
- Resource-related features (language vitality, digital support) have limited direct impact on model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Token similarity enables effective cross-lingual transfer by providing shared vocabulary overlap.
- Mechanism: When languages share similar tokens, the model can reuse learned representations, reducing the need for language-specific training data.
- Core assumption: Token overlap correlates with meaningful semantic similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Token similarity facilitates cross-lingual transfer, while country similarity highlights the importance of shared cultural and linguistic contexts."
  - [section]: "Token similarity emerged as one of the most crucial features influencing the performance of multilingual language models across both classification and generation tasks."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.473, average citations=0.0. (Weak corpus evidence for token similarity specifically)
- Break Condition: Token overlap exists but does not reflect meaningful semantic similarity, or when tokenizers tokenize languages differently creating false similarity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Country similarity improves model performance by capturing shared cultural and linguistic contexts.
- Mechanism: Languages spoken in the same countries often share cultural and linguistic traits, allowing models to leverage these shared contexts for better predictions.
- Core assumption: Country overlap implies shared linguistic and cultural characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "country similarity highlights the importance of shared cultural and linguistic contexts"
  - [section]: "country similarity had a more pronounced effect, frequently ranking among the top four features"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.473, average citations=0.0. (Weak corpus evidence for country similarity specifically)
- Break Condition: Languages share countries but have different linguistic roots, or political boundaries do not reflect linguistic realities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ensemble models outperform simpler linear models by capturing complex, non-linear interactions between features.
- Mechanism: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models can model complex relationships between model features, language features, and performance metrics.
- Core assumption: The relationship between features and model performance is non-linear with higher-order interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Using regression models and SHAP values, the research demonstrates that ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) best predict performance, with R-squared values exceeding 0.8 in many cases."
  - [section]: "Ensemble models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost consistently excelled, demonstrating strong predictive performance"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.473, average citations=0.0. (Weak corpus evidence for ensemble methods specifically)
- Break Condition: The true relationships between features and performance are actually linear, or when feature interactions are simpler than assumed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Regression analysis and SHAP values for feature importance
  - Why needed here: To quantify the impact of each feature on model performance and understand which factors drive success
  - Quick check question: How does SHAP value differ from traditional feature importance metrics like Gini importance?

- Concept: Cross-lingual transfer learning
  - Why needed here: To understand how models can leverage knowledge from high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource languages
  - Quick check question: What factors determine the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer between two languages?

- Concept: Multilingual tokenization and vocabulary overlap
  - Why needed here: To understand how token similarity is calculated and why it matters for model performance
  - Quick check question: How do different tokenization strategies (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece) affect token overlap between languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature extraction (12 features) -> Regression model training (10 models) -> Performance evaluation (R2, MSE) -> SHAP value calculation -> Feature importance analysis
- Critical path: Extract features → Train regression models → Evaluate model performance (R2, MSE) → Calculate SHAP values → Analyze feature importance
- Design tradeoffs: The study uses three specific models (Bloom, BloomZ, XGLM) which limits generalizability, but provides detailed analysis. The choice of 12 features balances comprehensiveness with computational feasibility.
- Failure signatures: Poor regression model performance (low R2, high MSE) indicates missing important features or incorrect model assumptions. Inconsistent SHAP values across tasks suggest feature-task interactions.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate a Random Forest model on classification task data to establish baseline performance
  2. Calculate SHAP values for the Random Forest model to identify top features
  3. Compare feature importance across classification and generation tasks to identify task-specific patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do complex, non-linear interactions between features influence multilingual model performance across different tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study highlights that ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost outperform simpler linear models, suggesting that non-linear interactions are crucial.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies which models capture these interactions, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of how specific feature combinations contribute to performance in different tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of feature interactions for each task, possibly using interaction plots or SHAP interaction values, would clarify how combinations of features like token similarity and model size drive performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the role of token similarity in facilitating transfer learning across languages with varying levels of linguistic similarity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Token similarity is identified as a critical feature for model performance, but the paper does not explore its impact on languages with differing linguistic characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how token similarity affects languages with high versus low linguistic similarity, leaving questions about its broader applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies analyzing token similarity effects on linguistically similar and dissimilar languages would clarify its role in transfer learning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do resource-related features like language vitality and digital support indirectly influence multilingual model performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that resource-related features have limited direct impact on performance, but they are crucial for understanding data availability.
- Why unresolved: The indirect effects of these features on model training and performance are not fully explored, particularly in underrepresented languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies examining the impact of resource availability on model training and subsequent performance would provide insights into these indirect effects.

## Limitations

- The study's scope is limited to three model families (Bloom, BloomZ, XGLM), which may not generalize to other MLLM architectures or training approaches.
- The corpus evidence for token similarity and country similarity mechanisms shows weak citation support, suggesting these relationships may be under-explored in existing literature.
- The reliance on zero-shot and two-shot settings may not capture the full complexity of MLLM performance in real-world fine-tuning scenarios.

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence Assessment:**
- **High Confidence**: Ensemble models outperform linear models (R2 > 0.8, supported by multiple regression experiments)
- **Medium Confidence**: Token similarity and country similarity are key performance drivers (supported by regression and SHAP analysis but weak corpus evidence)
- **Low Confidence**: The specific ranking and relative importance of all 12 features across tasks (dependent on the limited model selection and potential data artifacts)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Replicate the analysis using at least two additional MLLM families (e.g., mT5, mBERT) to test generalizability of the token similarity and country similarity findings across different architectural approaches.

2. **Temporal stability analysis**: Evaluate whether the identified feature importance rankings remain consistent when applied to MLLMs trained with different data distributions, tokenizers, or at different time periods to assess robustness to training variations.

3. **Controlled ablation study**: Systematically remove token similarity and country similarity features from the regression models to quantify their marginal contribution beyond traditional factors (pre-train data, model size) and verify these relationships aren't artifacts of feature correlation.
