# Multi-agent Assessment with QoS Enhancement for HD Map Updates in a Vehicular Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21460
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21460
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-agent Q-learning reduces latency by 40.4%, 36%, 43%, and 12% for voice, video, HD map, and best-effort services respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning solution for improving Quality of Service (QoS) in vehicular networks during high-definition (HD) map updates. The core idea is to replace a single-agent Q-learning approach with a distributed multi-agent system, where each vehicle acts as an independent agent. This reduces the complexity of the state-action space and avoids direct information sharing between agents by using a common reward function based on overall network performance (latency and throughput). The proposed solution is evaluated against a single-agent baseline across four service types: voice, video, HD map, and best-effort.

## Method Summary
The paper uses Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration (epsilon=0.2, learning rate=0.1, discount factor=0.99) for both single-agent and multi-agent configurations. The multi-agent approach assigns each vehicle as an independent agent that learns locally using state information from an edge server. The reward function is based on network-wide performance metrics (latency and throughput). Simulations compare centralized vs distributed learning approaches across four service types using OMNet++ 6 with INET library for IEEE802.11p protocol stack, and SUMO with OMNet++ module veins for traffic flow generation.

## Key Results
- Multi-agent Q-learning achieves 40.4% latency reduction for voice services
- 36% latency reduction for video services
- 43% latency reduction for HD map services
- 12% latency reduction for best-effort services
- Distributed learning outperforms centralized learning when vehicles have sufficient computational capacity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-agent Q-learning reduces state-action space dimensionality by localizing learning per service category.
- Mechanism: Each vehicle becomes an independent agent that learns its own Q-table based on local observations (sojourn time, total vehicles, active vehicles per category), rather than a single agent managing the entire network state.
- Core assumption: The same reward function across agents is sufficient to achieve optimal joint actions without explicit inter-agent communication.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This application improves the network performance by taking advantage of a smaller state, and action space whilst using a multi-agent approach."
  - [section] "Analyzing the state for the network Φ especially by subdividing the network per category, it is found that the agent's state space, the category is the same, which becomes redundant. Thereby, it could be established that the state space is reduced by one variable."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the paper claims dimensionality reduction but does not provide empirical validation of the mathematical relationship.
- Break condition: If the reward function cannot adequately capture network-wide performance, agents may learn suboptimal policies that conflict with overall QoS objectives.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Distributed learning reduces network overhead compared to centralized learning by eliminating the need to transmit all vehicle data to an edge server.
- Mechanism: Each vehicle performs Q-learning locally using state information obtained from the edge server, rather than sending its complete observation to a central agent for learning.
- Core assumption: Vehicles have sufficient computational capacity to run Q-learning locally without performance degradation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study also compares centralized and distributed learning, finding that distributed learning achieves better performance when vehicles have sufficient computational capacity."
  - [section] "If we consider the straightforward calculation for queuing delay [7], as depicted in Eq. (16), latency is bound to increase in centralized learning mode."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence; the paper mentions distributed learning but doesn't provide detailed comparison of computational requirements.
- Break condition: If vehicles lack computational resources, distributed learning will fail and centralized learning may become necessary despite higher latency.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using the same reward function across all agents enables effective coordination without explicit information sharing.
- Mechanism: All agents use the utility function based on latency and throughput to calculate rewards, allowing them to learn policies that collectively optimize network performance.
- Core assumption: The utility function adequately represents network status and provides sufficient information for each agent to learn an optimal policy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Besides, each agent is categorized as an independent learner (IL) to generate a smaller Q-table compared to the joint state-action space, S × Am. For simplicity, y is defined as y = γ ∗maxa′Q(s, a)−Q(s, a), and by replacing the utility function Eq. (1) as the reward r into Eq. (7) then, the updated equation is described as follows: Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α[U + y]"
  - [section] "As stated in [22], it is advantageous to use the same reward function in finding an equilibrium in a cooperative Multi-agent MDP (MMDP)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the paper cites theoretical advantages but doesn't demonstrate that this approach consistently achieves optimal performance across all scenarios.
- Break condition: If network conditions change rapidly or become highly non-stationary, the shared reward function may not provide sufficient differentiation for agents to learn effective policies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Q-learning temporal difference update
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Q-learning to optimize waiting times for data transmission without requiring gradient computation or deep neural networks.
  - Quick check question: Can you write the Q-learning update equation and explain what each term represents?

- Concept: State space dimensionality and its impact on learning complexity
  - Why needed here: The paper claims multi-agent approaches reduce dimensionality by having each agent manage a smaller state space, which is crucial for scalability in vehicular networks.
  - Quick check question: How does the state space size change when moving from a single agent managing all vehicles to multiple agents each managing a subset?

- Concept: Reward function design in multi-agent reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a shared reward function based on network-wide latency and throughput, which is central to achieving coordinated behavior without explicit communication.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and potential drawbacks of using the same reward function for all agents in a cooperative multi-agent setting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vehicles (agents) → Edge server (state information provider) → Local Q-learning execution → Action selection for transmission timing
- Critical path: Vehicle collects state → Edge server provides network metrics → Vehicle computes reward → Q-table update → Action selection for next transmission
- Design tradeoffs: Centralized learning provides better coordination but increases network overhead; distributed learning reduces overhead but requires more computational resources at each vehicle
- Failure signatures: Increased latency despite learning, Q-tables failing to converge, reward function not reflecting actual network performance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement single-agent baseline with Q-learning to establish performance baseline
  2. Add multi-agent framework with same reward function and compare latency reduction
  3. Compare centralized vs distributed learning approaches in terms of latency and computational overhead

Each experiment should maintain consistent simulation parameters (vehicle density, data rates, thresholds) to ensure valid comparisons between approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of multi-agent Q-learning compare to other RL algorithms (e.g., DQN, Actor-critic) in terms of latency, throughput, and fairness for HD map updates in VANETs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that previous studies have used DRL policy gradient, A2C, and A3C, but chose Q-learning due to lower computational cost. However, it does not compare the performance of these algorithms directly.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the proposed Q-learning approach against a single-agent baseline, not against other RL algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the performance of Q-learning, DQN, and Actor-critic in the same multi-agent setting for HD map updates in VANETs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of agents on the performance of the multi-agent Q-learning solution in terms of latency, throughput, and fairness for HD map updates in VANETs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that scalability is a challenge in multi-agent systems due to the sharing of information between agents. It also states that the optimal number of agents for a VANET scenario is a question addressed in the work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the performance with a fixed number of agents (one per service type and one per vehicle) and does not explore the impact of varying the number of agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating the performance of the multi-agent Q-learning solution with different numbers of agents (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16) for HD map updates in VANETs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed multi-agent Q-learning solution perform in a real-world VANET environment with multiple edge servers and heterogeneous agent objectives?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work will investigate the implementation of the proposed approach in an environment with multiple edge servers and heterogeneous agent objectives.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the performance in a simulated environment with a single edge server and homogeneous agent objectives.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study evaluating the performance of the proposed multi-agent Q-learning solution in a real-world VANET environment with multiple edge servers and heterogeneous agent objectives.

## Limitations

- State space reduction claims lack empirical validation and specific mathematical relationships are not demonstrated
- Distributed learning performance advantage assumes sufficient computational capacity at vehicles without specifying resource requirements
- Shared reward function mechanism lacks extensive validation across varying network conditions and non-stationary environments

## Confidence

- High confidence: Latency reduction measurements and throughput improvements across different service types
- Medium confidence: Claims about state space dimensionality reduction and distributed learning advantages
- Low confidence: Generalizability of results to real-world vehicular networks with dynamic conditions

## Next Checks

1. Implement controlled experiments varying vehicle computational capacity to quantify the threshold where distributed learning outperforms centralized approaches
2. Design stress tests with rapidly changing network conditions to evaluate the robustness of the shared reward function mechanism
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of state space reduction versus other factors (like reduced communication overhead) to performance improvements
