# Artificial intelligence and machine learning generated conjectures with TxGraffiti

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.02731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02731
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: TxGraffiti is an AI program that automates mathematical conjecture generation in graph theory using linear optimization and heuristic filtering

## Executive Summary
TxGraffiti is an artificial intelligence system designed to automatically generate mathematical conjectures in graph theory. The program analyzes databases of graphs and their precomputed properties, using linear optimization to propose potential inequalities between these properties. Two key heuristics, Theo and Dalmation-static, filter and prioritize the generated conjectures based on their generality and significance. The system has successfully produced numerous conjectures that have led to published mathematical research and is now available as an interactive web application.

## Method Summary
TxGraffiti works by first creating a database of graphs represented as edge lists, then computing various graph invariants (both numerical and Boolean) to create a feature table. Linear optimization is used to find sharp bounding functions between pairs of numerical properties across all graphs and subsets defined by Boolean properties. The Theo heuristic removes less general conjectures by comparing hypothesis statements, while the Dalmation-static heuristic filters redundant conjectures based on their equality instances. The final output consists of prioritized conjectures sorted by touch number (equality instances).

## Key Results
- Successfully generated numerous conjectures that led to published mathematical research
- Demonstrated effectiveness of combining linear optimization with heuristic filtering for conjecture generation
- Available as an interactive web application for exploring graph theory conjectures
- Shows potential for extending AI-assisted mathematical discovery beyond graph theory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linear optimization finds sharp bounding functions between graph invariants
- Mechanism: The system uses linear programming to minimize a linear function subject to constraints that enforce an inequality across all objects in the database. The objective function and constraints are designed so that solutions represent tight (sharp) bounds where equality holds for maximum number of objects.
- Core assumption: The relationship between graph invariants can be approximated by a linear function for a sufficient subset of the database
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This is achieved by solving a linear optimization problem, and in the simplest case, TxGraffiti aims to minimize a some linear function f(m, b) subject to a set of constraints."
  - [abstract] "It employs a combination of machine learning techniques and heuristic algorithms to discover novel relationships among graph invariants."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Theo heuristic ensures conjecture generality by eliminating redundant hypotheses
- Mechanism: Theo compares all generated conjectures and removes those whose hypothesis is a strict subset of another conjecture's hypothesis while maintaining the same inequality. This ensures the remaining conjectures have the most general possible hypotheses.
- Core assumption: More general conjectures are preferable as they provide broader mathematical insight and are less likely to be artifacts of specific data subsets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The Theo heuristic checks if any proposed inequality relation appears more than once in the list of conjectures, and then only selects the proposed conjectures with this inequality that have the most general hypothesis statement."
  - [section] "The reasoning for this heuristic is to put more emphasize on the more general conjecture, and thus, remove any conjecture that may follow from a more general statement."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dalmation-static heuristic ensures each conjecture provides new information
- Mechanism: After sorting conjectures by touch number (number of equality instances), Dalmation-static iteratively removes any conjecture whose equality instances are entirely contained within previously accepted conjectures, ensuring each remaining conjecture reveals novel graph instances.
- Core assumption: A conjecture is more valuable if it identifies new graph instances not covered by other conjectures, rather than merely being sharper on known instances
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "If the set of graphs attaining equality in Conjecture i does not contain a which is also graph not contained in G, then remove Conjecture i from the list of conjectures"
  - [abstract] "Two key heuristics, Theo and Dalmation-static, are then applied to filter and prioritize the generated conjectures based on their generality and significance."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear programming and optimization basics
  - Why needed here: The core mechanism for generating inequalities relies on formulating and solving linear optimization problems to find sharp bounds between graph invariants
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a feasible solution and an optimal solution in linear programming?

- Concept: Graph theory invariants and their relationships
  - Why needed here: Understanding properties like independence number, matching number, chromatic number, etc., is essential for interpreting the generated conjectures and their mathematical significance
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the independence number and the chromatic number of a graph?

- Concept: Heuristic filtering and information theory
  - Why needed here: The Theo and Dalmation-static heuristics implement principles from information theory to maximize the information gain from each conjecture while minimizing redundancy
  - Quick check question: How does the concept of information gain relate to the selection of conjectures in this system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Database of graph objects -> Feature generation (CSV table) -> Linear optimization (inequality generation) -> Theo heuristic -> Dalmation-static heuristic -> Output conjectures
- Critical path: Feature generation -> Linear optimization -> Theo filtering -> Dalmation-static filtering -> Output
- Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes generality and sharpness over completeness, meaning it may miss specific but interesting conjectures in favor of more broadly applicable ones
- Failure signatures: 
  - Too many trivial conjectures (indicates database needs refinement)
  - No conjectures generated (suggests insufficient variety in the database)
  - Only known conjectures (indicates need for larger or more diverse database)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run with a minimal database of 10-20 carefully selected graphs from graph theory literature to verify the basic pipeline works
  2. Add a Boolean property that splits the database into two distinct classes and observe how the conjectures change
  3. Test the Theo heuristic by creating two conjectures with the same inequality but different hypothesis generality to verify the filtering works correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can TxGraffiti's approach be extended to generate conjectures in other areas of mathematics beyond graph theory?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the feature generation process can work with any type of mathematical objects, not just graphs.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses primarily on graph theory applications, with limited discussion of potential extensions to other mathematical domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation and demonstration of TxGraffiti generating meaningful conjectures in other mathematical fields (e.g., number theory, topology).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the quality of conjectures be further improved by incorporating more sophisticated machine learning techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using linear optimization and supervised machine learning, but suggests there is room for improvement in conjecture quality.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore advanced ML techniques beyond basic linear optimization and supervised learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and comparison of different ML algorithms (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning) in generating and filtering conjectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical limit on the complexity of conjectures that TxGraffiti can generate?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the process of generating inequalities but doesn't address limitations on conjecture complexity.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on practical implementation rather than theoretical bounds on conjecture complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal analysis of the relationship between input data complexity and maximum conjecture complexity that can be generated.

## Limitations

- The exact implementation details of key components like the Theo heuristic and linear optimization objective function are not fully specified
- Quality and novelty of conjectures appear heavily dependent on the underlying graph database composition
- Claims about generating publishable research lack comprehensive systematic validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (⭐⭐⭐⭐): The overall architecture and workflow of TxGraffiti - combining linear optimization with heuristic filtering to generate graph theory conjectures - is well-established and technically sound. The conceptual framework is clearly articulated.

**Medium Confidence** (⭐⭐⭐): The effectiveness of the Theo and Dalmation-static heuristics in improving conjecture quality is supported by results but lacks detailed empirical validation. The mechanisms appear reasonable but their relative contributions aren't rigorously quantified.

**Low Confidence** (⭐): Claims about the system's ability to generate publishable research are based on anecdotal evidence rather than systematic evaluation. The paper doesn't provide metrics for measuring conjecture quality or significance.

## Next Checks

1. **Database Sensitivity Analysis**: Test TxGraffiti with systematically varied graph databases (different sizes, different graph families, different property combinations) to quantify how database composition affects conjecture novelty and quality.

2. **Baseline Comparison**: Implement a simpler baseline system using only linear optimization without heuristic filtering, then compare conjecture quality metrics to assess the actual contribution of Theo and Dalmation-static heuristics.

3. **Reproducibility Audit**: Attempt to reproduce a subset of the published conjectures using the described methodology, documenting any deviations from the paper's description and their impact on results.
