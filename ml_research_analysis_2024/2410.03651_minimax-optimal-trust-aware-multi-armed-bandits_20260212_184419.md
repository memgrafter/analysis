core_contribution: This paper studies trust-aware multi-armed bandits, where the learner's
  policy recommendations may not be fully implemented due to human trust issues. The
  authors establish that standard UCB algorithms can incur near-linear regret in this
  setting, and propose a two-stage trust-aware algorithm that achieves near-minimax
  optimal regret up to logarithmic factors.

# Minimax-optimal trust-aware multi-armed bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.03651
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03651
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves near-minimax optimal regret O(K√(H log K) + K^4 log²(H)) for trust-aware multi-armed bandits without requiring knowledge of trust parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses trust-aware multi-armed bandits where human trust affects implementation of recommended policies. Standard UCB algorithms can incur near-linear regret in this setting because humans may distrust the learner's recommendations and implement their own policies instead. The authors propose a two-stage algorithm that achieves near-minimax optimal regret up to logarithmic factors by adaptively identifying the trust set and performing trust-aware exploration-exploitation, without requiring knowledge of the implementer's trust level, trust set, or own policy.

## Method Summary
The approach consists of a two-stage algorithm: Stage 1 identifies the trust set by estimating which arms the human implementer trusts (those better than their own policy), and Stage 2 performs trust-aware exploration-exploitation using modified UCB updates that account for trust dynamics. The algorithm maintains trust levels and adjusts recommendations based on whether the implementer follows or deviates from suggestions. Key parameters include m=30K³log(H) for burn-in period and H₀=2mK for trust set identification, with regret bounded by O(K√(H log K) + K^4 log²(H)) when H is sufficiently large.

## Key Results
- Standard UCB incurs near-linear regret in trust-aware settings due to trust decay
- Proposed two-stage algorithm achieves near-minimax optimal regret bounds
- Algorithm works without knowledge of trust parameters, trust set, or implementer's policy
- Trust set identification enables efficient exploration while avoiding trust-destructive recommendations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm exploits the key insight that trust dynamics can be managed through careful arm selection: by initially exploring to identify which arms the human trusts (those better than their own policy), the learner can then make recommendations within this trust set while avoiding arms that would trigger trust decay. The modified UCB updates account for potential deviations by incorporating trust-weighted reward estimates, ensuring that recommendations remain credible even when not fully implemented.

## Foundational Learning
- Trust-aware bandit formulation: Extends standard MAB to include trust dynamics where implementer may deviate from recommendations - needed for modeling real-world human-in-the-loop decision making
- Trust evolution models: Geometric decay (αₜ₊₁ = max{γαₜ, α₀δ}) captures how trust decreases with deviations - needed to quantify long-term impact of trust violations
- Confidence bounds with trust: UCB variants that incorporate trust-weighted estimates - needed to maintain optimism under partial implementation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Trust set identification -> Trust-aware UCB -> Regret minimization
Critical path: Human implementation (may deviate) -> Trust level update -> Algorithm recommendation adjustment -> Cumulative regret
Design tradeoffs: Exploration vs. trust preservation; accuracy of trust set identification vs. exploration cost; parameter-free design vs. performance
Failure signatures: Trust level decay to near zero; suboptimal arms dominating recommendations; trust set identification errors
First experiments:
1. Validate trust set identification accuracy on synthetic instances with known trust sets
2. Compare regret performance against theoretical upper bounds for different K values
3. Test robustness to misspecified trust evolution parameters through ablation studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Open Question 1: Can the trust-aware UCB algorithm achieve minimax optimality for all time horizons H, or is there a fundamental lower bound on H for which the algorithm becomes optimal? The paper states the algorithm is near-minimax optimal for H ≳ K^7 log^3(H) but doesn't address smaller H.

Open Question 2: Is the O(K^4 log²(H)) burn-in cost inherent to the trust issue or can it be reduced through algorithmic improvements? The paper acknowledges this cost but doesn't investigate its necessity or potential reduction.

Open Question 3: How would the trust-aware MAB framework extend to trust-aware reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs)? The paper discusses this as a future direction but doesn't explore the challenges.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees assume access to true trust set, which must be estimated in practice
- Algorithm performance depends on parameter choices (m=30K³log(H)) that may not be optimal across different trust dynamics
- Analysis focuses on specific geometric trust evolution models that may not capture all real-world trust dynamics

## Confidence
High confidence: Problem formulation and algorithm structure are clearly specified and reproducible
Medium confidence: Theoretical regret bounds hold under stated assumptions, though constants may vary
Low confidence: Trust set identification procedure's robustness to noise and approximation errors

## Next Checks
1. Validate trust set identification accuracy by testing on synthetic instances with known trust sets under varying noise levels
2. Compare Algorithm 1's regret performance against theoretical upper bounds across different K values and trust dynamics
3. Test algorithm robustness to misspecified trust evolution parameters (δ, γ) through ablation studies
