- TopoGCL achieves significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on 11 out of 12 datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Topological Graph Contrastive Learning (TopoGCL), the first approach to integrate persistent homology into graph contrastive learning. The method proposes extended persistence landscapes (EPL) as a new summary of extended persistence, proving its theoretical stability guarantees. TopoGCL employs a novel contrastive mode (topo-topo CL) that captures both local and global latent topological information through extended topological representations. Experimental results on 12 real-world graph datasets from biology, chemistry, and social sciences demonstrate that TopoGCL achieves significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on 11 out of 12 datasets. The method also exhibits robustness under noisy scenarios and delivers statistically significant improvements on 8 datasets.

## Method Summary
TopoGCL integrates extended persistent homology into graph contrastive learning through a two-branch architecture. The first branch performs traditional graph contrastive learning using a GNN encoder, while the second branch captures topological features through extended persistence landscapes (EPL) and extended persistence images (EPI). The model uses multi-filtration with centrality-based functions (degree, betweenness, closeness, subgraph) to generate multiple extended persistence diagrams. These are converted to vector representations and processed through extended topological layers. The method is trained end-to-end using Adam optimizer with hyperparameter tuning over α, β ∈ {0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0} and Q ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} filtration functions, with the final objective combining graph and topological contrastive losses.

## Key Results
- TopoGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on 11 out of 12 real-world graph datasets
- The method delivers statistically significant improvements on 8 datasets with p-values < 0.01
- Extended persistence landscapes (EPL) provide stable topological representations with proven ∞-landscape distance guarantees
- Multi-filtration approach using centrality measures enhances robustness and captures comprehensive topological features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Extended persistence landscapes (EPL) are more stable than ordinary persistence summaries for shape matching.
- Mechanism: EPL maps extended persistence diagrams to a functional Hilbert space, enabling ℓp-norm distance calculations that are provably stable under ∞-landscape distance.
- Core assumption: The piecewise linear structure of EPL functions allows finite-dimensional representation of infinite lifespans without loss of critical topological information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a new extended persistence summary, namely, extended persistence landscapes (EPL) and derive its theoretical stability guarantees."
  - [section] "Proposition 0.3 (Stability of EPL). Let EDg1 and EDg2 be EPDs for the piecewise linear functions f, g : K → R respectively, then their corresponding ∞-landscape distance satisfies Λ∞(EDg1, EDg2) ≤ dB(EDg1, EDg2) ≤ ∥f − g∥∞."
- Break condition: If the piecewise linear approximation introduces significant distortion in the lifespan representation, stability guarantees fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Topological-topological contrastive learning (topo-topo CL) captures both local and global latent topological information better than traditional CL modes.
- Mechanism: By contrasting extended topological representations of two augmented views from the same graph, topo-topo CL enforces invariance under continuous transformations while maximizing mutual information across multiple resolution scales.
- Core assumption: Extended persistence captures shape properties invariant under continuous transformations like bending, stretching, and twisting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our extensive numerical results on biological, chemical, and social interaction graphs show that the new Topological Graph Contrastive Learning (TopoGCL) model delivers significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification for 11 out of 12 considered datasets"
  - [section] "TopoGCL is the first approach introducing the concepts of persistent homology to graph contrastive learning."
- Break condition: If the augmentation pipeline destroys topological features essential for the task, the contrastive objective loses meaning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-filtration approach improves robustness by capturing topological features from different perspectives.
- Mechanism: Using Q sublevel filtration functions based on different centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, subgraph) generates multiple extended persistence diagrams that complement each other's blind spots.
- Core assumption: Different centrality measures highlight different aspects of graph topology, making the combined representation more comprehensive.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To gain a better understanding of the complex representations of graph data, instead of a single filtration, we hypothesize that learning topological representations via multiple filtrations can benefit neural network framework in gaining both generalization and robustness."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found for this specific multi-filtration hypothesis.
- Break condition: If the filtrations are highly correlated, the computational overhead provides no additional discriminative power.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Extended persistence diagrams (EPD)
  - Why needed here: EPDs capture both sublevel and superlevel filtrations, ensuring all topological features have finite lifespans suitable for machine learning input.
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between ordinary persistence diagrams and extended persistence diagrams regarding feature lifespans?

- Concept: Piecewise linear functions in topological summaries
  - Why needed here: EPL represents persistence diagrams as sets of piecewise linear functions, enabling efficient vectorization and distance computation.
  - Quick check question: How many points are needed to completely determine a kth landscape function in EPL?

- Concept: Stability guarantees in topological data analysis
  - Why needed here: Stability ensures that small perturbations in the input graph lead to small changes in the topological representation, making the contrastive learning objective meaningful.
  - Quick check question: What distance metric bounds the ∞-landscape distance between two EPLs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input graphs → Data augmentation (T, T') → GNN encoder (fENCODER) → Graph representations (H, H') + Extended persistence extractor (Ω) → Extended topological features (Ξ, Ξ') → Extended topological layer (Ψ) → Topological representations (Z, Z') → Contrastive losses (ℓG, ℓT) → Combined objective (ℓ)
- Critical path: The topological representation learning path (augmentation → extended persistence → topological layer) must execute efficiently since it adds overhead to the standard GCL pipeline.
- Design tradeoffs: EPL vs EPI - EPL is more computationally efficient but EPI may capture certain topological patterns better. The choice affects both runtime and potential accuracy.
- Failure signatures: If EPL generation fails to capture meaningful topological features, the topo-topo CL loss becomes uninformative. If the GNN encoder overfits to augmented views, contrastive learning collapses.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify EPL generation on a simple graph (e.g., cycle graph) produces expected piecewise linear functions and correct lifespans.
  2. Compare topo-topo CL loss behavior with and without augmentation to ensure the contrastive objective is meaningful.
  3. Test multi-filtration performance on a small dataset by incrementally adding centrality-based filtrations and measuring classification accuracy changes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do stability guarantees for extended persistence landscapes (EPL) compare to those of extended persistence images (EPI) under different topological perturbations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper derives stability guarantees for EPL using the ∞-landscape distance and notes that EPI stability is only known for the 1-Wasserstein distance, with no formal stability results established for EPI under extended persistence.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical properties of EPI under extended persistence remain unexplored, and no formal comparison between EPL and EPI stability exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof of stability for EPI under extended persistence, and a direct comparison of perturbation robustness between EPL and EPI.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of sublevel filtration functions (e.g., degree, betweenness, closeness) affect the performance of TopoGCL across different graph domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses multiple filtration functions and finds node betweenness- and closeness-based filtrations are most important, but does not systematically analyze how different combinations affect performance across domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on optimal combinations via cross-validation but does not explore domain-specific effects or provide a comprehensive analysis of filtration function impact.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying filtration functions across multiple graph domains (e.g., biological, social, chemical) with detailed performance comparisons.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can TopoGCL be extended to dynamic or time-evolving graphs while maintaining its topological contrastive learning benefits?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The conclusion mentions this as a future direction, and the paper focuses on static graphs, implying unexplored potential for temporal graph analysis.
- Why unresolved: The current framework is designed for static graphs, and no mechanism for handling temporal dynamics or streaming data is provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of TopoGCL to dynamic graphs with experimental validation on temporal datasets, showing maintained or improved performance.

## Limitations
- The computational overhead of extended persistence computation (O(n³) worst case) may limit scalability to large graphs
- Stability guarantees for extended persistence images (EPI) remain unproven under extended persistence
- Multi-filtration approach adds computational complexity without systematic analysis of filtration function impact across domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The experimental methodology is rigorous, with proper statistical validation across 12 datasets and clear significance testing. The theoretical stability proof for EPL appears sound given the mathematical foundations cited.

**Medium Confidence**: The performance improvements are substantial (11/12 datasets), but the comparison against relatively few baseline methods and lack of ablation studies on the multi-filtration approach reduce confidence in the claimed superiority.

**Low Confidence**: The computational complexity analysis is incomplete, and the paper doesn't address practical limitations for large-scale graphs or real-time applications.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Multi-Filtration**: Systematically evaluate performance when using individual centrality-based filtrations (degree, betweenness, closeness, subgraph) versus the combined approach to quantify the actual contribution of multi-filtration.

2. **Scalability Benchmark**: Test TopoGCL on larger graph datasets (e.g., OGB benchmarks) to measure the computational overhead and determine practical limits of the extended persistence computation.

3. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments with varying noise levels in graph structure and node features to validate the claimed robustness, particularly focusing on when topological features become unreliable versus when they provide the most benefit.
