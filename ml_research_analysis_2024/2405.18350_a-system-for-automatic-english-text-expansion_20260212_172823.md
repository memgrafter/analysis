# A System for Automatic English Text Expansion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.18350
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18350
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: The system achieves 72.23% success rate in automatically generating correct sentences from minimal input words

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an automatic English text expansion system that generates complete sentences from minimal input words. The system combines linguistic rules with statistical approaches, using a modular architecture that can be adapted to other languages. The core method involves a lexicon (aLexiE) built from multiple linguistic resources, a grammar for syntactic structuring, and a two-stage processing pipeline (Sentence Planner and Surface Realiser) that adds necessary elements and applies morphological inflections. The system was evaluated using a widely used NLG corpus and an ad-hoc Spanish-English parallel corpus, achieving a 72.23% success rate in automatically generating correct sentences.

## Method Summary
The system uses a hybrid approach combining linguistic rules with statistical methods. It employs a comprehensive lexicon (aLexiE) that merges entries from EnLex, NIH, and Freeling dictionaries, augmented with semantic information from MCR and FrameNet. A grammar defined as a Definite-Clause Grammar (DCG) handles syntactic structuring. The two-stage pipeline first configures sentence structure and adds necessary elements (Sentence Planner), then applies morphological inflections and produces final output (Surface Realiser). The system can handle various sentence types including affirmative, negative, and interrogative forms.

## Key Results
- 72.23% success rate in automatically generating correct sentences
- 70.25% full match between target and generated sentences
- Good inter-annotator agreement (Alpha 0.582, Accuracy 0.691) in manual evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system automatically generates complete, grammatically correct sentences from minimal input words by combining linguistic rules with statistical approaches.
- Mechanism: The architecture uses a two-stage pipeline where the Sentence Planner configures sentence structure using a grammar, and the Surface Realiser applies morphological inflections and inserts necessary elements like prepositions and determiners. The aLexiE lexicon provides comprehensive morphological, syntactic, and semantic information that enables this process.
- Core assumption: The input words are meaningful (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and can be processed to generate coherent sentences when combined with the system's linguistic knowledge base.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combines linguistic rules with statistical approaches" and "generates coherent and correct sentences from a minimum set of words"
  - [section III-C]: Detailed description of the two-stage pipeline (Sentence Planner and Surface Realiser) and how they work together
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus doesn't directly provide evidence for the mechanism's effectiveness, though it shows related work
- Break condition: The system would fail if the input words lack sufficient semantic content, if the grammar cannot parse the intended structure, or if the lexicon lacks necessary entries for the input words.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The system can adapt to different languages and domains through its modular architecture.
- Mechanism: The design separates domain-dependent components (grammar and lexica) from domain-independent components (NLG surface realiser). This allows easy replacement of language-specific resources while maintaining the core generation pipeline.
- Core assumption: The modular design effectively isolates language-specific requirements, allowing the same core algorithm to work across different languages with appropriate resource substitution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "design is modular and adaptable to other languages" and "can be tailored to different applications and domains"
  - [section II]: Discussion of how most NLG systems are purpose-built but this system's modularity allows isolation of domain-dependent modules
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in the corpus, though it shows the system has been evaluated for both English and Spanish
- Break condition: The modular approach would fail if language-specific components are too deeply intertwined with the core system, or if the separation between domain-dependent and independent components is not properly maintained.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The system achieves high accuracy in sentence generation through comprehensive lexicon coverage and intelligent preposition inference.
- Mechanism: The aLexiE lexicon combines multiple linguistic resources (EnLex, NIH, Freeling) and adds semantic classification using MCR and FrameNet. The system uses statistical language modeling on trigrams to infer appropriate prepositions based on verb semantics and noun categories.
- Core assumption: Comprehensive lexicon coverage and statistical preposition inference significantly improve generation accuracy compared to systems without these features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-A]: Detailed description of aLexiE creation from multiple resources and the automatic extension process for preposition inference
  - [section IV-A]: Statistics showing the size and coverage of the merged lexicon
  - [section IV-B1]: Evaluation results showing 72.23% success rate in automatic generation
- Break condition: The system would fail if the lexicon coverage is insufficient for the input domain, if the statistical preposition model is inaccurate, or if semantic classification doesn't align with actual usage patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and Definite-Clause Grammars (DCGs)
  - Why needed here: The system uses DCGs to parse input words and generate appropriate syntactic structures for sentence generation
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Context-Free Grammar and a Definite-Clause Grammar, and why would DCGs be more suitable for this natural language generation task?

- Concept: Morphological analysis and inflection
  - Why needed here: The Surface Realiser applies morphological inflections to generate grammatically correct sentences, adjusting person, number, gender, and tense based on the input words and sentence context
  - Quick check question: How does the system determine which morphological features to apply to a given word, and what information from the lexicon is used in this decision?

- Concept: Statistical language modeling for preposition inference
  - Why needed here: The system uses trigram language models trained on Wikipedia to infer appropriate prepositions based on verb semantics and noun categories
  - Quick check question: What type of language model is used for preposition inference, and how does it incorporate semantic information from the lexicon?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input words -> Lemmatization and feature extraction -> Sentence Planner -> Grammar parsing -> Extra elements addition -> Surface Realiser -> Morphological inflections -> Final sentence

- Critical path:
  1. Input words are lemmatized and features are extracted
  2. Sentence Planner detects sentence type and configures structure
  3. Grammar is used to find appropriate syntactic trees
  4. Extra elements (prepositions, determiners) are added
  5. Surface Realiser applies morphological inflections
  6. Final sentence is generated

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Modularity vs. integration: The modular design allows language adaptation but may introduce complexity
  - Automatic vs. manual: Full automation reduces user effort but may sacrifice some control
  - Coverage vs. precision: Comprehensive lexicon coverage improves accuracy but increases system complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Missing prepositions or determiners in output
  - Incorrect morphological inflections (wrong tense, number, or person)
  - Syntactically incorrect sentence structures
  - Inability to generate output for certain input word combinations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic sentence generation with simple SVO inputs (e.g., "she look picture")
  2. Test preposition inference with different verb-noun combinations (e.g., "look picture" vs "look dog")
  3. Test morphological inflection with different subject types (pronouns, nouns, coordinated subjects)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the system perform with AAC users in real-world applications, particularly regarding usability and user satisfaction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the potential for evaluating the system with AAC users and references the broad community of their Pictodroid suite.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is based on corpus-based analysis and manual annotations by NLG researchers, not actual AAC users.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies with AAC users, measuring effectiveness, efficiency, user satisfaction, and learning curves.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the system handle phrasal verbs and complex verb-preposition combinations in English text expansion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that phrasal verbs were a common mistake in the Spanish-English comparison, suggesting difficulty in detection.
- Why unresolved: While the system uses a language model to infer prepositions, the evaluation indicates this is not always accurate, especially for phrasal verbs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis focusing on phrasal verbs, and testing with datasets specifically designed to evaluate phrasal verb handling.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of the system when dealing with sentences that have complex syntactic structures or require deep semantic understanding?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the system can handle various sentence types and features, but the depth level is limited to two iterations to reduce computational load.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation corpus and manual annotation focus on relatively straightforward sentences, and the paper does not extensively explore the system's limitations with complex structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the system with datasets containing increasingly complex syntactic structures and evaluating its performance, identifying specific types of structures that pose challenges.

## Limitations

- Evaluation methodology is not fully specified, particularly regarding statistical significance testing and inter-annotator agreement procedures
- Lexicon coverage and quality may be insufficient for domain-specific vocabulary or rare words
- Limited evidence of generalization across different domains and text styles beyond the tested examples

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (Experimental evidence strongly supports these claims):
- The modular architecture design and its potential for language adaptation
- The two-stage pipeline (Sentence Planner and Surface Realiser) is functional and produces output
- The system can generate grammatically correct sentences from minimal input words

**Medium Confidence** (Results are promising but have limitations):
- The 72.23% success rate in automatic generation is based on a specific evaluation corpus
- The system's performance with prepositions and morphological inflections shows good results but may not generalize perfectly
- The inter-annotator agreement (Alpha 0.582, Accuracy 0.691) indicates moderate reliability but also suggests room for improvement

**Low Confidence** (Limited evidence or significant uncertainties):
- The system's performance with complex sentence structures beyond the tested examples
- How well the preposition inference mechanism works with verbs and nouns not in the training data
- The system's robustness to noisy or incomplete input

## Next Checks

**Check 1: Cross-Domain Evaluation** - Test the system on a different domain (e.g., medical texts, technical documentation, social media language) to assess generalization. Use the same evaluation metrics (success rate, full match percentage) to compare performance across domains.

**Check 2: Error Analysis and Failure Mode Investigation** - Conduct a detailed error analysis on the 27.77% of cases where generation failed. Categorize errors by type (missing prepositions, incorrect inflections, syntactic issues) and investigate whether certain word types or sentence patterns consistently cause failures.

**Check 3: Lexicon Coverage Assessment** - Measure the coverage of aLexiE for different word categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives) on a large, diverse corpus. Identify gaps in coverage and evaluate how often generation failures can be attributed to missing lexicon entries versus other system components.
