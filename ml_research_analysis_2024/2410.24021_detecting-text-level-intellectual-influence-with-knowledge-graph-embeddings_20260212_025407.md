# Detecting text level intellectual influence with knowledge graph embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.24021
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24021
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Novel method using knowledge graph embeddings to detect intellectual influence between academic articles, outperforming existing techniques in citation prediction

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel method for detecting intellectual influence between academic articles by leveraging knowledge graph embeddings generated from text using a large language model. The approach constructs knowledge graphs for each article and trains a Graph Convolutional Network to produce embeddings that capture both structural and semantic relationships. Evaluated on a corpus of 4,400 articles across diverse disciplines, the method outperforms existing techniques—including text reuse detection, topic modeling, and sentence embeddings—in predicting citations between articles, achieving a 0.61 area under the ROC curve and 0.55 F1 score. The results demonstrate that knowledge graph embeddings effectively encode argumentative and conceptual similarities, offering a promising avenue for analyzing latent intellectual connections in unstructured text.

## Method Summary
The method constructs knowledge graphs from academic articles by extracting entities, relationships, and argumentative structures using a large language model. These graphs are then processed through a Graph Convolutional Network to generate embeddings that capture both the structural topology and semantic content of the articles. The embeddings are used to predict citation relationships between articles, with the model trained on pairs of articles where one cites the other. The approach leverages the ability of knowledge graphs to represent complex relationships and the power of GCNs to learn meaningful representations from graph-structured data.

## Key Results
- Knowledge graph embeddings outperform text reuse detection, topic modeling, and sentence embeddings in predicting citations
- Achieved 0.61 AUC and 0.55 F1 score on a diverse corpus of 4,400 academic articles
- Demonstrated effectiveness in capturing argumentative and conceptual similarities between articles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by transforming unstructured text into structured knowledge graphs that capture entities, relationships, and argumentative structures. The Graph Convolutional Network then learns to encode these complex relationships into dense embeddings that preserve both the semantic meaning and structural properties of the original text. This allows the model to identify latent intellectual connections that may not be apparent through traditional text-based similarity measures.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Dense vector representations of knowledge graph structures that capture semantic and relational information
- Graph Convolutional Networks: Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data, learning node representations by aggregating information from neighbors
- Large Language Models for Entity Extraction: Using LLMs to identify and extract entities, relationships, and argumentative structures from unstructured text
- Citation Prediction: The task of predicting whether one academic article will cite another based on their content and relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Large Language Model -> Knowledge Graph Construction -> Graph Convolutional Network -> Embeddings -> Citation Prediction Model

**Critical Path:**
1. Text processing through LLM to extract entities and relationships
2. Knowledge graph construction from extracted information
3. GCN training to produce article embeddings
4. Citation prediction using learned embeddings

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Complexity vs. interpretability: Knowledge graphs provide rich representations but are harder to interpret than simpler text-based methods
- Computational cost: GCN training is more expensive than traditional embedding methods
- Generalizability: Method may be domain-specific due to reliance on academic article structures

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor entity extraction leading to incomplete knowledge graphs
- GCN overfitting on small datasets
- Embeddings failing to capture nuanced argumentative similarities

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare knowledge graph embeddings against baseline text similarity methods on citation prediction
2. Evaluate embedding quality using downstream tasks like topic classification
3. Test robustness by evaluating on articles from different disciplines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on a relatively small corpus of 4,400 articles, limiting generalizability
- Does not address potential biases introduced by the large language model or Graph Convolutional Network
- Performance in real-world citation prediction scenarios with noise and incomplete data remains untested

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The method's superiority over existing techniques (text reuse detection, topic modeling, sentence embeddings) in predicting citations is well-supported by the reported metrics

**Medium Confidence:**
- The claim that knowledge graph embeddings effectively encode argumentative and conceptual similarities is plausible but requires further validation with larger and more diverse datasets

**Low Confidence:**
- The generalizability of the approach to other domains or unstructured text beyond academic articles is speculative without additional testing

## Next Checks

1. **Scale-Up Evaluation:** Test the method on a significantly larger corpus (e.g., millions of articles) to assess scalability and robustness
2. **Cross-Domain Applicability:** Apply the approach to non-academic domains (e.g., news articles, patents) to evaluate its versatility
3. **Bias and Fairness Analysis:** Investigate potential biases in the large language model or Graph Convolutional Network that may affect the detection of intellectual influence across different disciplines or authorship groups
