# IndicVoices: Towards building an Inclusive Multilingual Speech Dataset for Indian Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.01926
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01926
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 7,348 hours of natural speech across 22 Indian languages, 16,237 speakers, 145 districts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces INDIC VOICES, a large-scale multilingual speech dataset covering 22 Indian languages with 7,348 hours of natural and spontaneous speech from 16,237 speakers across 145 districts. The dataset aims to address the underrepresentation of Indian languages in speech technology by providing diverse, inclusive data spanning various demographics, domains, and recording conditions. The authors present a comprehensive blueprint for large-scale data collection, including standardized protocols, engaging prompts, quality control mechanisms, and transcription guidelines. Using this dataset, they develop IndicASR, the first automatic speech recognition (ASR) model supporting all 22 languages listed in the 8th schedule of the Indian Constitution, achieving state-of-the-art performance. All data, tools, and models will be publicly released to foster research and development in Indian language speech technologies.

## Method Summary
The authors present a comprehensive approach to building a large-scale, inclusive multilingual speech dataset for Indian languages. The methodology involves standardized data collection protocols across 145 districts, engaging prompts to elicit natural speech, quality control mechanisms to ensure data consistency, and detailed transcription guidelines. The dataset covers 22 languages, 16,237 speakers, and 7,348 hours of speech, representing diverse demographics and recording conditions. Using this dataset, the authors develop IndicASR, an automatic speech recognition model supporting all 22 languages. The paper shares insights on scaling data collection efforts while maintaining quality and inclusivity across such a linguistically diverse region.

## Key Results
- 7,348 hours of natural and spontaneous speech data collected
- Coverage of 22 Indian languages, 16,237 speakers, and 145 districts
- Development of IndicASR, the first ASR model supporting all 22 languages listed in the 8th schedule of the Indian Constitution
- State-of-the-art ASR performance achieved using the INDIC VOICES dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of INDIC VOICES stems from its comprehensive approach to data collection that prioritizes inclusivity and diversity. By covering 22 languages, 16,237 speakers, and 145 districts, the dataset captures the linguistic and demographic diversity of India. The standardized protocols ensure consistency across data collection, while engaging prompts elicit natural speech patterns. Quality control mechanisms maintain data integrity, and detailed transcription guidelines enable accurate labeling. This holistic approach addresses the critical gap in speech technology resources for Indian languages, enabling the development of robust ASR models like IndicASR that can handle the complexities of multilingual speech recognition.

## Foundational Learning
- Multilingual speech data collection: Why needed - to support diverse Indian languages; Quick check - verify coverage of all 22 scheduled languages
- Quality control mechanisms: Why needed - to ensure data consistency across large-scale collection; Quick check - assess inter-annotator agreement scores
- Standardized transcription guidelines: Why needed - to maintain consistency in labeled data; Quick check - review sample transcriptions for adherence to guidelines
- Diverse speaker recruitment: Why needed - to capture demographic and regional variations; Quick check - analyze speaker distribution across age, gender, and regions
- Natural speech elicitation techniques: Why needed - to capture authentic language use patterns; Quick check - evaluate speech naturalness through acoustic analysis

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Collection -> Quality Control -> Transcription -> Model Training -> Evaluation

Critical path: The critical path involves collecting high-quality, diverse speech data, followed by rigorous quality control and transcription, which then feeds into training the IndicASR model. Evaluation across all 22 languages ensures the model's effectiveness and identifies areas for improvement.

Design tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff involves balancing the scale of data collection with quality control measures. While collecting data from 16,237 speakers across 145 districts ensures diversity, it also presents challenges in maintaining consistency. The authors address this through standardized protocols and quality control mechanisms, but this may limit spontaneity in some recordings. Another tradeoff is between the breadth of language coverage (22 languages) and the depth of data for each language, which could impact model performance for less-represented languages.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include inconsistent transcription quality across languages, underrepresentation of certain dialects or socio-economic groups, and performance degradation for languages with limited training data. The model may also struggle with code-switching or mixed-language speech, which is common in multilingual regions like India.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate transcription quality by comparing a sample of transcribed speech against original recordings
2. Assess speaker diversity by analyzing demographic distribution across age, gender, and regions
3. Test model performance on code-switched speech to identify limitations in handling mixed-language inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, it implicitly raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the data collection pipeline, potential biases in prompt selection and speaker recruitment, and the need for continuous updates to the dataset to capture evolving language use patterns.

## Limitations
- Potential underrepresentation of certain dialects or socio-economic groups despite claims of inclusivity
- Limited information on the consistency of data collection implementation across different regions
- Lack of comparative benchmarks against other ASR models on the same dataset, making independent verification challenging
- No discussion of potential biases in prompt selection or speaker recruitment that could impact dataset representativeness

## Confidence
- Dataset scale and coverage: High
- Data collection methodology: Medium
- ASR model performance claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent evaluation of the IndicASR model using standardized benchmarks across all 22 languages to verify state-of-the-art claims.
2. Perform a comprehensive demographic analysis of the dataset to assess the actual distribution of speakers across different socio-economic backgrounds and regions.
3. Evaluate the transcription quality and consistency across different languages and recording conditions using a sample of annotated speech segments.
