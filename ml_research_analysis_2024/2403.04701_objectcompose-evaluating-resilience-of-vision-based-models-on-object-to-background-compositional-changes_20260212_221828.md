# ObjectCompose: Evaluating Resilience of Vision-Based Models on Object-to-Background Compositional Changes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04701
- Reference count: 40
- Modern vision models exhibit significant performance drops when exposed to object-to-background compositional changes

## Executive Summary
ObjectCompose introduces a method for evaluating vision model resilience to object-to-background context variations by generating diverse, realistic background changes while preserving object semantics. The approach leverages segmentation and captioning models to guide a diffusion model in creating natural and adversarial backgrounds. Experiments on ImageNet and COCO datasets show that modern vision models exhibit significant performance drops when exposed to background variations, with adversarial backgrounds causing the largest decline. The method offers a robust benchmark for assessing model robustness and generalization across diverse tasks.

## Method Summary
ObjectCompose uses segmentation (SAM) and captioning (BLIP-2) models to generate object masks and descriptions that guide a diffusion model in creating background variations. The method preserves object semantics while introducing natural, color, texture, and adversarial background changes. It evaluates model performance on modified versions of ImageNet and COCO datasets, measuring resilience across classification, detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks.

## Key Results
- Vision models show average 13.64% performance drop on classifier models with diverse backgrounds
- Adversarial background changes cause substantial 68.71% performance drop
- Object detection and segmentation models demonstrate better robustness than classification models due to their incorporation of object-to-background context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The ObjectCompose method preserves object semantics by using segmentation masks and object captions as conditioning inputs to the diffusion model. FastSAM generates precise object masks from class labels, while BLIP-2 creates captions describing the object. These conditioning inputs ensure background edits preserve object semantics during generation.

### Mechanism 2
The method generates both natural and adversarial background changes by modifying textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embeddings of the text-to-image model. Natural changes use prompt modifications, while adversarial changes employ discriminative models to maximize loss through latent and embedding optimization.

### Mechanism 3
ObjectCompose evaluates vision model resilience by generating datasets with varied backgrounds and testing model performance. The method applies background changes to ImageNet and COCO subsets, then compares model performance on modified versus original datasets to quantify resilience to compositional variations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Used to generate diverse background changes while preserving object semantics
  - Quick check question: How do diffusion models work, and what are their key components?

- Concept: Segmentation and image captioning models
  - Why needed here: Generate object masks and captions used as conditioning inputs to diffusion model
  - Quick check question: How do segmentation and image captioning models work, and what are their key components?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks and robustness
  - Why needed here: Generate adversarial background changes to evaluate model robustness
  - Quick check question: What are adversarial attacks, and how can they be used to evaluate model robustness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: FastSAM -> BLIP-2 -> Diffusion model -> Vision models
- Critical path: Generate object masks and captions → Use as conditioning inputs → Generate background changes → Optimize for adversarial changes → Evaluate vision models
- Design tradeoffs: Segmentation/captioning conditioning may limit background diversity; adversarial optimization may produce unrealistic changes
- Failure signatures: Inaccurate object masks/captions prevent proper object preservation; diffusion model cannot generate diverse changes; optimization fails to create adversarial backgrounds
- First 3 experiments: 1) Generate masks and captions on ImageNet/COCO subsets, 2) Create background changes using diffusion model, 3) Optimize for adversarial changes and evaluate vision models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do models trained with object-background context priors perform compared to standard models under diverse object-to-background compositional changes? The paper observes better robustness in detection/segmentation models but lacks direct comparisons with models trained using explicit object-background context priors.

### Open Question 2
Can adversarial training methods be extended to improve robustness against non-adversarial background variations? While adversarially trained models show limited robustness beyond adversarial perturbations, the paper doesn't explore modifying adversarial training to address natural background changes.

### Open Question 3
How does object size and semantic complexity affect model vulnerability to background changes? The paper mentions challenges with small objects but doesn't systematically analyze the impact of object size and complexity on performance under background variations.

## Limitations
- Method's dependence on accurate segmentation and captioning models introduces potential error propagation
- Trade-off between background diversity and object preservation not fully explored
- Results may not fully generalize to real-world scenarios due to controlled dataset generation

## Confidence
- High confidence in core methodology and experimental framework
- Medium confidence in generalizability to real-world scenarios
- Low confidence in robustness to variations in segmentation and captioning model performance

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate impact of segmentation and captioning model performance on generated background quality
2. Perform domain adaptation study to assess effectiveness in evaluating real-world object-to-background context variations
3. Investigate trade-off between background diversity and object preservation by varying conditioning strength during generation
