# Numerical Literals in Link Prediction: A Critical Examination of Models and Datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.18241
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18241
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Many link prediction models underutilize numerical literals, showing similar performance with original and random values, highlighting inadequate evaluation datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper critically examines the effectiveness of numerical literal incorporation in link prediction models for knowledge graphs. The authors identify a gap in existing evaluations: while models claim to use numerical literals, minor improvements on benchmark datasets raise doubts about their actual utilization. To address this, they propose a methodology involving a synthetic dataset where successful predictions require using numerical literals, and ablation strategies on existing datasets to assess literal relevance. Experiments with models like LiteralE, KBLN, MTKGNN, TransEA, and KGAT reveal that many underutilize literal information, often relying on additional parameters for performance gains. The authors conclude that existing datasets and models inadequately leverage numerical literals, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluations in future research.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a methodology to evaluate link prediction models that incorporate numerical literals through two main approaches: (1) a synthetic dataset where successful predictions require numerical literal values, using a binary classification setup based on literal thresholds, and (2) dataset ablation strategies including random literal replacement and relational triple removal to investigate whether literals provide unique information beyond graph structure. The methodology compares established models (LiteralE variants, KBLN, MTKGNN, TransEA, KGAT) using original versus random literal values, with evaluation metrics including accuracy for the synthetic dataset and MRR, MR, and Hits@k for real datasets.

## Key Results
- KGA models (using literal transformations) achieved high accuracy (>0.99) on the synthetic dataset, while other models showed scores close to random guessing (≈0.5)
- Ablation studies on real datasets (FB15k-237, YAGO3-10, LitWD48K) showed minimal performance differences between models using original vs. random literals
- The paper identifies that many models underutilize literal information and potentially rely on additional parameters for performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The synthetic dataset reveals underutilization of numerical literals by forcing models to use literal values for correct predictions
- Mechanism: The dataset design creates a scenario where only models incorporating literal values can achieve high accuracy, isolating the effect of literal usage from graph structure learning
- Core assumption: Models will attempt to use all available information in the dataset, and performance differences reflect actual utilization patterns rather than parameter effects
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We propose a methodology to evaluate LP models that incorporate numerical literals. We propose i) a new synthetic dataset to better understand how well these models use numerical literals"
- Break condition: If models achieve high performance on synthetic dataset through graph structure alone rather than literal values, the isolation mechanism fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ablation studies on existing datasets reveal whether numerical literals provide redundant information already encoded in relational triples
- Mechanism: By comparing model performance with original vs. random literals on existing datasets, we can detect whether literals add unique information or are redundant with graph structure
- Core assumption: If literals are redundant, models will perform similarly with random values as with original values; if literals add unique information, performance will degrade with random values
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ii) dataset ablations strategies to investigate potential difficulties with the existing datasets"
- Break condition: If random literal ablation shows performance differences unrelated to information redundancy (e.g., due to initialization effects), the mechanism fails

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The methodology isolates literal utilization effects from parameter addition effects by comparing models with and without literal incorporation
- Mechanism: By creating controlled experiments where only literal information differs, we can attribute performance differences specifically to literal utilization rather than model complexity
- Core assumption: Performance differences between models with and without literal incorporation on the same dataset reflect genuine utilization capabilities, not just parameter effects
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "many models underutilize literal information and potentially rely on additional parameters for performance gains"
- Break condition: If parameter count differences dominate performance regardless of literal usage, the isolation mechanism fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Link Prediction fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding standard LP evaluation metrics (MRR, Hits@k) and traditional models (TransE, DistMult) is essential for interpreting results and designing experiments
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between traditional LP models and those that incorporate numerical literals?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph embedding models and their extensions
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates multiple literal-aware models (LiteralE, KBLN, MTKGNN, TransEA, KGAT) with different incorporation strategies, requiring understanding of their mechanisms
  - Quick check question: How do fusion via scoring function and fusion via objective function approaches differ in incorporating literals?

- Concept: Dataset construction and evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: The synthetic dataset creation and ablation strategies are central to the paper's contribution, requiring understanding of controlled experimental design
  - Quick check question: Why does the synthetic dataset use a binary classification setup based on literal thresholds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Synthetic dataset generator -> Model training pipeline -> Evaluation metric calculators -> Analysis components

- Critical path: 1) Generate or prepare dataset with appropriate literal information, 2) Train models with and without literal features, 3) Evaluate using standard metrics (MRR, MR, Hits@k), 4) Analyze performance differences to draw conclusions about literal utilization

- Design tradeoffs: The synthetic dataset provides clean isolation but may not capture real-world complexity; ablation studies on real datasets are more realistic but noisier. The paper balances both approaches.

- Failure signatures: If all models perform similarly with random vs. real literals, the dataset may lack informative literals or models may not be learning to use them. If synthetic dataset performance doesn't correlate with real dataset performance, the synthetic setup may be too artificial.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and validate synthetic dataset generation with simple threshold-based classification
  2. Run baseline models (without literal incorporation) on both original and synthetic datasets to establish performance baselines
  3. Implement and test one literal-aware model (e.g., LiteralE) on synthetic dataset to verify it can utilize literals effectively

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the minimum complexity of synthetic learning goals required to reliably evaluate whether models utilize numerical literals beyond simple threshold comparisons?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their synthetic dataset implements "one simple learning goal" based on threshold comparisons and acknowledge this does not test more complex scenarios involving combining literal information with graph structure
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that simple threshold-based synthetic datasets can test basic literal utilization but leaves open what level of complexity would be needed to test more sophisticated reasoning capabilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing model performance on progressively more complex synthetic datasets (e.g., requiring multiple literals, temporal reasoning, or combined literal-graph structure reasoning) would show the threshold of complexity needed for meaningful evaluation

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do existing models truly fail to utilize numerical literals, or do the current benchmark datasets contain insufficient or improperly formatted literal information for effective learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The ablation studies show minimal performance differences between original and random literals, suggesting either models don't use literals effectively or the literals lack useful information. The authors note that 6.9% of FB15k-237 attributive triples contain database IDs that models cannot exploit
- Why unresolved: The paper cannot distinguish whether poor literal utilization stems from model limitations or dataset inadequacies, as both explanations are consistent with the observed results
- What evidence would resolve it: Creating a benchmark dataset with carefully curated, high-quality numerical literals that are demonstrably relevant to link prediction tasks, then demonstrating significant performance improvements when models use these versus random values, would show whether the issue is with models or datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do GNN-based models that can process numerical literals as node features compare to the shallow models evaluated in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly exclude GNN models like R-GCN due to "absence of published research specifically advocating for these models' application in LP with numerical literal data," creating a gap in understanding how this model class performs
- Why unresolved: The paper's focus on shallow models leaves open whether more sophisticated architectures could better utilize numerical literals, as the evaluation framework wasn't applied to GNNs
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same evaluation methodology (synthetic datasets, ablation studies) to GNN models would reveal whether their neighborhood aggregation capabilities enable better literal utilization compared to the shallow models studied

## Limitations

- The synthetic dataset may oversimplify real-world KG link prediction tasks, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings
- Ablation studies may be affected by confounding factors such as entity distribution and initialization effects not fully controlled
- The paper cannot definitively distinguish whether poor literal utilization stems from model limitations or dataset inadequacies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that many models underutilize numerical literals and show similar performance with original vs. random values is well-supported by the ablation experiments and synthetic dataset results
- **Medium Confidence**: The conclusion about the inadequacy of existing datasets for evaluating literal incorporation has strong empirical support but may not generalize to all KG datasets or domains
- **Low Confidence**: The specific mechanism by which models fail to utilize literals (e.g., parameter effects vs. architectural limitations) remains partially speculative and requires further investigation

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic Dataset Complexity Extension**: Create more sophisticated synthetic datasets with multi-dimensional numerical thresholds and non-linear relationships to test whether current models can handle more complex literal-based reasoning

2. **Controlled Parameter Ablation**: Implement a parameter-controlled experiment where models with identical parameter counts are compared (one with literal incorporation, one without) to isolate the literal utilization effect from model complexity

3. **Domain Transfer Analysis**: Test the same models and methodology on domain-specific KGs with well-established numerical relationships (e.g., scientific KGs with chemical properties) to validate whether the underutilization pattern holds across different knowledge domains
