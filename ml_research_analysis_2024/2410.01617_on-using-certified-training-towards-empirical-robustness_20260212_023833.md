# On Using Certified Training towards Empirical Robustness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.01617
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01617
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Certified training algorithms can improve empirical adversarial robustness when tuned appropriately, preventing catastrophic overfitting in single-step attacks and matching multi-step baselines under certain conditions.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores whether certified training methods, originally designed for formal robustness guarantees, can enhance empirical adversarial robustness. The authors investigate expressive loss functions and a new regularization technique called ForwAbs that control network over-approximations while preserving key components of adversarial training. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, they demonstrate that expressive losses can prevent catastrophic overfitting in single-step attacks when properly tuned for empirical robustness. The ForwAbs regularizer achieves similar effects at reduced computational cost. Results show that certified training approaches can bridge the gap to multi-step methods on shallower networks and with longer training schedules, though limitations remain on harder datasets.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two main approaches to leverage certified training for empirical robustness. First, they study expressive loss functions that can be tuned to optimize for empirical rather than certified robustness, preventing catastrophic overfitting in single-step adversarial training. Second, they introduce ForwAbs, a regularization term that bounds forward abstraction error during training. The method maintains the core structure of adversarial training while adding these certified-training-inspired components. The key insight is that controlling network over-approximations during training can improve robustness even when formal guarantees aren't the primary goal. Experiments compare these approaches against standard multi-step adversarial training baselines across different network depths and training schedules.

## Key Results
- Expressive losses prevent catastrophic overfitting in single-step attacks when tuned for empirical robustness
- ForwAbs regularization achieves similar robustness improvements at lower computational cost
- Certified training approaches match or outperform multi-step baselines on shallower networks with longer schedules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on controlling network over-approximations during training. By bounding the abstraction error in forward passes, the network learns to maintain robustness properties that transfer to empirical adversarial examples. The expressive losses prevent the network from exploiting loopholes in single-step attacks by ensuring the learned robust features generalize beyond the immediate perturbation space. ForwAbs regularization specifically targets the forward abstraction error, forcing the network to maintain consistent behavior under perturbations. This approach effectively regularizes the learning process in a way that benefits both certified and empirical robustness, though the primary focus is on the latter.

## Foundational Learning
- **Certified training basics**: Understanding how formal robustness guarantees are computed through over-approximations. Why needed: Provides context for why controlling abstractions helps empirical robustness. Quick check: Can explain the difference between empirical and certified robustness.
- **Adversarial training paradigms**: Knowledge of single-step vs multi-step attack methods. Why needed: The paper directly compares these approaches and their failure modes. Quick check: Can describe catastrophic overfitting in single-step attacks.
- **Over-approximation bounds**: Understanding how abstract domains bound network behavior. Why needed: Core to how ForwAbs and expressive losses function. Quick check: Can explain what forward abstraction error measures.
- **Empirical vs certified metrics**: Distinction between provable guarantees and test-time robustness. Why needed: The paper bridges these two evaluation frameworks. Quick check: Can list key differences in how these are measured.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input -> Expressive Loss Layer -> Network Forward Pass -> ForwAbs Regularization -> Loss Computation -> Parameter Update

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves computing the expressive loss with over-approximation bounds, applying ForwAbs regularization to control forward abstraction error, and backpropagating through these components. The key innovation is integrating these certified-training elements into standard adversarial training loops without disrupting the core optimization process.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The main tradeoff is between computational cost and robustness gains. Expressive losses and ForwAbs add overhead compared to standard adversarial training, though ForwAbs specifically aims to reduce this burden. Another tradeoff is between network depth and effectiveness - shallower networks benefit more from these approaches, suggesting potential scalability limitations.

**Failure Signatures**
Failure occurs when the over-approximation bounds become too loose, allowing the network to exploit gaps between abstract and concrete behavior. This manifests as degraded performance on harder datasets or with deeper architectures. Catastrophic overfitting in single-step attacks also indicates the expressive losses weren't properly tuned.

**First Experiments**
1. Replicate single-step adversarial training with expressive losses on CIFAR-10 to verify catastrophic overfitting prevention
2. Implement ForwAbs regularization and compare computational overhead against baseline methods
3. Test deeper network architectures to assess scalability limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the scalability of certified training approaches to larger datasets and deeper architectures. They note uncertainty about whether the observed benefits transfer to real-world deployment scenarios and how these methods perform against adaptive attacks specifically designed to exploit over-approximation gaps. The relationship between training schedule length and effectiveness also remains an open question, particularly for practical applications with limited training time.

## Limitations
- Results are primarily validated on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with limited testing on harder datasets
- Effectiveness decreases with network depth, suggesting scalability limitations
- Computational overhead remains a concern despite ForwAbs optimizations
- Reliance on single-step adversarial training as primary baseline may limit generalizability

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Expressive losses can prevent catastrophic overfitting in single-step attacks when tuned for empirical robustness.

**Medium confidence**: ForwAbs regularization achieves similar robustness effects at reduced computational cost, but effectiveness varies with network depth.

**Low confidence**: Certified training can fully bridge the gap to multi-step methods on all datasets and architectures.

## Next Checks

1. Test expressive losses and ForwAbs on deeper networks (e.g., ResNet-50) and larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet) to assess scalability.

2. Compare certified training approaches against adaptive attacks that specifically target over-approximation gaps.

3. Evaluate the transfer of robustness gains to out-of-distribution data and real-world adversarial scenarios.
