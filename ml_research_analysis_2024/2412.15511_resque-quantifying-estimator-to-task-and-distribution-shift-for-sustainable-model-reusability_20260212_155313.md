# RESQUE: Quantifying Estimator to Task and Distribution Shift for Sustainable Model Reusability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15511
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: RESQUE predicts model retraining costs (epochs, energy, carbon) from single forward passes, enabling sustainable model reuse decisions

## Executive Summary
RESQUE is a predictive quantifier that estimates the retraining cost of deep learning models when facing distributional shifts or task changes. The method provides a single concise index to gauge the resources required for model adaptation before retraining begins. Through extensive experiments across various datasets, noise types, and target tasks, RESQUE demonstrates strong correlation with retraining measures such as epochs, gradient norms, parameter changes, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. The approach is validated for both convolutional networks and vision transformers, showing consistent effectiveness in enabling sustainable model reuse decisions.

## Method Summary
RESQUE computes two types of estimators: RESQUEdist for distribution shifts and RESQUEtask for task changes. For distribution shifts, it calculates normalized embedding vectors for each class and measures the average inverse cosine angle between original and shifted distributions. For task changes, it performs one retraining epoch, clusters the resulting representations, and computes the complement of Adjusted Rand Index between cluster assignments and true labels. The method requires only forward propagation without backpropagation, making it computationally efficient while maintaining strong correlation with actual retraining costs.

## Key Results
- RESQUE shows strong correlation with retraining measures including epochs, gradient norms, parameter changes, energy consumption, and carbon emissions
- The method works consistently across both convolutional networks and vision transformers
- RESQUE enables practitioners to make informed, sustainable decisions about model reuse by quantifying adaptation costs before retraining begins

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RESQUE estimates the angular distance between class-wise representation centroids in the embedding space to quantify distributional shift
- Mechanism: For each class, the method computes a summed embedding vector from all samples, normalizes it, and then averages the inverse cosine angle between the original and shifted class vectors
- Core assumption: The normalized summed embedding vectors preserve class-wise discriminative information and their angular separation correlates with retraining difficulty
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "measures the shift in the model's representation outputs between the original and new distribution"; [section] "RESQUEdist is then obtained as, RESQUEdist = Pk i=0 arccos(V O i,norm, V S i,norm) k"
- Break condition: If the summed embedding does not capture sufficient discriminative variance, the angular measure may misrepresent the true shift

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: For task changes, RESQUE uses cluster label agreement (via Adjusted Rand Index complement) to measure class boundary separation in the representation space
- Mechanism: The method performs a single retraining epoch with the new task, clusters the resulting representations, and computes the complement of ARI between cluster assignments and true labels
- Core assumption: A single epoch is sufficient to update representations to include new-task features, and the cluster-label alignment after this update reflects the boundary separation needed for accurate prediction
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "quantifies the separation in class decision boundary of the new target task in the representation space"; [section] "Using the assigned cluster labels, we derive our estimator, RESQUEtask, by applying the Adjusted Rand Index"
- Break condition: If the single epoch fails to meaningfully incorporate new-task features, the cluster assignments may remain aligned with the old task

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lower RESQUE values correlate with reduced retraining resources because they reflect smaller representation divergence or better class boundary alignment
- Mechanism: Empirical experiments show that RESQUE strongly correlates with epochs, gradient norms, parameter change magnitude, energy, and carbon emissions
- Core assumption: The relationship between representation divergence/boundary separation and retraining effort holds consistently across architectures and datasets
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "RESQUE has a strong correlation with various retraining measures"; [section] "We show that RESQUE not only correlates with important sustainability costs such as energy consumption and carbon emissions"
- Break condition: If the architecture or dataset introduces systematic deviations, the correlation may weaken or reverse

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Normalized embedding vectors
  - Why needed here: They enable fair comparison of representation shifts across classes and datasets by removing magnitude effects
  - Quick check question: If two classes have the same representation direction but different magnitudes, what will their normalized vectors be?

- Concept: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and its complement
  - Why needed here: ARI measures clustering similarity; taking its complement aligns the metric with "low separation" (high RESQUEtask)
  - Quick check question: If cluster assignments perfectly match true labels, what is the complement of ARI?

- Concept: Cosine angle as a distance metric in high-dimensional embedding space
  - Why needed here: It captures angular separation, which is scale-invariant and meaningful for comparing representation directions
  - Quick check question: If two vectors point in the same direction, what is the cosine of the angle between them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Forward pass → Class-wise summed embedding → Normalization → Angle averaging (RESQUEdist); One-epoch retraining → Forward pass → KMeans clustering → ARI complement (RESQUEtask)
- Critical path: For distribution shift, the single forward pass dominates; for task change, the one-epoch retraining step is critical
- Design tradeoffs: Using summed embeddings reduces computation vs. per-sample analysis but may smooth out subtle shifts; using one epoch balances computational cost with adaptation quality
- Failure signatures: High RESQUE but low retraining cost may indicate representation smoothing; low RESQUE but high retraining cost may indicate task dissimilarity beyond representation space
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run RESQUEdist on CIFAR10 with Gaussian noise levels 1–10 and verify monotonic increase in the index
  2. Run RESQUEtask on CIFAR10→GTSRB task change and confirm correlation with retraining epochs
  3. Compare RESQUE estimates to actual retraining resource usage on a held-out noise level/task to validate prediction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does RESQUE perform on non-vision tasks such as natural language processing or time series data?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses exclusively on vision tasks (CNNs and Vision Transformers), with no evaluation on other domains
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states that RESQUE is model/architecture-agnostic, suggesting potential applicability to other domains, but no experiments or theoretical analysis are provided for non-vision tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying RESQUE to NLP models or time series models, comparing its correlation with retraining measures in these domains

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does RESQUE handle continuous distributional shifts rather than discrete noise levels?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates RESQUE against discrete noise levels (1-10) for image corruption types, but real-world distribution shifts may be continuous and gradual
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't address scenarios where distribution shifts occur incrementally over time, which would require sequential application of RESQUE or dynamic updating of the estimator
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing RESQUE's performance on datasets with continuous distribution shifts, such as gradual weather changes in satellite imagery

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational overhead of calculating RESQUE compared to the potential savings from informed retraining decisions?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that RESQUE requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation, but doesn't quantify the actual time or energy cost of this computation
- Why unresolved: While RESQUE is designed to reduce overall computational costs, the paper doesn't provide a cost-benefit analysis comparing the RESQUE computation overhead to the savings from avoiding unnecessary retraining
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed measurements of RESQUE computation time and energy consumption across different model sizes, compared to the potential savings in epochs and gradient computations

## Limitations
- The method's reliance on summed embedding vectors may obscure class-specific variations in highly imbalanced datasets
- The single-epoch retraining assumption for task changes may not hold for drastically different tasks
- Performance across architectures beyond ConvNets and ViTs remains unexplored

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core mechanism of using normalized embedding vectors and angular distance for distribution shift quantification
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of single-epoch retraining for task change quantification across all task pairs
- Medium confidence: The method's scalability and performance consistency across different model architectures and dataset types beyond those tested

## Next Checks
1. Test RESQUE on recurrent neural networks and transformers with different attention mechanisms to verify correlation patterns hold across diverse architectures
2. Evaluate RESQUE on datasets with severe class imbalance to determine if summed embeddings adequately capture representation shifts
3. Conduct experiments to determine the optimal number of retraining epochs needed for RESQUEtask to accurately reflect task change difficulty across various task similarity levels
