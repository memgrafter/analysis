# Optimizing Delegation in Collaborative Human-AI Hybrid Teams

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05605
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05605
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: RL-based manager can improve team performance by up to 187% compared to solo agents in driving scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for optimizing delegation in collaborative human-AI hybrid teams using a reinforcement learning-based manager. The core idea is to use the manager to select the best agent for control at critical points, minimizing the need for intervention while maximizing team performance. The manager observes only intervention states and delegates control to the most suitable agent based on learned policies. Experiments in a simulated driving scenario show that the manager can significantly improve team performance compared to the best solo agent in some cases.

## Method Summary
The method uses a reinforcement learning manager that learns to delegate control between agents based on intervention states and an episodic reward function. The manager is trained using Soft Actor-Critic with prioritized experience replay, pre-training on solo agent behavior samples. The system operates in a simulated driving environment with various perception contexts and agent behaviors, optimizing for task success while minimizing intervention frequency.

## Key Results
- Manager achieved up to 187% higher success rates compared to best solo agent in some scenarios
- Performance improvement over random manager baseline reached 10.8% in certain conditions
- Manager successfully handled teams with varying skill levels and perception capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The manager improves team performance by reducing the frequency of interventions while still achieving successful task completion.
- Mechanism: The manager learns a policy that selects the most suitable agent at critical points (constraint violations) based on observed performance and environment context. By minimizing interventions, the team benefits from fewer control handovers and smoother operation.
- Core assumption: The manager can accurately observe agent performance and environment context without needing access to private agent information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "minimizing the need for intervention while maximizing team performance"
  - [section 3.2] "our manager is instead learning to best reduce its need to be involved in the team operations"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The manager can handle diverse teams with varying skill levels and perception capabilities.
- Mechanism: The manager observes only intervention states and delegates control based on learned policies, without relying on agent-specific information. This allows the manager to support teams with agents that have different behavior models and perception abilities.
- Core assumption: Agents have already learned their own behavior models prior to joining the team, and the manager can estimate agent observations based on its own observations of the environment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "our manager is operating with teams of agents with previously trained behavior models"
  - [section 4.2] "We utilize various contexts to simulate degradation in perception... To generate a diverse set of driving agents"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The manager's use of constraints and an episodic reward function enables learning effective delegation policies.
- Mechanism: The manager uses constraints to indicate acceptable team behavior and cues interventions when these constraints are violated. The episodic reward function integrates cue costs and task outcomes to provide feedback for learning the optimal delegation policy.
- Core assumption: The manager can accurately model the likelihood of reaching intervention states based on the delegated agent's policy and the environment dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The failure of a constraint is then indicated by the manager's intervention function"
  - [section 4.3] "The manager will be equally concerned with speed relative to the current position on the road as well as the proximity to vehicles"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: The manager's learning problem is formulated as an MDP, where states represent the team's context, actions are the delegation decisions, and rewards are based on team performance and intervention frequency.
  - Quick check question: How does the MDP formulation allow the manager to learn an optimal delegation policy through interactions with the environment?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Why needed here: The manager uses RL techniques to learn the optimal delegation policy based on observed rewards. RL allows the manager to explore different delegation decisions and learn from the resulting outcomes.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the reward function in shaping the manager's learned policy, and how does the episodic reward function in this work differ from a step-based reward function?

- Concept: Absorbing Markov Chains (AMC)
  - Why needed here: The manager's perspective is modeled as an AMC, where intervention states are absorbing states. This allows the manager to model the likelihood of reaching intervention states based on the delegated agent's policy and the environment dynamics.
  - Quick check question: How does the AMC model simplify the manager's learning problem by focusing on intervention states rather than all possible states in the environment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Manager -> Agents -> Environment -> Constraints

- Critical path:
  1. Manager observes the environment context and agent performance.
  2. Manager makes a delegation decision when an intervention is cued.
  3. Delegated agent interacts with the environment based on its pre-trained behavior model.
  4. Manager observes the outcome and receives a reward based on the episodic reward function.
  5. Manager updates its policy based on the observed reward and continues learning.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Intervention frequency vs. team performance: The manager must balance the need for interventions with the goal of minimizing their frequency to avoid disrupting team operation.
  - Manager's observation scope: The manager observes only intervention states, which simplifies the learning problem but may miss important context for delegation decisions.
  - Agent diversity vs. manager's ability to handle diversity: The manager is designed to handle diverse teams, but the complexity of the team may impact the manager's ability to learn an effective policy.

- Failure signatures:
  - High intervention frequency: Indicates that the manager is not effectively selecting agents or that the agents' behavior models are not well-suited for the environment.
  - Low task completion rate: Suggests that the manager's learned policy is not effectively balancing team performance and intervention frequency.
  - Manager's inability to handle diverse teams: May occur if the team's complexity exceeds the manager's capacity to learn an effective policy.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the manager's performance in a simple environment with two agents of different skill levels and a clear "best" agent.
  2. Test the manager's ability to handle a team with agents that have varying perception capabilities and error-prone behavior.
  3. Assess the manager's performance in a more complex environment with multiple agents and a wider range of potential delegation decisions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper does not explicitly call out any open questions.

## Limitations
- Limited scope of experiments focusing on relatively simple driving scenarios with limited agent diversity
- Reliance on pre-trained agent behavior models constrains applicability to real-world settings
- Assumption that manager can accurately estimate agent observations may not hold in complex environments with partial observability

## Confidence
- Medium: The experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in tested driving scenarios, but limited scope and lack of comparison with alternative approaches reduce confidence in broader applicability.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the manager's performance in a more complex environment with multiple agents, diverse skill levels, and partial observability, to assess its ability to handle real-world team dynamics.
2. Compare the proposed framework against alternative delegation approaches, such as rule-based or model-based managers, to establish its relative effectiveness and identify potential areas for improvement.
3. Investigate the impact of the manager's observation scope on its learning performance, by gradually increasing the amount of information available to the manager and assessing the trade-off between learning efficiency and delegation effectiveness.
