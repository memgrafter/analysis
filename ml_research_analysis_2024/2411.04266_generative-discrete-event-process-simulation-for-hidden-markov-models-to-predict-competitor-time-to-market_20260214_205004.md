# Generative Discrete Event Process Simulation for Hidden Markov Models to Predict Competitor Time-to-Market

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.04266
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04266
- Reference count: 4
- Proposed method predicts competitor time-to-market by observing resource usage through generative PDES and HMM

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to predict when a competitor will bring a new product to market by observing their resource usage patterns. The approach uses a generative Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) model of the production process to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM learns to infer the current state of development from sequences of observed resource usage. Experiments with synthetic process models show that the HMM can predict the current development state with 70-80% accuracy after observing 20 days of resource usage in a 150-day process.

## Method Summary
The method combines generative PDES modeling with HMM training to predict competitor time-to-market. First, a PDES model of the product development process is created, capturing activities, dependencies, and resource requirements. This model generates synthetic execution traces showing resource usage over time. An HMM is then trained on these traces, where hidden states represent development stages and observations are resource usage patterns. During prediction, observed resource usage from a competitor is fed into the trained HMM to infer the current development stage and estimate time-to-market. The approach leverages the generative nature of PDES to create diverse training data that captures different execution paths and resource allocation scenarios.

## Key Results
- HMM predicts current development state with 70-80% accuracy after 20 days of observation in a 150-day process
- Prediction accuracy improves with more resources and denser activity dependency graphs
- Required observation length varies with process model structure, can be as low as 20 observations to reach 90% of maximum achievable accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning the probabilistic relationship between observed resource usage patterns and underlying development stages. The PDES model captures the complex dependencies and resource requirements of the development process, generating realistic execution traces. The HMM learns to map sequences of resource observations to hidden states representing progress through the development pipeline. This allows the model to infer current stage from partial observations and estimate remaining time based on typical transition patterns learned from the generative model.

## Foundational Learning
- **Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)**: Why needed - generates diverse execution traces for training. Quick check - can simulate different resource allocation scenarios and process variations.
- **Hidden Markov Models**: Why needed - learns probabilistic mapping from observations to hidden states. Quick check - can handle partial observability and sequence prediction tasks.
- **Resource Usage Patterns**: Why needed - observable proxy for development progress. Quick check - correlates with actual work completed in the process.
- **Process Dependency Graphs**: Why needed - captures workflow structure and constraints. Quick check - determines valid execution sequences and resource requirements.
- **State Inference**: Why needed - extracts current development stage from observations. Quick check - accuracy improves with more observation data and stronger correlations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
PDES Model -> Resource Usage Generator -> HMM Trainer -> Prediction Engine

**Critical Path:**
Process model definition → PDES execution → Resource trace generation → HMM training → Inference from observations

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Model complexity vs. training data requirements: more complex processes need more diverse traces
- Observation granularity vs. prediction accuracy: finer resource tracking improves inference
- HMM state granularity vs. overfitting: too many states can overfit to specific traces

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor accuracy with sparse observation data
- Overfitting to specific execution paths
- Difficulty inferring states when resource usage patterns overlap between stages

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Test HMM accuracy with varying observation window lengths
2. Evaluate performance across different process model complexities
3. Measure robustness to noise in resource usage observations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experiments use synthetic process models rather than real-world data
- Method focuses on specific class of processes with known structures
- Generalizability to arbitrary or unknown competitor processes is limited

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in core claims based on synthetic experiments
- Real-world applicability needs validation with actual product development data
- Performance may vary significantly with process complexity and observation quality

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to real-world product development data from public companies to verify performance on actual processes
2. Test prediction accuracy when process models are partially unknown or have structural variations
3. Evaluate robustness to noise and incomplete resource usage observations typical in real competitive intelligence scenarios
