# Determination of language families using deep learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.02393
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02393
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: c-GAN successfully classifies language families and shows possible Cypro-Minoan affinity with English

## Executive Summary
This study applies a convolutional generative adversarial network (c-GAN) to classify language families by analyzing transliterated text fragments. The approach converts text into 64×64 "fingerprints" and uses cosine-based pseudo-metrics to measure similarity between original and simulated fingerprints. When trained on six languages (English, Spanish, Tagalog, Finnish, Luwian, Hurrian, Babylonian), the classifier successfully grouped linguistically related languages and rejected unrelated ones. The method shows promise for both language classification and potential decipherment of undeciphered scripts like Cypro-Minoan.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a c-GAN to generate realistic "fingerprints" from text fragments, where the generator creates simulated arrays from random noise conditioned on training text, while the discriminator evaluates realism. The fingerprints are 64×64 arrays created through UTF-8 conversion of transliterated text. Cosine similarity measures the affinity between original and fake fingerprints, and logistic regression on trace and determinant invariants of the correlation matrix classifies language relationships into categories (no relationship, possible geographic relationship, linguistically related, linguistically related and contemporaneous).

## Key Results
- Successfully grouped linguistically related languages (English-Spanish, English-Tagalog) when trained on six language pairs
- Correctly identified Finnish as unrelated to five of six other languages in out-of-sample testing
- Suggested possible Cypro-Minoan affinity with English but not with other languages, though transliteration artifacts may explain this
- Demonstrated the approach works with limited sample sizes (1,500 characters per language)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: c-GAN generates realistic "fingerprints" of text fragments that encode structural patterns without requiring language comprehension
- Mechanism: The generator creates simulated arrays from random noise conditioned on training text, while the discriminator evaluates realism. Over iterations, the generator learns to produce arrays that statistically mimic the original text's structure, capturing phonetic and grammatical patterns as visual fingerprints
- Core assumption: Text structural patterns can be preserved and compared through 2D array transformations without semantic understanding
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "constructs 64×64 'fingerprints' from text samples and measures similarity between original and simulated fingerprints using cosine-based pseudo-metrics"
  - [section] "One chooses the datasets to compare as the training and test datasets... An entropic comparison measure determines whether a fake, built from random noise by a generator of the neural network, fits better one or the other dataset"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct comparison of fingerprint quality or fidelity metrics found in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If the 64×64 transformation loses critical linguistic features or if the c-GAN cannot learn meaningful patterns from small text samples

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cosine pseudo-metric effectively measures linguistic affinity between text fingerprints
- Mechanism: The cosine similarity between original and fake fingerprints quantifies how well the generator captured the training language's structure. Languages with similar structures produce higher similarity scores when trained on each other
- Core assumption: Structural similarity in fingerprint space correlates with linguistic relatedness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "measures similarity between original and simulated fingerprints using cosine-based pseudo-metrics"
  - [section] "Equation (2) provides answers close to the correct geometric formula (2), but it does not fail in the case of an empty fake image"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighbor papers focus on different similarity metrics (not cosine-based for text)
- Break condition: If cosine similarity is dominated by noise rather than meaningful linguistic features, or if the metric fails to discriminate between unrelated languages

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Logistic regression on trace and determinant invariants effectively classifies language relationships
- Mechanism: The 2×2 matrix of correlation values (C_1, C_2 for each language pair) has trace and determinant as invariants that capture the asymmetry in recognition capabilities. Logistic regression learns decision boundaries between relationship categories (A, B, C, D) based on these invariants
- Core assumption: The mathematical invariants of the correlation matrix contain sufficient information to distinguish linguistic relationships
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "An initial sample without Finnish and Minoan (15 pairs) was used to train the Mathematica© classifier algorithm with the logistic regression method"
  - [section] "Classification categories are given as 'A' – no relationship, 'B' – possible geographic or contemporaneous relationship, 'C' – pair is linguistically related, and 'D' – pair is linguistically related and contemporaneous"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - neighbor papers use different classification approaches
- Break condition: If the invariants don't capture discriminative features, or if logistic regression overfits the small training set

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial training dynamics in GANs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how generator and discriminator compete helps debug training instability and interpret why certain language pairs fail to classify
  - Quick check question: What happens to the generator's output distribution when the discriminator becomes too strong too quickly?

- Concept: Matrix norms and cosine similarity in high-dimensional spaces
  - Why needed here: The pseudo-metric relies on Frobenius norms and cosine similarity; understanding their geometric interpretation is crucial for parameter tuning
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity behave when one vector is much longer than the other in the context of fingerprint comparison?

- Concept: Logistic regression and decision boundaries
  - Why needed here: The post-processing uses logistic regression on derived features; knowing how it handles multi-class problems and regularization helps improve classification
  - Quick check question: How does logistic regression handle imbalanced classes when classifying rare linguistic relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing: Text → UTF-8 → 64×64 arrays (fingerprints)
  c-GAN: Generator (random noise → fake fingerprints), Discriminator (real vs fake classifier)
  Distance computation: Cosine pseudo-metric between original and fake fingerprints
  Post-processing: Matrix invariants (trace, determinant) → Logistic regression → Relationship categories

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess text samples into standardized 64×64 fingerprints
  2. Train c-GAN on language pairs (train-test split)
  3. Generate fake fingerprints and compute cosine similarities
  4. Calculate invariants and classify using trained logistic regression
  5. Evaluate classification accuracy on out-of-sample languages

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed 64×64 size vs. variable-length text: Simplicity and comparability vs. potential information loss
  - Cosine pseudo-metric vs. other distances: Robustness to empty fakes vs. possible loss of sensitivity
  - Small sample sizes vs. computational feasibility: Faster training vs. higher variance in results

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in fake fingerprint generation across runs
  - Low cosine similarities across all language pairs (no discriminative power)
  - Logistic regression predicting the same class for all inputs
  - Classification probabilities evenly distributed across categories

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test fingerprint generation: Run c-GAN on a single language pair and visualize original vs. fake fingerprints to verify the generator learns meaningful patterns
  2. Distance metric validation: Compute cosine similarities for related and unrelated language pairs and check if they form distinct distributions
  3. Classification sanity check: Train logistic regression on synthetic data with known invariants to ensure the post-processing pipeline works before using real language data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the affinity between Cypro-Minoan and English result from genuine linguistic similarity or transliteration artifacts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the English affinity may "possibly be attributed to the particular defects of transliteration."
- Why unresolved: The sample size is extremely small (2,070 characters), and transliteration choices could artificially create similarities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Larger Cypro-Minoan corpora, multiple transliteration systems, and comparison with other potential language families.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the c-GAN fingerprinting approach distinguish between one vs. multiple languages in the Cypro-Minoan corpus?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We do not touch on the problem of whether Cypro-Minoan inscriptions were written in one, or several languages."
- Why unresolved: The current sample is too limited to test this hypothesis, and the method has not been validated on known multilingual corpora.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on confirmed multilingual corpora (e.g., Linear B tablets with different languages) and applying the method to larger Cypro-Minoan datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between the visual fingerprint representation and actual linguistic features (phonology, syntax, semantics)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The method relies on visual fingerprint correlations without explaining how these relate to linguistic structure.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats the fingerprints as abstract patterns without connecting them to linguistic theory or demonstrating that visual similarity corresponds to linguistic relatedness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments showing that known linguistic changes (sound shifts, grammatical evolution) produce predictable changes in fingerprints, and validation against established language family classifications.

## Limitations
- Small sample sizes (6 training languages) may limit generalizability
- Fixed 64×64 fingerprint size could lose linguistic information from longer texts
- The transliteration process may introduce artifacts affecting Cypro-Minoan results
- No validation on fully deciphered ancient languages to establish baseline performance

## Confidence
- Core classification methodology: Medium
- Applications to undeciphered scripts: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test classification stability across multiple random seeds and training runs to assess variance
2. Apply the method to a known language family (e.g., Romance languages) to validate accuracy on deciphered scripts
3. Compare results using different fingerprint sizes (32×32, 128×128) to assess information loss at 64×64 resolution
