core_contribution: HUGSIM is a real-time, photo-realistic, closed-loop simulator for
  autonomous driving evaluation. It reconstructs dynamic urban scenes using 3D Gaussian
  Splatting with multi-modal rendering (appearance, semantics, flow, depth) and applies
  physical constraints (unicycle model, multi-plane ground) to improve fidelity.

## Executive Summary
HUGSIM introduces a novel closed-loop simulator for autonomous driving that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic urban scenes in real-time. The system provides photo-realistic rendering across multiple modalities including appearance, semantics, optical flow, and depth, enabling comprehensive evaluation of autonomous driving systems. The simulator supports multiple datasets (KITTI-360, Waymo, nuScenes, PandaSet) and introduces the HD-Score metric for holistic evaluation of driving performance across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions.

## Method Summary
The simulator reconstructs dynamic urban scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting with multi-modal rendering capabilities. It applies physical constraints including a unicycle model and multi-plane ground representation to improve fidelity. The system enables 360-degree rendering of both native and non-native vehicles, supports real-time performance requirements, and provides a benchmark with over 400 scenarios across four difficulty levels. The HD-Score metric combines multiple evaluation dimensions to provide a comprehensive assessment of driving performance.

## Key Results
- Superior performance in novel view synthesis and semantic reconstruction compared to existing methods
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on extrapolated views with real-time rendering capabilities
- Enables efficient actor behavior generation for safety-critical scenarios through the 400+ scenario benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The simulator's effectiveness stems from its 3D Gaussian Splatting approach, which provides high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes while maintaining real-time performance. The multi-modal rendering capability allows for comprehensive evaluation across different perception tasks. Physical constraints ensure realistic vehicle dynamics and scene geometry. The system's ability to handle both native and non-native vehicles in 360-degree rendering provides flexibility for testing diverse autonomous driving scenarios.

- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: 3D point-based representation that enables efficient rendering of complex scenes; needed for real-time performance while maintaining visual quality; quick check: verify Gaussian count and rendering FPS meet real-time requirements
- **Multi-modal Rendering**: Simultaneous rendering of appearance, semantics, optical flow, and depth; needed for comprehensive autonomous driving evaluation; quick check: validate each modality's accuracy against ground truth
- **Unicycle Model**: Kinematic model for vehicle motion; needed for realistic vehicle dynamics simulation; quick check: verify trajectory predictions match physical constraints

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Sensor Data -> Scene Reconstruction -> 3D Gaussian Splatting -> Multi-modal Rendering -> Behavior Generation -> HD-Score Evaluation
- **Critical Path**: Scene reconstruction and 3D Gaussian Splatting are the performance bottlenecks; multi-modal rendering follows; behavior generation and evaluation are less time-critical
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Real-time performance vs. rendering quality (Gaussian count), comprehensive evaluation vs. computational cost (multi-modal rendering), scenario diversity vs. dataset limitations
- **Failure Signatures**: Gaussian density limitations in complex scenes, rendering artifacts at extreme viewing angles, performance degradation with multiple concurrent agents, metric insensitivity to certain safety-critical failures
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Validate real-time performance (FPS) under varying scene complexity and Gaussian density
  2. Test multi-modal rendering accuracy against ground truth for each modality
  3. Evaluate HD-Score sensitivity to different driving behaviors and failure modes
