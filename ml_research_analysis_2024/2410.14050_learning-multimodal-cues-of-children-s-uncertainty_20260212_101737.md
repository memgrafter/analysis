# Learning Multimodal Cues of Children's Uncertainty

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14050
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14050
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: First annotated dataset for studying nonverbal cues of uncertainty in young children using multimodal approach

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first annotated dataset for studying nonverbal cues of uncertainty in young children, using a multimodal approach to detect uncertainty during a counting game task. The dataset captures uncertainty cues across video, audio, and text modalities, with annotations based on behavioral cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and verbal hesitations. The authors developed an ensemble learning model that predicts uncertainty by first identifying these cues using multimodal transformers, and then using a classifier to determine the uncertainty level. The ensemble model outperformed baseline models, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.8366 and MAE of 0.2222, showing that incorporating cues like eyebrow movements and hand-on-face gestures significantly improves prediction accuracy. The study also analyzed the relationship between task difficulty, performance, and uncertainty, highlighting age and gender differences in uncertainty expression.

## Method Summary
The study collects video, audio, and text data from children ages 4-5 performing an Approximate Number System task with 30 trials per child. Multimodal features are extracted using OpenFace for video (facial action units, gaze, pose), Degottex toolkit for audio (glottal source and spectral envelope features), and GloVe embeddings for text transcriptions. Three approaches are tested: a Multimodal Transformer model, contrastive learning with weighted sampling, and a cue-based ensemble learning approach that first predicts uncertainty cues then predicts uncertainty from those cues. The models are evaluated using weighted F1 score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) metrics.

## Key Results
- Ensemble model achieved weighted F1 score of 0.8366 and MAE of 0.2222
- Incorporating uncertainty cues like eyebrow movements and hand-on-face gestures significantly improves prediction accuracy
- Uncertainty strongly correlates with task difficulty (r = -0.927) but not with correctness (r = 0.290)
- Age and gender differences observed in uncertainty expression patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ensemble model outperforms end-to-end multimodal transformers by leveraging intermediate uncertainty cue prediction.
- Mechanism: The model first predicts explicit uncertainty cues (e.g., eyebrow raise, hand on face) using separate multimodal transformers for each cue, then uses these predictions as features for a final MLP classifier to determine overall uncertainty.
- Core assumption: Certain behavioral cues have strong and consistent associations with uncertainty expression that can be reliably detected from multimodal inputs.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions ensemble model outperforming baseline models with specific metrics; section confirms cue-aware ensemble improvements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task difficulty strongly correlates with uncertainty expression, enabling uncertainty prediction without relying on performance correctness.
- Mechanism: The experimental design uses an Approximate Number System task where difficulty is controlled by ratio manipulation. Since uncertainty correlates strongly with difficulty (r = -0.927) but not with correctness, the model can predict uncertainty based on task context and difficulty indicators rather than performance outcomes.
- Core assumption: Task difficulty is a reliable proxy for internal uncertainty states in children during cognitive tasks.
- Evidence anchors: Section reports high correlation between uncertainty and task difficulty, and no substantial correlation with correctness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal fusion captures complementary uncertainty signals that single modalities miss.
- Mechanism: The model combines visual features (facial action units, gaze, pose from OpenFace), audio features (glottal source and spectral envelope), and sparse text features (annotated transcriptions). This combination captures uncertainty signals that may be expressed through different channels - facial expressions, vocal hesitations, or verbal statements.
- Core assumption: Uncertainty is expressed multimodally with each modality providing unique, non-redundant information.
- Evidence anchors: Section cites multimodal models improving performance by grounding human condition aspects beyond text.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Approximate Number System (ANS) and Weber's Law
  - Why needed here: The experimental task relies on ANS to manipulate task difficulty by varying ratios between dot quantities.
  - Quick check question: Why does a 10:9 ratio (1.11) produce more uncertainty than a 10:5 ratio (2.0) according to Weber's Law?

- Concept: Multimodal Transformer Architecture
  - Why needed here: The model uses modified Transformer architecture with cross-modal attention to fuse visual, audio, and text features.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-modal attention in the Transformer architecture differ from self-attention, and why is it important for multimodal fusion?

- Concept: Ensemble Learning and Intermediate Feature Prediction
  - Why needed here: The proposed ensemble approach uses intermediate cue prediction as features for final uncertainty classification.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using intermediate predictions as features compared to end-to-end learning in multimodal classification tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw multimodal data → OpenFace (AUs, gaze, pose) → Degottex (glottal, spectral) → GloVe embeddings → Cue-specific transformers → Feature fusion → MLP classifier
- Critical path: Raw multimodal data → Feature extraction → Cue prediction → Feature fusion → Uncertainty classification
- Design tradeoffs: Ensemble vs. end-to-end (interpretability vs. complexity), cue selection (coverage vs. noise), class balancing (minority class attention vs. overfitting)
- Failure signatures: Poor cue prediction (check feature quality), good cues but poor classification (check fusion/classifier), unimodal better than multimodal (check for redundancy/noise), high variance (check preprocessing/initialization)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Ablation study with individual modalities, 2) Ensemble vs. end-to-end comparison, 3) Cue importance analysis with different cue subsets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does incorporating contextual features about participants' personalities and recent cognitive states affect uncertainty prediction accuracy? (Basis: Paper suggests contextual features could improve predictions)
- Would a task requiring more verbal responses from children improve the contribution of text and audio modalities in uncertainty prediction? (Basis: Paper expects more verbal tasks would increase text/audio contributions)
- How do the uncertainty expression conventions differ between children of different ages, and how can these differences be modeled effectively? (Basis: Paper finds age-dependent behavior patterns but doesn't develop age-specific models)

## Limitations

- Small dataset (N=10 children, 30 trials each) limiting generalizability across diverse populations
- Binary and coarse-grained annotations potentially missing nuanced uncertainty states
- Unknown model performance on out-of-distribution data (different tasks, age groups, or cultural contexts)

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Ensemble model outperforms baseline approaches on reported dataset; multimodal fusion captures complementary uncertainty signals
- **Medium Confidence**: Correlation between task difficulty and uncertainty expression generalizes to other cognitive tasks; identified uncertainty cues are reliable predictors across contexts
- **Low Confidence**: Model performance in real-world educational settings; ability to generalize to children with different developmental profiles; stability of uncertainty expressions across cultural contexts

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Cultural Validation: Test the model on children from diverse cultural backgrounds to assess cultural universality of identified uncertainty cues
2. Age Generalization Study: Evaluate model performance on children outside the 4-5 age range to determine developmental boundaries
3. Task Transferability Assessment: Apply the trained model to a different cognitive task to evaluate generalization beyond Approximate Number System task
