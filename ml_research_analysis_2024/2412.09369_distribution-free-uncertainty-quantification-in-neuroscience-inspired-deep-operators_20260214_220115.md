# Distribution free uncertainty quantification in neuroscience-inspired deep operators

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.09369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09369
- Authors: Shailesh Garg; Souvik Chakraborty
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a conformalized randomized prior operator (CRP-O) framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in spiking and non-spiking neural operators.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the CRP-O framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification in neural operators, combining Randomized Prior (RP) networks with Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) to provide guaranteed marginal coverage. The approach is specifically designed for spiking neural operators like Variable Spiking Wavelet Neural Operator (VSWNO) and is tested on four PDE datasets. A Gaussian Process extension enables zero-shot super-resolution UQ. The framework achieves the desired 95% coverage at all spatial locations while providing tighter uncertainty bounds compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The CRP-O framework integrates RP operators for initial uncertainty estimation with SCP calibration to provide guaranteed marginal coverage. RP networks use ensemble training with prior information to generate initial uncertainty bounds. SCP then calibrates these bounds using a quantile computed from a calibration dataset. For super-resolution applications, a GP interpolates conformal parameters from the training grid to higher resolution grids. The framework is implemented with VSWNO and WNO architectures and evaluated on 1D and 2D PDEs including Burgers, Darcy, and Helmholtz equations.

## Key Results
- CRP-O achieves the desired 95% marginal coverage across all spatial locations in tested PDE datasets
- The framework significantly outperforms vanilla RP, quantile-based, and conformalized quantile methods in terms of coverage and bound tightness
- Super-resolution capability demonstrates effective UQ at higher resolutions through GP interpolation of conformal parameters
- The method shows strong performance on both spiking (VSWNO) and non-spiking (WNO) neural operator variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
RP networks combine ensemble training with prior information in a deterministic framework, generating initial uncertainty bounds that are sufficiently accurate for effective split conformal calibration. This provides a robust starting point for uncertainty quantification.

### Mechanism 2
Split conformal prediction uses a calibration set to compute a quantile parameter that ensures the final confidence intervals achieve the desired coverage probability. This provides distribution-free marginal coverage guarantees.

### Mechanism 3
Gaussian Process regression enables zero-shot super-resolution uncertainty quantification by interpolating conformal parameters from training to higher resolution grids, assuming smooth spatial variation in the conformal parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Conformal prediction and marginal vs. conditional coverage**: Why needed here - The paper relies on split conformal prediction to provide marginal coverage guarantees. Quick check: What is the key difference between conditional coverage and marginal coverage in conformal prediction?

- **Randomized Prior networks and ensemble-based uncertainty**: Why needed here - RP operators serve as the initial uncertainty estimator before conformal calibration. Quick check: How do RP networks incorporate prior information while maintaining a deterministic framework?

- **Gaussian Process regression and kernel selection**: Why needed here - GP is used to extend uncertainty quantification to super-resolution predictions. Quick check: What role does the covariance kernel play in GP-based interpolation of conformal parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RP operator (ensemble of base operators with prior networks) → Mean and standard deviation computation → Initial uncertainty bounds → Split conformal calibration → Calibrated bounds; Optional: GP interpolation for super-resolution
- **Critical path**: Train RP operator → Compute initial uncertainty → Apply split conformal calibration → Generate final bounds
- **Design tradeoffs**: RP ensemble size vs. computational cost; calibration set size vs. coverage guarantee strength; GP kernel complexity vs. interpolation accuracy
- **Failure signatures**: RP operator fails to capture uncertainty (calibration requires excessive data); split conformal calibration fails (coverage < target); GP interpolation fails (super-resolution bounds inaccurate)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train RP-WNO on a simple 1D PDE dataset and verify initial uncertainty estimates
  2. Apply split conformal calibration with varying calibration set sizes to observe coverage improvement
  3. Test super-resolution capability by predicting at higher resolution and evaluating GP interpolation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How sensitive is the CRP-O framework's performance to the choice of prior network architecture in RP operators? The paper mentions that "the prior network can either be an instance of VSWNO or a simpler WNO model" but does not explore different prior architectures systematically.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal size of the calibration dataset for achieving the desired coverage in different problem domains? The paper demonstrates that the framework works with the calibration datasets used in examples but does not provide specific guidelines for determining optimal calibration dataset size.

### Open Question 3
Can the CRP-O framework achieve conditional coverage (CC) rather than just marginal coverage (MCC)? The paper acknowledges that "CC is more powerful than MCC, getting bounds that satisfy CC within neural network algorithms is non-trivial" and focuses on MCC without attempting to achieve CC.

## Limitations

- Performance depends critically on RP operator's ability to provide accurate initial uncertainty estimates, with no theoretical analysis of when RP operators will fail
- GP-based super-resolution assumes smooth spatial variation in conformal parameters, which may not hold for problems with sharp spatial discontinuities
- Framework's performance on higher-dimensional problems (3D+) remains untested, as all evaluated PDEs were 1D or 2D

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Split conformal prediction provides distribution-free marginal coverage guarantees when calibration assumptions are met
- **Medium Confidence**: RP operators provide sufficiently accurate initial uncertainty estimates for effective calibration
- **Medium Confidence**: GP interpolation effectively extends UQ to super-resolution settings
- **Low Confidence**: Framework generalizes to high-dimensional PDEs and problems with sharp spatial discontinuities

## Next Checks

1. **RP Operator Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the RP ensemble size and measure the resulting calibration set size required to achieve 95% coverage to quantify the practical impact of RP quality on the overall framework.

2. **Out-of-Distribution Testing**: Evaluate CRP-O performance when calibration data differs from test data (e.g., different boundary conditions or forcing terms) to assess robustness to distribution shifts.

3. **High-Dimensional Extension**: Test the framework on a 3D PDE problem to validate scalability and identify any dimensional limitations in the GP-based super-resolution approach.
