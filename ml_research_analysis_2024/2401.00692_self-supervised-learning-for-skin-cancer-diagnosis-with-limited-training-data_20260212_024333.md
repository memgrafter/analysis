# Self-supervised learning for skin cancer diagnosis with limited training data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.00692
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00692
- Authors: Hamish Haggerty; Rohitash Chandra
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Self-supervised pre-training on ImageNet and task-specific data improves skin cancer diagnosis with limited labelled data

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for skin cancer diagnosis when labelled training data is scarce. The authors compare supervised and self-supervised pre-training approaches using ResNet-50 models on skin lesion datasets. Their findings demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training via Barlow Twins on ImageNet outperforms standard supervised pre-training when fine-tuning on small datasets. Importantly, they show that further self-supervised pre-training on task-specific medical images can enhance both pre-trained models, with supervised pre-training eventually matching self-supervised performance.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate both supervised and self-supervised pre-training strategies for medical image classification. They use a ResNet-50 architecture and employ the Barlow Twins method for self-supervised pre-training on ImageNet. After pre-training, models are fine-tuned on a skin lesion dataset with limited labelled examples. Additionally, they apply further self-supervised pre-training on task-specific data before fine-tuning. Linear probe experiments are conducted to assess feature extraction quality and understand the source of performance improvements.

## Key Results
- Self-supervised pre-training via Barlow Twins on ImageNet outperforms standard supervised pre-training when fine-tuning on small skin lesion datasets
- Further self-supervised pre-training on task-specific medical images enhances both pre-trained models
- Supervised pre-training closes the performance gap with self-supervised pre-training after task-specific fine-tuning
- Linear probe experiments indicate that performance gains stem from improved feature extraction capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training in this context appears to be the enhanced feature extraction capabilities developed during pre-training. By learning meaningful representations from large-scale unlabeled data (ImageNet), the model develops a robust feature extractor that can be fine-tuned for the specific medical imaging task. The additional self-supervised pre-training on task-specific data allows the model to adapt these features to the particular characteristics of skin lesions, further improving performance.

## Foundational Learning
1. Self-supervised learning (SSL) in computer vision
   - Why needed: Enables model training without extensive labelled data
   - Quick check: Understanding contrastive learning and instance discrimination

2. Transfer learning and fine-tuning
   - Why needed: Allows leveraging pre-trained models for specific tasks
   - Quick check: Knowledge of how feature extractors are adapted to new tasks

3. Medical image classification challenges
   - Why needed: Understanding domain-specific difficulties in skin cancer diagnosis
   - Quick check: Familiarity with limited labelled data and class imbalance issues

4. Barlow Twins method
   - Why needed: Specific SSL technique used for pre-training
   - Quick check: Understanding of redundancy reduction and cross-correlation matrix

5. Linear probe evaluation
   - Why needed: Method to assess feature quality independently of classifier
   - Quick check: Knowledge of frozen feature extractor and linear classifier training

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ImageNet dataset -> Barlow Twins SSL pre-training -> Skin lesion dataset -> Fine-tuning -> Classification

Critical path: Pre-training (SSL or supervised) -> Task-specific pre-training -> Fine-tuning -> Evaluation

Design tradeoffs: The paper explores the tradeoff between large-scale pre-training on general data versus task-specific pre-training, finding that both approaches can be effective when data is limited.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may result from inadequate pre-training, insufficient task-specific fine-tuning, or mismatch between pre-training data distribution and target task.

First experiments:
1. Replicate the comparison between supervised and self-supervised pre-training on ImageNet
2. Conduct further self-supervised pre-training on task-specific data for both pre-trained models
3. Perform linear probe experiments to validate feature extraction improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single architecture (ResNet-50) and one SSL method (Barlow Twins)
- Skin lesion dataset characteristics (size, diversity, clinical relevance) not explicitly detailed
- Linear probe experiments provide evidence but don't fully elucidate underlying mechanisms
- Results may not generalize to other medical imaging tasks or domains

## Confidence
- Self-supervised pre-training on ImageNet and task-specific data improves performance with limited labels: High
- Minimal task-specific pre-training can match large-scale ImageNet pre-training: Medium
- Comparison between supervised and self-supervised pre-training benefits: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed approach across multiple SSL methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) and model architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers) to assess generalizability.
2. Test the framework on multiple medical imaging datasets with varying lesion types, sizes, and clinical contexts to establish robustness.
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal amount of task-specific pre-training data needed to achieve performance comparable to ImageNet pre-training.
