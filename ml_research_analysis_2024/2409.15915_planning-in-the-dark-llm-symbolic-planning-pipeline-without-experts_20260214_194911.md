# Planning in the Dark: LLM-Symbolic Planning Pipeline without Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15915
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15915
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents an expert-free LLM-symbolic planning pipeline that constructs diverse action schema libraries and uses semantic validation to filter and rank candidates without human intervention.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a fully automated LLM-symbolic planning pipeline that eliminates the traditional bottleneck of expert refinement. The approach generates multiple action schema libraries from natural language problem descriptions and uses semantic validation to filter and rank candidates without human intervention. Experiments demonstrate the method can produce diverse, solvable schema sets and generate competitive plans compared to direct LLM planning approaches, even for short-horizon tasks. Human evaluation found the generated plans comparable to gold-standard plans, validating the feasibility of expert-free end-to-end planning systems.

## Method Summary
The proposed pipeline operates by first prompting a large language model to generate diverse action schema libraries from problem descriptions. These candidate schemas undergo semantic validation using similarity measures to filter and rank the most appropriate ones. The validated schemas are then used with traditional symbolic planners to generate plans. The key innovation is the semantic validation step that automatically filters out poor schema candidates without requiring expert input, enabling fully automated end-to-end planning from natural language descriptions.

## Key Results
- Generated multiple diverse and solvable action schema libraries without expert intervention
- Produced competitive plans compared to direct LLM planning approaches on short-horizon tasks
- Human evaluation found generated plans comparable to gold-standard plans in quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline leverages the LLM's ability to generate diverse schema representations combined with semantic validation to automatically filter and rank candidates. This addresses the traditional bottleneck where expert refinement is required to select appropriate schemas. By using semantic similarity measures, the system can identify and eliminate inconsistent or poor-quality schemas while preserving the diversity needed for robust planning. The approach effectively combines the flexibility of LLM-generated content with the reliability of automated filtering, enabling expert-free planning.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Action Schema Generation** - LLMs can generate formal action representations from natural language descriptions. Why needed: Traditional planning requires manually crafted schemas. Quick check: Verify generated schemas follow PDDL syntax and capture essential preconditions/effects.

2. **Semantic Validation** - Using similarity measures to filter schema candidates. Why needed: LLM-generated content is noisy and requires quality control. Quick check: Measure precision/recall of filtering against ground truth schemas.

3. **Symbolic Planning Integration** - Combining LLM-generated schemas with classical planners. Why needed: LLMs alone often produce suboptimal plans. Quick check: Compare plan quality metrics between LLM-only and hybrid approaches.

4. **Diversity Preservation** - Maintaining multiple schema variants for robustness. Why needed: Single schema representations may miss important solution paths. Quick check: Measure schema diversity using pairwise similarity metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Problem Description -> LLM Schema Generation -> Semantic Validation -> Schema Ranking -> Symbolic Planning -> Plan Output

Critical Path: The semantic validation step is the bottleneck, as it must process and evaluate all generated schema candidates before planning can proceed.

Design Tradeoffs: The system trades potential schema accuracy (compared to expert-crafted schemas) for scalability and accessibility. Multiple schema sets provide redundancy but increase computational overhead.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include LLM generating inconsistent schemas, semantic validation incorrectly filtering good schemas, or symbolic planner failing due to incompatible schema representations.

First 3 Experiments:
1. Generate schemas for simple planning problems and manually verify syntax correctness
2. Test semantic validation on known good/bad schema pairs to measure filtering accuracy
3. Run full pipeline on benchmark planning domains and compare plan quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation comparison lacks specific quantitative metrics for quality assessment
- Method's performance on long-horizon tasks remains untested (experiments focus on short-horizon scenarios)
- No empirical validation of schema diversity claims or comparison to expert-curated schemas

## Confidence

- High confidence: The pipeline can generate action schemas without expert intervention
- Medium confidence: Competitive performance compared to direct LLM planning for short-horizon tasks
- Low confidence: Claim about plan quality being "comparable to gold-standard plans" due to lack of quantitative metrics

## Next Checks

1. Conduct diversity analysis of generated action schemas by measuring pairwise semantic similarity and comparing against expert-curated schemas across multiple domains

2. Test the pipeline on long-horizon planning tasks (minimum 10 steps) to evaluate scalability and identify failure patterns

3. Implement quantitative metrics for plan quality evaluation (e.g., plan length efficiency, goal completion rate) with statistical significance testing against human-curated baselines
