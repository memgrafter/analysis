# Exploring and Learning Structure: Active Inference Approach in Navigational Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.05982
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05982
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel computational model integrates Active Inference with topological mapping to enable one-shot learning of ambiguous environments without prior knowledge of map size or observation types.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel computational model for navigation and mapping inspired by animal navigation strategies, integrating traditional cognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF). The model dynamically learns environmental structure and expands its internal map using topological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and structure learning. It can rapidly learn environmental structures in a single episode with minimal navigation overlap, without prior knowledge of the environment's dimensions or observation types. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in navigating ambiguous environments.

## Method Summary
The method combines hierarchical spatial abstraction with Active Inference, implementing dynamic parameter learning where the model grows its state space by predicting one-step outcomes in all directions and adding new states when expected positions are unvisited. The agent selects actions based on expected free energy, with no prior preferences set so the information gain term dominates. Policy selection minimizes expected free energy while state inference integrates observations and proprioception to maintain belief over states and positions. The model expands its transition matrices dynamically as new states are discovered through exploration.

## Key Results
- The model achieves one-shot learning of novel environments without prior knowledge of map size or observation types
- Successfully navigates ambiguous environments by integrating proprioceptive positioning with visual observations
- Demonstrates superior performance compared to CSCG in environments with aliased observations
- Can rapidly learn environmental structures in a single episode with minimal navigation overlap

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Dynamic model expansion enables one-shot learning by growing state space through predicting one-step outcomes in all directions and adding new states when expected positions are unvisited. This is analogous to Bayesian model reduction but extended to predictive beliefs rather than observed data. Core assumption: agent can accurately predict unobserved states from known transitions and local motion.

### Mechanism 2
Information-gain-driven exploration accelerates discovery of ambiguous environments by prioritizing uncertain states. The agent selects actions based on expected free energy with no prior preferences set, so the utility term is neutral and information gain term dominates. This drives the agent toward states with high epistemic uncertainty.

### Mechanism 3
Integration of proprioceptive positioning with visual observations resolves aliasing without explicit state cloning. By inferring both the state (room identity) and the pose (relative position within the map) from observation + motion history, the model avoids the need for multiple clones of the same observation in the belief network.

## Foundational Learning

- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**: The navigation task is partially observable because the agent only sees the current room, not its global position; POMDP formalizes state inference under uncertainty. Quick check: In a POMDP, what two components must be inferred from observations and actions to maintain belief over hidden states?

- **Variational Inference**: Exact posterior over states is intractable in large environments; variational inference approximates the posterior using a tractable family of distributions. Quick check: What is the name of the optimization objective that balances posterior approximation accuracy and model complexity in variational inference?

- **Expected Free Energy**: Guides policy selection by balancing expected accuracy (matching observations) and expected information gain (reducing uncertainty). Quick check: In active inference, which term of expected free energy drives exploration when no preferences are set?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Observation preprocessor → hierarchical abstraction (room color) → State inference module (POMDP with variational inference) → Position inference module (updates pose when crossing doors) → Model expansion engine (grows B matrices on predicted transitions) → Policy selection module (minimizes expected free energy) → Transition learning module (updates Bs, Ao, Ap with new data)

- **Critical path**: Observe → infer state+pose → predict next states → expand model if needed → select policy → act → repeat

- **Design tradeoffs**: Model expansion vs. computational cost (expanding state space every step increases matrix sizes); Information gain vs. goal-directed behavior (pure epistemic drive may be inefficient if a goal is known); Belief consolidation vs. false positives (low learning rates on imagined transitions avoid cementing wrong beliefs but slow learning)

- **Failure signatures**: Model stops expanding (possible proprioceptive failure or motion aliasing); Agent cycles in same room (information gain signal flat or transition probabilities stuck at zero); High uncertainty in known transitions (learning rate too low or data too sparse)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Single-room environment with no aliasing → verify state inference and model stability; 2) Linear corridor with aliased observations → test disambiguation via proprioception; 3) 2x2 grid with random start → measure exploration steps vs. oracle baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does increasing the prediction range of new states impact the efficiency and accuracy of navigation and map formation? Unresolved because the current model has a limited prediction range, and extending this range could enhance navigation but might also consolidate misbeliefs about transitions. Evidence needed: Experimental results comparing models with different prediction ranges in terms of navigation accuracy, map formation speed, and error rates.

### Open Question 2
What is the effect of a perfect memory on future policies and exploration efficiency? Unresolved because the current model does not have a perfect memory, and it is unclear how this would affect the agent's ability to learn and navigate. Evidence needed: Comparative experiments between models with varying memory capacities, measuring exploration efficiency, learning speed, and policy effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
How does the agent perform when trying to reach a defined objective in a familiar or novel environment? Unresolved because the current model focuses on exploration without specific objectives, and its performance in goal-directed tasks is not evaluated. Evidence needed: Experimental results showing the agent's success rate, efficiency, and adaptability in reaching predefined goals in both familiar and novel environments.

## Limitations

- No ablation studies isolating each mechanism's contribution to overall performance
- Limited evaluation environments beyond 2x2 and 3x3 grids, raising scalability concerns
- No quantitative comparison of exploration efficiency against established baselines beyond CSCG

## Confidence

- One-shot topological learning: High confidence (supported by dynamic model expansion mechanism, though lacks direct corpus evidence)
- Information-gain exploration strategy: Medium confidence (well-grounded in active inference theory but needs more rigorous statistical validation)
- Proprioception integration: Low-Medium confidence (relies heavily on comparison with CSCG rather than direct experimental isolation)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Test the model with proprioception disabled to quantify its contribution to disambiguation in aliased environments.

2. **Scalability Test**: Evaluate performance in larger grid environments (5x5 or 10x10) to assess computational tractability and learning efficiency at scale.

3. **Robustness Analysis**: Introduce controlled proprioceptive noise and measure the degradation in disambiguation accuracy and exploration efficiency.
