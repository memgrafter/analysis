# Evaluating AI fairness in credit scoring with the BRIO tool

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.03292
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03292
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: BRIO tool detects and evaluates bias in AI credit scoring models, finding the model generally fair with no significant bias beyond data limitations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a quantitative method for analyzing fairness issues in AI systems, focusing on credit scoring applications. The BRIO tool is employed to detect and evaluate bias in AI models, with a particular emphasis on the UCI German Credit Dataset. The study identifies sensitive attributes such as gender, age, and nationality, and assesses the model's performance across different demographic segments. The BRIO tool's risk assessment module aggregates fairness violation risks, providing a comprehensive measure of overall fairness risk. The analysis reveals that the credit scoring model is generally fair, with no significant bias beyond what is present in the data.

## Method Summary
The study uses the UCI German Credit Dataset (1000 instances, 20 features) to evaluate a credit scoring model's fairness. The Optibinning library generates binned variables and credit scores, achieving AUC ~0.8 and Gini ~0.6. The BRIO tool then analyzes the model using Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences to detect fairness violations across sensitive attributes (gender, age groups, nationality). The tool aggregates individual test risks into an overall fairness risk score, which is then analyzed alongside revenue implications across different score thresholds.

## Key Results
- BRIO successfully detects potential fairness violations using divergence measures between predicted and reference distributions
- The credit scoring model shows no significant bias amplification beyond existing data biases
- Fairness risk and profit exhibit non-monotonic behavior with score thresholds, suggesting optimal balance points around threshold 620

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BRIO uses divergence measures (Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon) to detect fairness violations between predicted and reference distributions.
- Mechanism: The tool computes the divergence between the model's output distribution for a sensitive class and either an ideal reference distribution or the distribution for another sensitive class, flagging violations when divergence exceeds a threshold.
- Core assumption: The divergence between probability distributions effectively captures fairness violations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "When we wish to compare how the system behaves with respect to an a priori optimal behaviour P , we use the Kullback–Leibler divergence DKL"
  - [section] "When we wish to compare classes, instead, a certain symmetry is required. Hence, we employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations to these specific divergence measures in credit scoring fairness work.
- Break condition: If the underlying probability distributions are poorly estimated or the reference distribution is inappropriate, divergence-based detection may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BRIO aggregates multiple bias detection results into a single risk measure using a weighted sum of individual test risks.
- Mechanism: Each test produces a hazard value based on likelihood of violation, number of affected individuals, distance from threshold, and weight of violation. These are aggregated across tests to produce an overall risk score in [0,1].
- Core assumption: Aggregating individual test risks through weighted summation provides a meaningful overall fairness risk measure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The BRIO system features a module devoted to the measurement of risk associated with fairness violations by AI systems"
  - [section] "Formally, the risk associated to an event is considered to be proportional both to the likelihood of its occurrence, and to the damage that it might cause"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations to this specific aggregation methodology.
- Break condition: If individual test risks are not properly calibrated or weights are inappropriate, aggregation may produce misleading overall risk scores.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adjusting the credit score threshold can balance fairness risk and profit in credit scoring.
- Mechanism: The analysis shows that both fairness risk and profit vary non-monotonically with threshold, suggesting optimal thresholds exist that minimize fairness risk while maintaining acceptable profit levels.
- Core assumption: Threshold selection is a viable intervention for managing fairness risk without severely compromising profitability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Both fairness risk and profit are to some extent dependent on the score threshold set for distinguishing between good and bad scores"
  - [section] "Notably, both fairness and profit exhibit non-monotonic behaviour"
  - [section] "setting the threshold around 620 can, in this particular case, strike a very good balance between risk of fairness violations and profit"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work exists on fairness-accuracy tradeoffs in credit scoring, but specific threshold optimization for fairness-profit balance is less common.
- Break condition: If the relationship between threshold and fairness/profit is different in other contexts or datasets, threshold adjustment may not provide effective risk management.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Divergence measures (Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon)
  - Why needed here: These are the mathematical foundations for comparing probability distributions in fairness detection.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergence in terms of symmetry and value range?

- Concept: Probability distributions and statistical hypothesis testing
  - Why needed here: BRIO's fairness detection relies on comparing observed distributions against references or between classes.
  - Quick check question: Why does BRIO use threshold-based decision rules rather than p-values for fairness violation detection?

- Concept: Risk aggregation and multi-criteria decision making
  - Why needed here: The BRIO risk assessment module combines multiple test results into a single risk score.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a weighted sum versus other aggregation methods for combining fairness risks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing -> Bias detection (divergence calculations) -> Risk aggregation (hazard value computation) -> Output risk score
- Critical path: Data → Feature selection → Bias detection (divergence calculations) → Risk aggregation (hazard value computation) → Output risk score
- Design tradeoffs: Model-agnostic design provides flexibility but limits ability to incorporate model-specific fairness interventions. The threshold-based approach is interpretable but requires careful threshold calibration.
- Failure signatures: High risk scores with no clear pattern in individual test results may indicate threshold miscalibration. Inconsistent hazard values across sensitive attributes may indicate data quality issues or structural biases in the underlying dataset.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run BRIO on the German Credit Dataset with default parameters to establish baseline risk scores.
  2. Vary the threshold sensitivity setting (high vs low) to observe impact on risk scores and identify threshold calibration needs.
  3. Test BRIO's response to artificially introduced bias by modifying the dataset to create known unfair patterns, verifying that the tool detects these violations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the threshold selection for classifying "Good" and "Bad" credit scores impact fairness metrics and revenue generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the choice of a score threshold of 550 to distinguish between "Good" and "Bad" credit scores and mentions that this choice is subject to discussion.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the effects of different threshold values on fairness and revenue, leaving the optimal threshold as an open question.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical analysis comparing fairness metrics and revenue outcomes for various threshold values.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the effects of different fairness metrics on the identification and mitigation of bias in credit scoring models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions various fairness metrics such as disparate impact analysis, demographic parity, and equal opportunity criteria but does not explore their relative effectiveness in the context of the German Credit Dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper applies BRIO's fairness metrics but does not compare their performance against other established fairness metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study of different fairness metrics applied to the same dataset and their impact on bias detection and mitigation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the BRIO tool's risk assessment module perform in detecting and quantifying fairness violations across different datasets and contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents the BRIO tool's risk assessment module as a novel approach for aggregating fairness violation risks but does not validate its performance across diverse datasets or scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The tool is validated on the German Credit Dataset, but its generalizability and robustness are not tested on other datasets or in different domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing of the BRIO tool on multiple datasets from various domains to assess its accuracy, reliability, and applicability.

## Limitations

- Limited validation on diverse datasets beyond the German Credit Dataset, raising questions about generalizability
- Unclear specification of BRIO's aggregation parameters, particularly weight assignments for group vs individual fairness considerations
- Potential sensitivity to binning choices that could affect fairness detection accuracy

## Confidence

- High confidence: Divergence-based detection and threshold aggregation for fairness assessment are well-established approaches in statistical fairness literature
- Medium confidence: Implementation details of BRIO's risk aggregation function and optimal threshold selection for balancing fairness and profit
- Low confidence: Generalizability of results beyond the German Credit Dataset due to small sample size and specific demographic composition

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce BRIO analysis on multiple credit scoring datasets (e.g., Home Credit Default Risk) to assess generalizability of fairness detection and threshold optimization findings
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying BRIO's threshold parameters and aggregation weights to identify conditions under which risk scores remain stable or diverge significantly
3. Test BRIO's performance on synthetically biased datasets with known fairness violations to validate detection accuracy and false positive/negative rates
