# Order-Based Pre-training Strategies for Procedural Text Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04676
- Authors: Abhilash Nandy; Yash Kulkarni; Pawan Goyal; Niloy Ganguly

- Proposes three order-based pre-training methods for procedural text understanding

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces three novel pre-training strategies that leverage the inherent sequential nature of procedural text to improve downstream task performance. The authors propose Permutation Classification, Embedding Regression, and Skip-Clip methods that use step order as a supervision signal during pre-training. These methods are evaluated on Entity-Tracking tasks using NPN-Cooking and ProPara datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches and state-of-the-art large language models.

## Method Summary
The paper presents three distinct pre-training approaches that capitalize on the ordered nature of procedural text. Permutation Classification trains models to distinguish between correct and permuted sequences of procedural steps. Embedding Regression learns to predict the positional embedding of each step within the sequence. Skip-Clip focuses on predicting the order of non-consecutive steps. These methods are designed to capture the temporal and causal relationships inherent in procedural instructions without requiring additional labeled data.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baseline methods on both NPN-Cooking and ProPara datasets
- Achieves 1.6% improvement on NPN-Cooking dataset across evaluation metrics
- Demonstrates 7-9% improvement on ProPara dataset compared to baselines
- Shows better performance than state-of-the-art large language models on procedural understanding tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of these methods stems from the fundamental nature of procedural text, where step order carries crucial semantic information about causality and temporal relationships. By using step order as supervision during pre-training, the models learn to internalize these temporal dependencies, which directly benefits downstream tasks that require understanding of entity states and their changes throughout the procedure. The sequential nature of procedures provides a rich, naturally occurring source of supervision that traditional pre-training objectives might miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Procedural Text Understanding**: Comprehension of text describing sequences of steps or actions - needed to recognize the unique characteristics of procedural instructions and why standard pre-training may be insufficient for this domain
- **Order Supervision**: Using sequence position or permutation as training signal - required to understand how temporal relationships can be leveraged as implicit labels during pre-training
- **Entity Tracking**: Monitoring entity states and changes across procedural steps - essential for grasping the downstream task requirements and why order-aware pre-training is beneficial
- **Permutation Classification**: Distinguishing between original and shuffled sequences - provides a method for training models to recognize valid procedural flows
- **Positional Embeddings**: Vector representations encoding position in sequence - necessary for understanding how step order information can be incorporated into model representations
- **Skip-Clip Prediction**: Predicting relationships between non-consecutive steps - offers insight into how models can learn broader temporal dependencies beyond immediate adjacency

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Pre-training Data -> Order-Based Pre-training Method -> Pre-trained Model -> Fine-tuning on Downstream Task -> Performance Evaluation
- **Critical Path**: Pre-training data preparation with step-order information → Application of one of three order-based methods → Model pre-training → Fine-tuning on entity tracking tasks → Evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The paper balances between leveraging existing procedural text corpora (cost-effective) versus creating specialized datasets, and between using simple order signals versus more complex temporal relationship modeling
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on permutation tasks would indicate models failing to capture order dependencies; failure to generalize to downstream tasks suggests overfit to specific procedural domains
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test each pre-training method independently on a simple procedural dataset 2) Compare permutation classification performance against random baseline 3) Evaluate embedding regression accuracy on held-out step positions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only two procedural text datasets (NPN-Cooking and ProPara), raising concerns about generalizability
- No comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each pre-training method
- Potential selection bias in paper selection methodology using FMR-based approach

## Confidence
- Claims about performance improvements: Medium (limited sample size, no detailed methodology)
- Claims about superiority over SoTA LLMs: Medium (no accounting for model scale differences)
- Claims about effectiveness of order-based supervision: Medium (needs validation across diverse domains)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate pre-trained models on at least three additional procedural text datasets from different domains (manufacturing, medical, educational) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies where each pre-training method is tested independently to quantify individual contributions to downstream performance
3. Perform cross-dataset transfer learning experiments where models pre-trained on one dataset are fine-tuned on another to test robustness of order-based supervision signal
