# COMMENTATOR: A Code-mixed Multilingual Text Annotation Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.03125
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03125
- Reference count: 18
- COMMENTATOR achieves 5x faster annotation speeds compared to state-of-the-art tools

## Executive Summary
COMMENTATOR is a web-based code-mixed multilingual text annotation framework designed to address the scarcity of high-quality datasets for NLP research in multilingual and code-mixed contexts. The tool supports token-level language identification, POS tagging, and sentence-level matrix language identification for Hinglish text, with plans to expand to additional tasks like NER and machine translation. Through human-based evaluations, COMMENTATOR demonstrates 5x faster annotation speeds compared to existing tools like YEDDA, MarkUp, INCEpTION, UBIAI, and GATE, particularly for LID and POS tasks. The framework offers features such as task-specific recommendations, parallel annotations, annotator feedback integration, and post-annotation analysis using metrics like Cohen's Kappa and Code-Mixing Index (CMI).

## Method Summary
COMMENTATOR is implemented as a web-based tool with separate annotator and admin panels built using ReactJS for the client module and Flask for the server module. The system connects to MongoDB for data management and integrates language identification and POS tagging libraries for task-specific recommendations. The framework supports token-level and sentence-level annotation tasks for Hinglish text, with plans to extend capabilities to additional annotation tasks. Human-based evaluations were conducted by recruiting annotators proficient in English and Hindi to compare annotation speeds and capabilities against state-of-the-art tools. The tool is publicly available and designed for simplicity, requiring minimal dependencies while offering a robust admin interface for data management and quality control.

## Key Results
- Achieves 5x faster annotation speeds compared to state-of-the-art tools like YEDDA, MarkUp, INCEpTION, UBIAI, and GATE
- Supports token-level language identification, POS tagging, and sentence-level matrix language identification for Hinglish text
- Provides features including task-specific recommendations, parallel annotations, annotator feedback integration, and post-annotation analysis using Cohen's Kappa and CMI metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
COMMENTATOR leverages a modern web-based architecture with ReactJS and Flask to provide an intuitive annotation interface that reduces cognitive load on annotators. The tool's task-specific recommendations, powered by integrated language identification and POS tagging libraries, guide annotators through the annotation process more efficiently. Parallel annotation capabilities allow multiple annotators to work simultaneously on the same dataset, while the feedback integration system enables continuous improvement of annotation quality. The post-annotation analysis using Cohen's Kappa and CMI metrics ensures high-quality annotated datasets that can be reliably used for training NLP models in code-mixed contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Code-mixing vs code-switching**: Understanding the distinction is crucial as code-mixing involves blending elements from different languages within a single utterance, while code-switching refers to alternating between languages. This distinction is needed to design appropriate annotation schemes and evaluation metrics.
- **Cohen's Kappa**: A statistical measure of inter-annotator agreement that accounts for chance agreement. This metric is essential for assessing annotation quality and reliability in multi-annotator settings.
- **Code-Mixing Index (CMI)**: A metric that quantifies the degree of code-mixing in a text by calculating the ratio of mixed tokens to total tokens. This is needed to characterize the complexity of code-mixed datasets.
- **Token-level vs sentence-level annotation**: Understanding the difference between annotating individual tokens versus entire sentences is crucial for designing appropriate annotation interfaces and evaluating annotation efficiency.
- **Matrix language identification**: The process of identifying the dominant language in a code-mixed sentence, which is essential for many downstream NLP tasks and requires specialized annotation approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: ReactJS Client -> Flask Server -> MongoDB Atlas -> Language Identification & POS Libraries

Critical Path: Annotator uploads text → System displays interface with recommendations → Annotator performs annotations → Data stored in MongoDB → Admin reviews using Cohen's Kappa and CMI metrics

Design Tradeoffs: COMMENTATOR prioritizes speed and simplicity over comprehensive feature set, focusing on core annotation tasks rather than advanced NLP functionalities. The decision to use web-based architecture enables accessibility but requires careful consideration of API latency and dependency management.

Failure Signatures: Slow annotation speeds may indicate API latency issues or inadequate task recommendations. Data management problems could arise from MongoDB configuration issues. Poor inter-annotator agreement might suggest unclear annotation guidelines or insufficient training.

First Experiments:
1. Test basic annotation functionality by uploading a small Hinglish dataset and verifying token-level language identification accuracy
2. Evaluate parallel annotation capabilities by having multiple annotators work on the same dataset simultaneously
3. Assess admin panel functionality by analyzing annotated data using Cohen's Kappa and CMI metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Current limitation to Hinglish text restricts generalizability to other code-mixed language pairs
- Claims about 5x speed improvement lack detailed experimental methodology and statistical significance testing
- Future expansion plans for NER, spell correction, normalization, and machine translation remain speculative without concrete implementation details

## Confidence

High confidence: Basic functionality as a web-based annotation tool is well-established through public repository and documented features. The ReactJS, Flask, and MongoDB architecture is standard and verifiable.

Medium confidence: The reported 5x speed improvement is plausible given design features like task-specific recommendations and parallel annotations, but lacks detailed experimental methodology for high confidence.

Low confidence: Claims about future expansion capabilities and performance with languages beyond Hinglish remain unverified and speculative.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the speed comparison experiment by recruiting 5-10 annotators proficient in Hinglish to perform identical annotation tasks using COMMENTATOR and at least two baseline tools, measuring actual time-to-completion with statistical significance testing.

2. Verify the Cohen's Kappa and Code-Mixing Index implementations by testing with publicly available code-mixed datasets and comparing results against established implementations.

3. Test the tool's scalability by uploading datasets of varying sizes (100, 1000, and 10000 sentences) to assess whether claimed operational ease and low latency hold under different loads.
