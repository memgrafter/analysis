# The Tile: A 2D Map of Ranking Scores for Two-Class Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04309
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04309
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a 2D visualization tool (Tile) that consolidates an infinite family of ranking scores for two-class classification tasks into a single parameterized map.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Tile, a novel 2D visualization framework that organizes an infinite family of ranking scores for two-class classification tasks. The Tile is parameterized by two application-specific preferences that map common evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, TPR, and PPV to specific locations on the 2D plane. The authors establish correspondences between the Tile and standard evaluation spaces (ROC and PR), demonstrating that iso-performance lines in ROC space correspond to curves on the Tile. Through rank correlation analysis, the Tile enables characterization of arbitrary scores and visualization of classifier ranking properties. The framework provides a comprehensive visual tool for comparing and selecting ranking scores based on application-specific requirements.

## Method Summary
The Tile visualizes ranking scores by parameterizing them with two application-specific importance weights (a, b) ∈ [0,1]². Each point on the Tile corresponds to a unique ranking score RI_a,b defined as a linear combination of the four confusion matrix outcomes. The authors analyze the relationship between the Tile and ROC space by studying iso-performance lines, showing they form pencils with vertices outside ROC space. They demonstrate rank correlation characterization by computing Kendall's τ between arbitrary scores and canonical Tile scores across sampled performance distributions. The framework is validated through toy examples and applied to a real-world COVID-19 CT scan classification problem.

## Key Results
- The Tile successfully consolidates accuracy, F1, TPR, PPV, and all Fβ scores at their theoretically expected locations
- Iso-performance lines in ROC space correspond to specific curves on the Tile, with pencils of parallel lines for each score
- Rank correlation heatmaps reveal how arbitrary scores relate to canonical Tile scores across performance distributions
- The Volume Under Tile (VUT) score shows high correlation with accuracy (Spearman's ρ ≈ 0.996) for uniform performance distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Tile consolidates an infinite family of ranking scores into a single 2D visualization by parameterizing them with two application-specific preferences.
- Mechanism: Each point (a, b) on the Tile corresponds to a unique ranking score RI_a,b defined by importance weights for each outcome (tn, fp, fn, tp). This maps the continuous parameter space to a single visualization where common scores like accuracy, F1, TPR, and PPV appear at fixed locations.
- Core assumption: The importance values can be normalized so that only two independent parameters (a, b) are needed to fully specify the relative importance of outcomes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Tile is parameterized by two parameters reflecting application-specific preferences"
  - [section] "Canonical ranking scores are given by RI_a,b = (1 − a)P_TN + aP_TP / (1 − a)P_TN + (1 − b)P_FP + bP_FN + aP_TP"
- Break condition: If the importance weights cannot be reduced to two independent parameters, the Tile loses its 2D mapping property.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iso-performance lines in ROC space correspond to curves on the Tile, enabling unified interpretation of classifier rankings.
- Mechanism: For each score on the Tile, there exists a pencil of parallel iso-performance lines in ROC space. The intersection point (vertex) of these lines is outside ROC space and moves along specific curves as parameters a and b vary. This allows mapping ROC performances to Tile scores and vice versa.
- Core assumption: The ROC space can be parameterized by FPR and TPR for fixed priors, and iso-performance lines for any ranking score form a pencil structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The first pencil...can be used to read the value of RI_a,b in any point of ROC"
  - [section] "For any I, the red point is in one of the gray areas"
- Break condition: If the ROC space cannot be parameterized by FPR and TPR independently, or if iso-performance lines do not form pencils, the correspondence breaks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Tile enables easy comparison and characterization of arbitrary scores by computing their rank correlation with all canonical scores.
- Mechanism: By sampling performances and computing Kendall's τ between an arbitrary score and each canonical score at each point on the Tile, one can visualize where the score behaves similarly to existing scores. This reveals the score's implicit preferences.
- Core assumption: Rank correlation between scores is meaningful for characterizing their behavior across performance distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The Tile can be used to characterize any score, showing the rank correlations between that score and all canonical ranking scores"
  - [section] "Fig. 4 shows the results obtained with the 9 probabilistic scores...for a uniform distribution of performances"
- Break condition: If rank correlation does not capture the essential behavior of scores, or if the performance distribution is highly non-uniform, characterization becomes unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Two-class classification confusion matrix structure
  - Why needed here: All ranking scores are defined based on the four outcomes (tn, fp, fn, tp), so understanding their relationships is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: What is the sum of P(tn), P(fp), P(fn), and P(tp) for any valid performance?

- Concept: ROC space parameterization
  - Why needed here: The Tile's relationship to ROC space is central to its interpretation, requiring understanding of FPR and TPR as coordinates.
  - Quick check question: How are FPR and TPR calculated from the confusion matrix probabilities?

- Concept: Performance orderings and ranking axioms
  - Why needed here: The Tile organizes scores by the orderings they induce, which must satisfy specific axioms for meaningful ranking.
  - Quick check question: What does Axiom 2 state about the relationship between classifier performance and ranking?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The Tile visualization consists of a 2D grid parameterized by (a, b) ∈ [0,1]², with each point representing a ranking score RI_a,b. The visualization overlays specific scores (accuracy, F1, etc.) at their canonical locations, and can display iso-performance curves, rank correlation heatmaps, and classifier ranking regions.

- Critical path: For a new engineer, the critical path is understanding how to map importance weights to (a, b) parameters, compute the corresponding ranking score, and interpret its location on the Tile relative to standard scores.

- Design tradeoffs: The Tile sacrifices some precision (continuous scores are discretized in visualization) for comprehensiveness (all scores in one view). It also assumes fixed priors for ROC correspondence, which may not always hold.

- Failure signatures: If the Tile shows unexpected patterns, check: (1) whether the performance distribution is highly imbalanced, (2) if the priors used for ROC mapping are incorrect, or (3) if the rank correlation calculation is using an inappropriate performance sample.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Plot the canonical Tile with accuracy, F1, TPR, PPV, and NPV marked; verify their positions match theoretical expectations.
  2. For a simple binary classifier with known confusion matrix, compute its ROC curve and map it to the Tile to verify the pencil structure.
  3. Compute the rank correlation heatmap for a common score (e.g., Fβ) and verify it matches theoretical expectations at its Tile location.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of using the Volume Under Tile (VUT) score for ranking classifiers in terms of ranking stability and robustness compared to other established metrics like accuracy or F1-score?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that VUT has a high rank correlation with accuracy (Spearman's ρ about 0.996) for a uniform performance distribution.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes a high correlation between VUT and accuracy, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how VUT performs in terms of ranking stability and robustness in comparison to other metrics, especially in scenarios with imbalanced datasets or when the priors are not uniform.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting empirical studies comparing the ranking stability and robustness of VUT with other metrics across various datasets and scenarios, including those with class imbalance and non-uniform priors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Tile framework handle the trade-off between false positives and false negatives in real-world applications, and what are the implications for classifier selection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Tile is parameterized by two parameters that reflect application-specific preferences, one controlling the trade-off between true positives and true negatives, and the other balancing false positives and false negatives.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the Tile as a tool for visualizing and comparing ranking scores but does not provide specific guidance on how to set these parameters in real-world applications or how different settings impact classifier selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or examples demonstrating how to set the parameters in the Tile for different applications and the resulting impact on classifier selection and performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational complexities associated with using the Tile framework for large-scale classification tasks, and how does it scale with the number of classifiers and performance metrics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents the Tile as a comprehensive visual framework for ranking two-class classifiers but does not discuss its computational efficiency or scalability.
- Why unresolved: While the Tile is presented as a powerful tool for visualizing and comparing ranking scores, its practical applicability in large-scale scenarios with many classifiers and performance metrics is not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing the computational time and resource usage of the Tile framework with other ranking methods for large-scale classification tasks.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes all ranking scores can be expressed as linear combinations of confusion matrix outcomes, potentially excluding non-linear or threshold-dependent scores
- ROC space correspondence relies on fixed priors, which may not hold in practical scenarios with varying class distributions
- Rank correlation characterization depends on the choice of performance distribution, introducing potential bias in score interpretation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mathematical derivation of the Tile parameterization and the mapping of canonical scores to specific Tile locations
- **Medium Confidence**: The iso-performance line correspondence between ROC space and the Tile
- **Medium Confidence**: The rank correlation characterization method

## Next Checks
1. **Edge Case Testing**: Verify the Tile's behavior at boundary conditions (a=0, b=0, a=1, b=1) and for extreme performance values (all tp, all tn, etc.) to ensure mathematical consistency.

2. **Prior Sensitivity Analysis**: Test how sensitive the ROC-Tile correspondence is to changes in priors, and determine if the pencil structure remains valid under varying prior distributions.

3. **Distribution Dependence**: Systematically vary the performance distribution used for rank correlation calculations and assess how much the characterization results change, to quantify the method's robustness to distributional assumptions.
