core_contribution: This paper conducts a critical examination of scientific methodology
  in large language model (LLM) research by analyzing over 2,000 papers from 2020-2024.
  The study evaluates papers based on criteria typical of good research practices
  (e.g., statistical tests, reproducibility) and controversial claims (e.g., emergent
  behavior, LLM evaluators).

# Awes, Laws, and Flaws From Today's LLM Research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.15409
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15409
- Authors: Adrian de Wynter
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Critical analysis of LLM research methodology reveals widespread gaps in statistical rigor, reproducibility, and ethical practices

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates research methodology in over 2,000 LLM papers from 2020-2024, identifying significant gaps in scientific rigor. The analysis reveals that only 25% of papers claiming state-of-the-art results include statistical tests, while there's been a decline in ethics disclaimers and open-sourcing between 2023-2024. The study also finds concerning patterns in the use of LLM evaluators, which are often employed by papers making state-of-the-art claims. Despite these issues, the research identifies some positive trends, including steady limitations sections and increasing non-English evaluations.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a comprehensive automated analysis of 2,008 LLM research papers published between 2020 and 2024. Using a classification system, the study evaluates papers against criteria representing both good research practices (statistical tests, reproducibility, open-sourcing) and controversial claims (emergent behavior, LLM evaluators, reasoning abilities). The analysis tracks trends over time and examines correlations between methodology choices and research outcomes, particularly focusing on state-of-the-art claims and the use of LLM evaluators versus human evaluation.

## Key Results
- Only 25% of papers claiming state-of-the-art results include statistical tests
- There's been a decline in ethics disclaimers and open-sourcing between 2023-2024
- Papers using LLM evaluators are more likely to claim state-of-the-art results
- Claims of reasoning abilities are more frequently evaluated with LLMs than human evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's methodology works by systematically applying standardized evaluation criteria across a large corpus of research papers, enabling quantitative analysis of research practices and trends. The automated classification system allows for consistent measurement of methodology quality across different papers and time periods. By correlating methodology choices with research outcomes, the study identifies patterns that may indicate problematic practices or areas requiring improvement in the field.

## Foundational Learning
**Statistical Significance Testing**: Why needed - to validate claims of performance improvements and state-of-the-art results; Quick check - verify papers include p-values or confidence intervals for key comparisons.
**Reproducibility Practices**: Why needed - to enable independent verification of research findings; Quick check - confirm papers provide sufficient implementation details and data access.
**Ethics Disclaimers**: Why needed - to acknowledge potential harms and responsible use of LLM technology; Quick check - verify presence of ethical considerations section.
**Open-Sourcing**: Why needed - to promote transparency and enable community validation; Quick check - confirm availability of code and models.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Paper corpus -> Classification system -> Methodology criteria -> Statistical analysis -> Trend identification
**Critical Path**: Automated paper classification → Methodology evaluation → Statistical correlation analysis → Trend reporting
**Design Tradeoffs**: Automated classification enables large-scale analysis but may miss nuanced methodology details; correlation analysis identifies patterns but cannot establish causation.
**Failure Signatures**: Misclassification of methodology practices, overgeneralization of trends, confounding factors affecting statistical relationships.
**First Experiments**:
1. Manual verification of classification accuracy on a random sample of papers
2. Cross-validation with alternative classification systems
3. Sensitivity analysis of trend identification to classification thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Automated classification may not capture all nuances of research methodology
- Declining ethics disclaimers and open-sourcing could reflect changing norms rather than declining rigor
- Study doesn't account for field-specific variations in methodology requirements across LLM research sub-domains

## Confidence
- Statistical test reporting in state-of-the-art papers: High confidence
- Decline in ethics disclaimers and open-sourcing: Medium confidence
- Correlation between LLM evaluator usage and state-of-the-art claims: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Manually verify a random sample of 50 papers claiming state-of-the-art results to confirm automated classification accuracy of statistical test reporting.
2. Survey researchers about their methodology choices to understand whether declines in ethics disclaimers reflect reduced ethical consideration or changes in reporting conventions.
3. Conduct a follow-up study in 2025 to determine if identified trends are sustained or represent temporary fluctuations in research practices.
