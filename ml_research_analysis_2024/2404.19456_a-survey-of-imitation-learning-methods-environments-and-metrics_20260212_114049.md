# A Survey of Imitation Learning Methods, Environments and Metrics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.19456
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19456
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Systematic survey introducing taxonomies for imitation learning methods, environments, and metrics to address standardization gaps

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews the imitation learning field, focusing on methods, environments, and evaluation metrics. It introduces novel taxonomies for each, addressing the lack of standardization in the field. The survey covers 50+ papers and proposes a new classification of imitation learning methods based on the most prevalent learning techniques, such as adversarial learning and dynamics models. It also introduces the first taxonomy for imitation learning environments based on their role in the learning process (validation, precision, sequential) and metrics based on their meaning (behavior, domain, model). The survey highlights the need for consistent evaluation processes and environment usage to achieve a more systematic approach to imitation learning research.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology using snowballing from two prior surveys (Hussein et al. 2017 and Zheng et al. 2021). The authors analyze 50+ imitation learning papers, classifying methods into five categories (Adversarial, Behavioral Cloning, Dynamics Model, Hybrid, Online), environments into three roles (Validation, Precision, Sequential), and metrics into three types (Behavior, Domain, Model). The research identifies evaluation protocol inconsistencies and proposes standardized taxonomies to enable meaningful comparisons across studies.

## Key Results
- Proposed five-category taxonomy for imitation learning methods based on predominant learning techniques
- Introduced first-ever taxonomy classifying environments by their role in learning (validation, precision, sequential)
- Developed three-category framework for organizing evaluation metrics (behavior, domain, model)
- Documented significant inconsistencies in evaluation protocols across the field
- Identified key challenges including multi-task learning, learning from non-optimal teachers, and extension to multi-agent systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The survey resolves standardization issues by introducing taxonomies for methods, environments, and metrics that classify existing work into actionable categories.
- **Mechanism:** It creates a systematic framework where each imitation learning paper can be placed into one of five method categories, three environment roles, and three metric types. This allows researchers to compare apples-to-apples rather than using incomparable setups.
- **Core assumption:** All imitation learning work can be meaningfully categorized along these three dimensions without losing critical nuance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "introduces novel taxonomies for each, addressing the lack of standardization in the field"
  - [section 4] "propose the taxonomy with the main five categories given in Fig. 3"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't explicitly validate these taxonomies

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The survey's classification of environments by their role in learning (validation, precision, sequential) helps researchers select appropriate benchmarks.
- **Mechanism:** By distinguishing environments based on what they test (generalizability vs. precision vs. temporal planning), researchers can choose environments that actually stress the capabilities they want to measure rather than defaulting to popular but shallow benchmarks.
- **Core assumption:** Environment complexity correlates with the type of learning challenge it presents.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5] "we propose a threefold classification for these environments: (i) validation, which helps researchers to validate ideas without added complexity; (ii) precision, which helps to test agents that require less temporal modeling, but require precision; and (iii) sequential, which tests an agent's actions and their temporal consequences"
  - [section 5.1] "Validation environments are more straightforward simulations in general"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't discuss this environmental taxonomy

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The survey addresses the evaluation protocol inconsistency by documenting and analyzing the variety of metrics used across the literature.
- **Mechanism:** By cataloging 50 different metrics and organizing them into behavior, domain, and model categories with qualitative/quantitative subcategories, the survey reveals the evaluation landscape and highlights which metrics are actually comparable.
- **Core assumption:** Researchers can meaningfully compare results when they understand the metric landscape.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6] "We divided them into three different groups: behaviour, domain and model"
  - [section 6.4] "All work presented in Section 4 follow in some form the structure in Algorithm 1 when evaluating their method"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't engage with this metric taxonomy

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as the mathematical foundation for imitation learning
  - **Why needed here:** All imitation learning problems are formalized using MDPs, so understanding states, actions, transitions, and policies is essential for grasping how imitation learning methods work
  - **Quick check question:** In an MDP, if the agent observes state s and takes action a, what mathematical object determines the next state s'?

- **Concept:** Policy functions and their parameterization
  - **Why needed here:** Imitation learning methods all aim to learn a policy π that maps states to actions, and understanding how policies are parameterized (weights θ) is crucial for comparing different approaches
  - **Quick check question:** What's the difference between a stationary policy and a non-stationary policy in terms of their dependence on time/history?

- **Concept:** Trajectories, demonstrations, and observations as data sources
  - **Why needed here:** Different imitation learning methods use different types of data (full demonstrations with actions vs. observations without actions), and understanding these distinctions explains why methods have different requirements and capabilities
  - **Quick check question:** If you only have access to observations (state pairs), which imitation learning approach would you need to use?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Literature review -> MDP formalization -> Method taxonomy -> Environment taxonomy -> Metric taxonomy -> Discussion of challenges
- **Critical path:** For a new researcher, the critical path is: understand MDP formalization → grasp the method taxonomy → select appropriate environment category → choose relevant metrics → apply documented evaluation protocol
- **Design tradeoffs:** The survey trades depth in any single method for breadth across the field, making it a reference document rather than a tutorial. It also trades prescriptive recommendations for descriptive classification.
- **Failure signatures:** If a researcher tries to compare methods using different environment categories (e.g., validation vs. sequential) without accounting for the different challenges they present, the comparison will be misleading.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Take a recent imitation learning paper and classify it using the five-method taxonomy; verify it fits cleanly or identify edge cases
  2. Map the environments used in that paper to the validation/precision/sequential taxonomy; assess whether the environment choice matches the method's capabilities
  3. Extract the metrics used in that paper and categorize them using the behavior/domain/model framework; evaluate whether the metric choice provides a complete picture of performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can imitation learning methods be developed to learn effectively from non-optimal teachers while maintaining safety and adaptability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.2 discusses the challenges of learning from non-optimal teachers and the need for agents to learn safely and effectively.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper highlights the difficulties in ascertaining the optimality of demonstrations and the potential for non-optimal teachers to lead to unsafe or ineffective learning.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies demonstrating imitation learning methods that can learn effectively from non-optimal teachers while maintaining safety and adaptability, along with metrics to quantify these properties.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the most effective ways to evaluate imitation learning methods beyond traditional reward-based metrics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 discusses the limitations of reward-based metrics and the need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper argues that reward-based metrics can be misleading and do not capture the full complexity of imitation learning tasks, such as safety, adaptability, and human-likeness.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Research proposing and validating new evaluation metrics that capture a broader range of aspects relevant to imitation learning, along with empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of these metrics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can imitation learning be extended to multi-agent systems, where agents need to learn coordination and communication skills?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.4 identifies multi-agent systems as an under-explored area in imitation learning research.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper suggests that imitation learning is more suitable for low-level tasks, while multi-agent systems often require high-level skills like coordination and communication, which are not well-addressed by current imitation learning methods.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Novel imitation learning methods specifically designed for multi-agent systems, along with empirical studies demonstrating their effectiveness in learning coordination and communication skills.

## Limitations
- The method taxonomy may oversimplify hybrid approaches that combine multiple learning techniques
- The environmental taxonomy assumes clear distinctions between validation, precision, and sequential roles, but many modern environments serve multiple purposes
- The metric taxonomy may become outdated as new evaluation approaches emerge, particularly for multi-task and meta-imitation learning scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The survey successfully identifies and documents the lack of standardization in imitation learning research (abstract claim). The systematic literature review methodology is sound, and the identification of evaluation protocol inconsistencies is well-supported (section 6.4).
- **Medium confidence:** The three proposed taxonomies (methods, environments, metrics) are logically consistent and provide useful categorization frameworks. However, the taxonomies' completeness and ability to handle edge cases remains to be validated by the community (sections 4-6).
- **Low confidence:** The survey's claims about resolving standardization issues and enabling systematic comparison depend heavily on community adoption of the proposed taxonomies, which cannot be assessed from the survey alone.

## Next Checks
1. **Taxonomy Coverage Test:** Apply the five-method taxonomy to 10 recent imitation learning papers not included in the original survey corpus. Document cases where papers don't fit cleanly into any category or require multiple categories, and assess whether the taxonomy needs refinement.

2. **Environment Role Validation:** Select 5 environments used in current imitation learning research and evaluate whether they fit cleanly into the validation/precision/sequential classification. Identify environments that serve multiple roles and propose modifications to the taxonomy if needed.

3. **Metric Comparability Assessment:** Take 3 papers that claim to compare their method with baselines and analyze whether their metric choices (using the behavior/domain/model taxonomy) actually enable meaningful comparison. Document cases where different metric types make comparison misleading.
