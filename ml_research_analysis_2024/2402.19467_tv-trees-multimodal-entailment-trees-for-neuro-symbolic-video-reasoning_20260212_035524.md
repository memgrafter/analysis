# TV-TREES: Multimodal Entailment Trees for Neuro-Symbolic Video Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.19467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19467
- Authors: Kate Sanders; Nathaniel Weir; Benjamin Van Durme
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: State-of-the-art 49.4% zero-shot accuracy on TVQA benchmark using full-length clips

## Executive Summary
TV-TREES introduces a neuro-symbolic system that generates interpretable entailment trees for multimodal video reasoning. The method recursively searches for trees of entailment relationships between simple text-video evidence and higher-level conclusions to prove question-answer pairs. By emphasizing joint-modality reasoning and compositional evidence decomposition, TV-TREES achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the TVQA benchmark. The system provides interpretable reasoning traces and introduces the task of multimodal entailment tree generation for evaluating reasoning quality.

## Method Summary
TV-TREES is a recursive neuro-symbolic system that generates entailment trees to prove QA pairs through multimodal reasoning. The system first generates hypotheses from QA pairs using an LLM, then retrieves and filters evidence from video frames and dialogue transcripts using NLI classifiers and VQA models. When insufficient evidence is found, the system decomposes hypotheses into sub-hypotheses and recursively searches for proofs. The final entailment trees are evaluated using informal logic metrics (acceptability, relevance, and sufficiency) implemented through human annotations and GPT-4 evaluations. The approach achieves 49.4% accuracy on TVQA, outperforming existing methods while providing interpretable reasoning traces.

## Key Results
- Achieves 49.4% zero-shot accuracy on TVQA benchmark using full-length clips
- Outperforms existing methods by leveraging joint-modality evidence
- Demonstrates superior reasoning quality through interpretable entailment trees
- Ablation experiments show joint modality evidence improves both accuracy and tree completion rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal entailment trees enable interpretable reasoning by decomposing complex hypotheses into simpler sub-hypotheses that can be proven with atomic evidence.
- Mechanism: The system recursively retrieves evidence from video frames and dialogue transcripts, filters it using NLI classifiers and VQA models, and decomposes the hypothesis when insufficient evidence is found. This creates a tree structure showing the logical reasoning path.
- Core assumption: Complex video-language understanding can be broken down into compositional entailment relationships between simple text-video evidence and higher-level conclusions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TV-TREES serves as an approach to video understanding that promotes interpretable joint-modality reasoning by searching for trees of entailment relationships between simple text-video evidence and higher-level conclusions that prove question-answer pairs."
  - [section 3.1] "In a well-formed tree, the evidence e in any tree node (h, e) must explicitly entail the hypothesis h."
- Break condition: If the evidence retrieval or decomposition steps fail to find sufficient evidence, or if the NLI/VQA models cannot reliably classify entailment relationships, the tree generation will be incomplete or incorrect.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint modality reasoning improves accuracy over single-modality approaches by capturing complementary information from both video and dialogue.
- Mechanism: The system uses both visual and textual evidence in parallel, filtering and combining them to prove hypotheses. When textual evidence is insufficient, it falls back to visual evidence, and vice versa.
- Core assumption: Video-language understanding requires reasoning over both modalities simultaneously, as they provide complementary information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TV-TREES achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the TVQA benchmark using full-length clips, outperforming existing methods with 49.4% accuracy."
  - [section 4.4] "Finally, as the cross-encoder tends to ignore negation, we additionally pass the filtered inference-hypothesis pairs to a GPT-3.5 prompt to verify the entailment a final time."
- Break condition: If the visual and textual reasoning components are not well-calibrated or if one modality is consistently more reliable than the other, the joint reasoning may not provide significant benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Entailment tree evaluation using informal logic theory provides a reliable measure of reasoning quality beyond raw accuracy.
- Mechanism: The system evaluates generated trees using three metrics inspired by informal logic - acceptability, relevance, and sufficiency - implemented through human annotations and GPT-4 evaluations.
- Core assumption: The quality of a reasoning system can be assessed by how well it follows logical argumentation principles, not just by its final answer accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Informal logic theory posits that natural language arguments may be evaluated in terms of their acceptability, relevance, and sufficiency (Johnson and Blair, 1977), and we consider each node in an entailment tree as an 'argument' to be scored using these qualia."
  - [section 5] "We consider the mean normalized score of the three main evaluation qualia across all nodes as the overall 'composition score' for each individual tree."
- Break condition: If the evaluation metrics do not accurately capture human judgments of reasoning quality, or if the human and GPT-4 evaluations diverge significantly, the evaluation method may not be reliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Language Inference (NLI) and entailment relationships
  - Why needed here: The system relies on NLI models to classify whether evidence entails hypotheses, which is the core logical operation in entailment tree generation.
  - Quick check question: Given the premise "The cat is on the mat" and the hypothesis "The mat is under the cat", would an NLI model classify this as entailment, contradiction, or neutral?

- Concept: Video-language representation and cross-modal reasoning
  - Why needed here: The system needs to represent and reason over both video and language inputs, requiring an understanding of how to extract meaningful features from both modalities and combine them.
  - Quick check question: What are some common approaches for representing video content in language models, and how do they differ from text-only representations?

- Concept: Recursive problem decomposition and compositional reasoning
  - Why needed here: The system recursively decomposes complex hypotheses into simpler sub-hypotheses, requiring an understanding of how to break down problems and reason compositionally.
  - Quick check question: Given the complex hypothesis "The person in the blue shirt is holding a red ball", what are some possible ways to decompose it into simpler sub-hypotheses?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Hypothesis generation (LLM) -> Evidence localization (cross-encoder) -> Evidence retrieval (LLM inference generation) -> Evidence filtering (NLI classifiers, VQA models) -> Hypothesis decomposition (LLM) -> Tree scoring (human/GPT-4 evaluations)

- Critical path: Hypothesis generation → Evidence localization → Evidence retrieval → Evidence filtering → Hypothesis decomposition (if needed) → Tree scoring

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. interpretability: The system prioritizes interpretability through entailment trees, which may sacrifice some accuracy compared to black-box approaches.
  - Modality balance: The system needs to balance the contributions of visual and textual evidence, which may require careful tuning.
  - Evaluation reliability: The system relies on human and GPT-4 evaluations, which may have their own biases and limitations.

- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete trees: If the system cannot find sufficient evidence to prove a hypothesis, the tree may be incomplete or have null leaves.
  - Incorrect decompositions: If the hypothesis decomposition step fails to produce compositionally equivalent sub-hypotheses, the tree may be logically incorrect.
  - Evaluation mismatches: If the human and GPT-4 evaluations disagree significantly, it may indicate issues with the evaluation method or the generated trees.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the system on a small set of TVQA questions with known answers to verify basic functionality.
  2. Evaluate the system's performance with different combinations of visual and textual evidence to assess the impact of joint modality reasoning.
  3. Compare the system's generated trees with human-created entailment trees for a subset of questions to assess tree quality and reasoning accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on human and GPT-4 annotations, which may introduce subjective biases and limit scalability.
- System performance is dependent on quality of underlying NLI and VQA models, which may struggle with complex visual reasoning or subtle textual entailment relationships.
- Decomposition module effectiveness is limited by quality of generated sub-hypotheses and their compositional equivalence to original hypothesis.
- Reliance on full-length video clips may pose computational challenges for longer videos.

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Multimodal entailment trees): Medium - While the approach is well-motivated, the evaluation relies on human/GPT-4 annotations which may introduce subjectivity.
- Mechanism 2 (Joint modality reasoning): High - The ablation experiments clearly show the benefits of joint modality evidence over single-modality approaches.
- Mechanism 3 (Entailment tree evaluation): Low - The evaluation metrics are novel and rely heavily on human and GPT-4 judgments, which may not align perfectly with true reasoning quality.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a human study comparing TV-TREES' generated trees with human-created entailment trees for a subset of TVQA questions to assess tree quality and reasoning accuracy.
2. Evaluate the system's performance with different combinations of NLI and VQA models to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
3. Test the system on a diverse set of video-language understanding tasks beyond TVQA to assess its generalizability and robustness to different domains and question types.
