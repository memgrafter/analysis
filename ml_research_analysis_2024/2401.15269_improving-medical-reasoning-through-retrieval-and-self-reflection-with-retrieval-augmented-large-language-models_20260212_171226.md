# Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15269
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 7.2% average absolute improvement over state-of-the-art open-foundation model on medical QA benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Self-BioRAG, a framework that enhances biomedical and clinical text generation through retrieval and self-reflection. The framework combines domain-specific components including a specialized retriever, biomedical corpus, and instruction sets with a self-assessment mechanism using reflective tokens. By training on 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets, Self-BioRAG can generate explanations, retrieve relevant documents, and self-reflect on its responses. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains on three major medical question-answering benchmarks, with an average 7.2% improvement over state-of-the-art open-foundation models with 7B or fewer parameters.

## Method Summary
Self-BioRAG trains a generator model using 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets and four types of reflective tokens (retrieval necessity, evidence relevance, answer support, overall utility) annotated by GPT-4. The framework uses a domain-specific retriever (MedCPT) and biomedical corpus (PubMed, PMC, CPG, medical textbooks). During inference, the model predicts whether retrieval is needed, retrieves relevant documents if necessary, selects the best evidence based on weighted reflective token scores, and generates answers with self-assessment tokens. The critic model predicts reflective tokens while the generator model produces answers using retrieved evidence and encoded knowledge.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.2% average absolute improvement over state-of-the-art open-foundation models (7B parameters or less) on medical QA benchmarks
- Outperforms RAG by 8% in Rouge-1 score on two long-form question-answering benchmarks
- Shows consistent performance gains whether or not retrieved evidence is used, demonstrating effective adaptive retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain-specific components are necessary for biomedical tasks
- Evidence: Self-BioRAG outperforms general-purpose approaches; critic LM from Self-RAG unsuitable for biomedical domains
- Core assumption: General-purpose retrievers and corpora are insufficient for biomedical tasks
- Break condition: If general-purpose retrievers show comparable performance on biomedical benchmarks

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive retrieval improves performance by conditionally retrieving evidence
- Evidence: Adaptive retrieval shows comparable performance to forced retrieval on average
- Core assumption: Not all biomedical questions require external evidence
- Break condition: If forced retrieval consistently outperforms adaptive retrieval across benchmarks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reflective tokens enable effective self-assessment and answer quality control
- Evidence: Model generates answers with four types of reflective tokens for self-assessment
- Core assumption: Model can accurately self-assess using reflective token framework
- Break condition: If reflective tokens don't correlate with human judgment of answer quality

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Biomedical Instruction Sets → Generator Model → Critic Model → MedCPT Retriever → Biomedical Corpora → Retrieved Evidence
- Critical path: Question → Retrieval Decision → Evidence Retrieval → Evidence Selection → Answer Generation with Reflective Tokens
- Design tradeoffs: Domain specialization vs. general applicability; Adaptive retrieval vs. forced retrieval; Reflective token granularity vs. model complexity; Corpus size vs. retrieval efficiency
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on biomedical benchmarks; Inconsistent reflective token predictions; Low retrieval accuracy
- First 3 experiments: 1) Test baseline LLaMA2 performance on MedQA; 2) Evaluate RAG with MedCPT retriever on same benchmark; 3) Run Self-BioRAG with adaptive retrieval disabled

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific reflective tokens could be explored for different biomedical domains?
- Basis: Paper mentions exploring other reflective tokens suitable for specific domains as future work
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't provide details on which specific reflective tokens could be beneficial
- What evidence would resolve it: Research comparing performance with different reflective tokens tailored to specific biomedical domains

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does Self-BioRAG's performance vary with different parameter sizes?
- Basis: Paper mentions 7B and 13B parameter performance but no comprehensive analysis
- Why unresolved: No analysis of how performance scales across parameter sizes for various biomedical tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating performance with range of parameter sizes on multiple biomedical tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific limitations of using retrieved evidence in biomedical QA?
- Basis: Paper discusses challenges of using retrieved evidence like introducing errors from noisy information
- Why unresolved: No detailed strategies for mitigating limitations of retrieved evidence
- What evidence would resolve it: Research on methods to filter irrelevant evidence and better integrate with encoded knowledge

## Limitations
- Limited ablation testing to isolate individual component contributions to the 7.2% improvement
- Generalization concerns with performance demonstrated on only two long-form benchmarks
- No human validation of reflective token accuracy or effectiveness

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- Self-BioRAG outperforms baseline models on established medical benchmarks
- Domain-specific components improve biomedical text generation
- Adaptive retrieval performs comparably to forced retrieval while reducing noise

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- 7.2% improvement represents meaningful advancement
- Reflective tokens effectively guide self-assessment
- Framework architecture successfully mimics medical expert reasoning

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Reflective tokens accurately predict answer quality without external validation
- Framework generalizes to all biomedical and clinical applications
- Performance improvements are solely due to proposed innovations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of domain-specific components
2. Evaluate Self-BioRAG on biomedical datasets not seen during training, including clinical notes and patient records
3. Perform human evaluation of reflective token effectiveness by medical experts comparing against human judgments
