# What Would Happen Next? Predicting Consequences from An Event Causality Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17480
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17480
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: SeDGPL achieves MRR of 27.9 and Hit@1 of 21.9 on CGEP-MA VEN, and MRR of 19.6 and Hit@1 of 15.2 on CGEP-ESC

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Causality Graph Event Prediction (CGEP) task that predicts consequential events based on Event Causality Graphs (ECGs), departing from traditional script event chain approaches. The authors propose SeDGPL, a Semantic Enhanced Distance-sensitive Graph Prompt Learning model with three modules: DsGL for graph linearization, EeCE for event enrichment, and ScEP for contrastive learning. Experiments on two constructed datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over advanced competitors, validating the effectiveness of using ECGs for event prediction.

## Method Summary
The SeDGPL model reformulates ECGs into graph prompt templates through distance-sensitive linearization, then enriches event representations by integrating contextual semantic and graph schema information via fusion gates. A semantic contrastive learning module enhances discrimination among numerous candidate events. The model is trained using cross entropy loss combined with supervised contrastive loss, leveraging pre-trained RoBERTa-base as the PLM encoder. Two datasets (CGEP-MA VEN and CGEP-ESC) are constructed from existing event causality corpora for evaluation.

## Key Results
- MRR of 27.9 and Hit@1 of 21.9 on CGEP-MA VEN dataset
- MRR of 19.6 and Hit@1 of 15.2 on CGEP-ESC dataset
- Significant performance improvements over advanced baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Distance-sensitive graph linearization improves prediction by ordering causality triples based on their proximity to the anchor event.
- Mechanism: The DsGL module calculates shortest undirected path distances from cause events to the anchor event, then arranges causality triples in decreasing order of distance in the graph prompt template.
- Core assumption: Events closer to the anchor event in the causality graph provide more critical information for predicting consequential events.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions graph prompt template input; [section] describes distance calculation; [corpus] provides weak direct evidence.
- Break condition: If causality chains are too long or complex, distance ordering may prioritize irrelevant local patterns over global context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Event representation enrichment through contextual semantic and schema information fusion improves prediction accuracy.
- Mechanism: The EeCE module integrates event contextual semantic from raw sentences and graph schema information from event type graphs using fusion gates to create enriched event representations.
- Core assumption: Event contextual semantic and graph schema information are complementary and their combination provides more discriminative features than either alone.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions integration of both information types; [section] describes fusion gate mechanism; [corpus] provides weak direct evidence.
- Break condition: If contextual and schema information conflict or if one source is significantly noisier than the other.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semantic contrastive learning enhances the PLM's ability to distinguish among numerous candidate events.
- Mechanism: The ScEP module applies supervised contrastive loss using the [MASK] token representation as anchor and candidate event representations as contrastive samples, with ground truth as positive and others as negatives.
- Core assumption: Contrastive learning between candidate events improves the discriminative power of the event representation space.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions enhancing event representation among candidates; [section] describes supervised contrastive loss; [corpus] provides weak direct evidence.
- Break condition: If candidate set size becomes too large relative to available training data, contrastive learning may become unstable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph prompt learning
  - Why needed here: Traditional PLMs struggle with graph-structured inputs, so linearization is required to leverage pre-trained knowledge for graph-based tasks
  - Quick check question: How does graph linearization preserve structural information while making it compatible with PLM input requirements?

- Concept: Event causality graph construction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to build ECGs from raw text is essential for dataset creation and task formulation
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a valid ECG from other graph representations of events in terms of causal relationships?

- Concept: Contrastive learning for event representation
  - Why needed here: The task involves selecting from a large candidate set, requiring strong discriminative representations between similar events
  - Quick check question: How does supervised contrastive loss differ from self-supervised contrastive approaches in terms of label requirements and learning objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ECG → DsGL → EeCE → ScEP → Event prediction
- Critical path: ECG → DsGL → EeCE → ScEP → Event prediction
  The most performance-critical components are EeCE (for representation quality) and ScEP (for discrimination in large candidate sets).
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Graph linearization vs. graph neural networks: Linearization leverages PLM knowledge but loses explicit graph structure; GNNs preserve structure but lack pre-trained knowledge
  - Distance ordering vs. random ordering: Distance ordering prioritizes relevant information but may miss long-range dependencies
  - Contrastive learning vs. classification: Contrastive learning provides better discrimination but requires more computation
- Failure signatures:
  - Low Hit@1 but high Hit@10: Model struggles to identify the most likely event but captures the general event type
  - Poor performance on longer graphs: Distance ordering may fail when relevant information is far from anchor
  - Overfitting to training graphs: Model memorizes specific graph patterns rather than learning general causality reasoning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation test: Remove distance sensitivity (random ordering) to measure its impact on performance
  2. Scale test: Vary candidate set size to evaluate contrastive learning effectiveness
  3. Cross-domain test: Apply trained model to a different event causality corpus to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of SeDGPL vary when using different pre-trained language models as the base encoder, particularly comparing transformer-based models with other architectures like convolutional or recurrent networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses RoBERTa-base as the PLM but does not explore alternative architectures or compare performance across different PLM types.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of SeDGPL using RoBERTa-base without exploring the impact of different PLM architectures on performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing SeDGPL's performance using different base encoders (e.g., BERT, T5, convolutional models) on the same CGEP datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of candidate events on model performance, and is there an optimal candidate set size that balances computational efficiency with prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using 512 and 256 candidates for CGEP-MA VEN and CGEP-ESC respectively, but does not systematically explore how varying this number affects performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper uses different candidate set sizes for different datasets, it does not investigate the relationship between candidate set size and model performance across a range of values.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying candidate set sizes (e.g., 128, 256, 512, 1024) and measuring corresponding changes in MRR and Hit@n metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SeDGPL perform on event causality graphs with different structural properties, such as graphs with varying densities, cycles, or disconnected components?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper constructs ECGs with specific constraints (e.g., weakly connected graphs with >4 nodes) but does not analyze performance across different graph structural characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an analysis of how SeDGPL's performance is affected by different graph structures, which could reveal important limitations or strengths of the approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance evaluation on datasets containing graphs with varying densities, cycles, disconnected components, and other structural variations, with corresponding analysis of performance patterns.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the contribution of each component in the Event-Enriched Causality Encoding module to the overall performance, and how do they interact with each other?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper ablates individual components (contextual semantic, schema information, contrastive learning) but does not perform a comprehensive analysis of component interactions or combined effects.
- Why unresolved: While individual component ablation is performed, the paper does not explore how different combinations of components or their interactions contribute to overall performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed ablation study exploring all possible combinations of the EeCE module components and analyzing their interactions and combined effects on performance metrics.

## Limitations

- Dataset construction methodology is not fully specified, making it difficult to assess generalizability
- Performance metrics still indicate significant challenge with Hit@1 scores around 15-22%
- Ablation studies are limited, particularly lacking analysis of distance sensitivity and contrastive learning components

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of using graph prompt learning for event prediction is well-grounded and the overall architecture design is sound. The experimental results showing improvements over baselines are reliable.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the three proposed modules (DsGL, EeCE, ScEP) is supported by the experimental results, though the specific mechanisms could benefit from more detailed analysis. The dataset construction process is described but not fully detailed.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that distance sensitivity specifically improves performance lacks strong empirical support, as no direct comparison with random ordering is provided. The contrastive learning component's effectiveness is demonstrated but could be more rigorously evaluated.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study with Random Ordering**: Implement an ablation test comparing the distance-sensitive graph linearization against random ordering of causality triples to quantify the specific contribution of the distance ordering mechanism to overall performance.

2. **Cross-Domain Evaluation**: Test the trained SeDGPL model on a third, independent event causality corpus from a different domain (e.g., news articles vs. literature) to assess the model's ability to generalize beyond the specific datasets used in training.

3. **Candidate Set Size Analysis**: Conduct experiments varying the candidate set size (e.g., 128, 256, 512, 1024) to determine the scalability limits of the contrastive learning approach and identify at what point performance degradation becomes significant.
