# Multi-modal Data Binding for Survival Analysis Modeling with Incomplete Data and Annotations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.17726
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17726
- **Reference count**: 21
- **Primary result**: Concordance index improvements of 1-2% over state-of-the-art methods on overall survival and disease-free survival prediction tasks

## Executive Summary
This work addresses survival analysis in cancer treatment by jointly handling incomplete multi-modal data and censored survival labels. The method leverages modality-specific foundation models for feature encoding, aligns features across modalities via contrastive learning, and introduces progressive survival disambiguation learning to estimate risks for censored patients. Experiments on two colorectal cancer datasets show the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The framework encodes individual modalities using specialized foundation models (PLIP for pathology, MedSAM-3D for radiology, BioLinkBERT for clinical notes), aggregates features using attention mechanisms for both intra- and inter-modality fusion, aligns embeddings across modalities using contrastive learning with memory queues, and handles censored labels through progressive survival disambiguation learning that generates pseudo labels and incorporates uncertainty. The method is trained end-to-end with a combination of contrastive loss, uncensored survival loss, and censored survival loss components.

## Key Results
- Achieved concordance index improvements of 1-2% over state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrated robust performance across scenarios with missing modalities
- Showed superior handling of censored labels compared to existing approaches
- Validated on two colorectal cancer datasets with 367 and 193 patients respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method effectively addresses both missing modalities and censored labels by integrating foundation models with a novel contrastive alignment and progressive disambiguation learning strategy
- Mechanism: By encoding each modality using specialized foundation models, the method creates modality-specific embeddings. These embeddings are then aligned into a universal representation space using contrastive learning with memory queues, enabling effective fusion even when some modalities are missing. The progressive survival disambiguation learning component addresses censored labels by generating pseudo labels and incorporating uncertainty during training, allowing the model to estimate risks for censored patients
- Core assumption: The assumption is that modality-specific foundation models can effectively capture the unique characteristics of each data type, and that the alignment process can create a cohesive joint embedding space despite missing modalities
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Our approach employs advanced foundation models to encode individual modalities and align them into a universal representation space for seamless fusion."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of attention-based multi-instance aggregation for both intra-modality and inter-modality feature fusion improves the model's ability to handle variable numbers of instances and quantify the importance of each modality
- Mechanism: The method uses attention mechanisms to aggregate feature vectors within each modality (intra-modality) and across all modalities (inter-modality). This allows the model to flexibly handle varying numbers of instances per patient and to assign importance weights to different modalities based on their relevance to the survival outcome
- Core assumption: The assumption is that attention mechanisms can effectively capture the relative importance of different instances and modalities, leading to improved feature representation and prediction accuracy
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "We address these issues by unifying the aggregation of intra-modal and inter-modal features into a problem of multi-instance aggregation based on the attention mechanism, offering a flexible and efficient solution."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The progressive survival disambiguation learning component improves the model's ability to estimate risks for censored patients by generating pseudo labels and incorporating uncertainty
- Mechanism: The method uses a prediction layer to estimate risks for each time interval and then uses the censored time to retain hazards for subsequent intervals while setting earlier intervals to zero. Softmax is applied to normalize these predictions, and they are then used to weight the ground-truth label to form soft labels for training. A time-dependent Gaussian warming-up function is used to gradually increase the weight of these pseudo labels
- Core assumption: The assumption is that generating pseudo labels and incorporating uncertainty can effectively estimate risks for censored patients, and that the time-dependent Gaussian warming-up function can help the model gradually learn to handle censored data
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "By generating pseudo labels and incorporating uncertainty in the training of censored data, we significantly improve the predictive accuracy of survival prediction."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Survival Analysis
  - Why needed here: Understanding survival analysis is crucial for comprehending the problem the paper addresses and the significance of its contributions. It involves predicting the time until an event of interest occurs, which in this case is related to cancer treatment outcomes
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the context of cancer treatment?

- Concept: Multi-modal Data Fusion
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with integrating information from multiple modalities (e.g., pathology images, radiology images, clinical notes) to improve survival predictions. Understanding how to effectively fuse these diverse data types is essential for grasping the proposed method's approach
  - Quick check question: What are the challenges associated with fusing information from multiple modalities, and how does the paper address these challenges?

- Concept: Handling Missing Data and Censored Labels
  - Why needed here: Real-world survival analysis often involves incomplete data (missing modalities) and censored labels (where the event of interest has not occurred or is unknown). Understanding how to handle these issues is critical for evaluating the proposed method's effectiveness
  - Quick check question: What are the potential biases introduced by incomplete data and censored labels, and how does the paper mitigate these biases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pathology Images -> PLIP Foundation Model -> Pathology Features; Radiology Images -> MedSAM-3D Foundation Model -> Radiology Features; Clinical Notes -> BioLinkBERT Foundation Model -> Clinical Features; All Features -> Attention-based Aggregation -> Joint Embedding Space -> Contrastive Learning Alignment -> Progressive Survival Disambiguation -> Survival Prediction

- Critical path: 1. Encode modalities using foundation models; 2. Aggregate features using attention mechanisms; 3. Align embeddings using contrastive learning; 4. Estimate risks for censored patients using progressive survival disambiguation learning; 5. Make survival predictions using the prediction layer

- Design tradeoffs: Using modality-specific foundation models increases encoding precision but requires more computational resources and model management; Attention-based aggregation offers flexibility but may be computationally expensive for large datasets; Contrastive learning with memory queues improves alignment but requires careful tuning of queue size and update frequency; Progressive survival disambiguation learning addresses censored labels but introduces additional complexity and hyperparameters

- Failure signatures: Poor performance on survival prediction tasks; Inaccurate risk estimation for censored patients; Sensitivity to missing modalities during testing; Overfitting to training data

- First 3 experiments: 1. Evaluate the impact of modality-specific foundation models on feature encoding quality by comparing the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that uses a single general foundation model for all modalities; 2. Assess the effectiveness of attention-based multi-instance aggregation by comparing the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that uses simple averaging or max-pooling for feature aggregation; 3. Investigate the impact of progressive survival disambiguation learning on handling censored labels by comparing the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that ignores censored data or uses a simpler approach to handle it

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the progressive survival disambiguation learning handle varying censoring intervals across different patients?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that censored patients have unknown interval hazards and proposes using softmax-normalized predictions weighted by ground-truth labels, but doesn't specify how different censoring times affect the pseudo-label generation
- Why unresolved: The paper describes the general framework but lacks details on how censoring intervals of different lengths are handled in practice
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed explanation of how the pseudo-label generation process adapts to different censoring intervals and experimental results showing performance across varying censoring distributions

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the three loss components (contrastive loss, uncensored survival loss, and censored survival loss) across different clinical scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses fixed coefficients λcon and λcen in experiments but doesn't explore how these should vary based on dataset characteristics like modality completeness or censoring rate
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate how loss weighting should adapt to different clinical data characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies showing how performance varies with different loss weightings across datasets with different missing modality rates and censoring levels

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework's performance degrade as the number of modalities decreases below the tested scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests scenarios with various missing modalities but doesn't explore the minimum number of modalities required for acceptable performance
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate performance thresholds or identify the most critical modality combinations
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically removing modalities to identify performance thresholds and sensitivity analysis showing which modalities contribute most to performance

### Open Question 4
- Question: How transferable is the model to different cancer types beyond colorectal cancer?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests on two colorectal cancer datasets but doesn't explore cross-cancer generalization or fine-tuning requirements for other cancer types
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single cancer type without investigating generalizability
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the framework on multiple cancer types, including cross-cancer validation and analysis of which components transfer well versus require adaptation

## Limitations
- Evaluation is constrained to two specific cancer types (colorectal cancer) and six predefined modalities, limiting broader applicability
- The method's performance on datasets with higher proportions of missing modalities remains unclear
- Computational overhead from using multiple foundation models may limit real-world deployment

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of combining foundation models with contrastive learning for multi-modal fusion is well-grounded and supported by extensive prior work
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of the Progressive Survival Disambiguation Learning component, particularly pseudo-label generation and uncertainty weighting, are not fully specified
- **Low confidence**: The exact hyperparameter settings (λ values, adapter configurations) and their sensitivity to dataset characteristics

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on progressive survival disambiguation**: Remove this component and measure performance degradation specifically for censored patients to quantify its impact
2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Apply the framework to a different cancer type or medical domain with different modality combinations to assess transferability
3. **Missing modality robustness analysis**: Systematically vary the proportion of missing modalities during testing to identify breaking points and evaluate robustness under extreme scenarios
