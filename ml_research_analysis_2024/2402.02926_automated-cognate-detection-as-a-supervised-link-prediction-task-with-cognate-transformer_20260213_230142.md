# Automated Cognate Detection as a Supervised Link Prediction Task with Cognate Transformer

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.02926
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02926
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: Cognate Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple language families when sufficient labeled data is available

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a supervised transformer-based approach for automated cognate detection that processes multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of words across languages to predict cognacy linkages. The Cognate Transformer model, enhanced with triangle multiplication and attention modules, learns regular sound correspondences from labeled cognate clusters without requiring explicit phonological rules. The method demonstrates superior performance to existing approaches like LexStat-Infomap and SVM on several language families when trained with sufficient supervision, while also being more computationally efficient by avoiding pairwise computations.

## Method Summary
The approach accepts MSAs of words in the same concept across different languages as input, converting them to ASJP representation and tokenizing with language information. A Cognate Transformer processes the MSA using row-wise and column-wise attention, followed by an outer product mean module to convert embeddings into pairwise representations. A pairwise module with triangle multiplication and attention refines these representations before a classifier predicts linkage probabilities. The model is trained end-to-end using cross-entropy loss on labeled cognate data, and predictions are clustered using UPGMA at a threshold of 0.6. The method is evaluated on multiple language families using B-Cubed F-score, showing performance gains over state-of-the-art methods when sufficient training data is available.

## Key Results
- With sufficient training data (20+ concepts per family), the model achieves higher B-Cubed F-scores than LexStat-Infomap and SVM on several language families
- Ablation studies show the triangle-based pairwise module is crucial for performance improvements
- The model learns regular sound correspondences from examples, though this capability is primarily anecdotal
- Performance is highly dependent on supervision levels, with gains becoming significant above certain thresholds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Cognate Transformer with triangle-based modules learns regular sound correspondences directly from labeled cognate clusters without requiring explicit phonological rules.
- Mechanism: The transformer processes multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of words across languages. The triangle multiplication and attention modules capture transitivity among cognate linkages, which implicitly encodes phonological patterns like regular sound correspondences. The model maps phoneme patterns to cognate clusters through supervised learning on labeled data.
- Core assumption: Sufficient labeled cognate examples exist to learn regular sound correspondences without explicit phonological feature engineering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model learns regular sound correspondences from examples"
  - [section] "The fundamental aspect for comparing two languages is to identify regular sound correspondences... In this regard, we note that CogTran2 appears to have learned some recurrent sound correspondences by observing the initial consonant"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains no direct citations about sound correspondence learning mechanisms.
- Break condition: Insufficient training data per language family to capture the variety of sound correspondences, or when the phonological patterns are too irregular or influenced by borrowings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: End-to-end MSA processing with link prediction avoids expensive pairwise computations while improving performance.
- Mechanism: Instead of computing similarity scores for every language pair separately, the model takes the entire MSA as input and directly predicts linkage probabilities. The outer product mean module converts the MSA embeddings into pairwise representations, and the pairwise module with triangle operations refines these representations before classification.
- Core assumption: MSA representation contains sufficient information to predict pairwise linkages without computing independent pairwise scores.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "accepting multiple sequence alignments as input and having an end-to-end architecture with link prediction head saves much computation time while simultaneously yielding superior performance"
  - [section] "Our method consists of an end-to-end architecture that avoids independent pairwise computations by accepting MSA as input and directly predicting cluster linkages, which proves to be more efficient in terms of both performance and time than a pairwise approach"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in the corpus about MSA-based approaches versus pairwise methods.
- Break condition: When the MSA contains too many gaps or misalignments that obscure the pairwise relationship patterns, or when the number of languages per concept becomes very large.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Supervised learning with labeled cognate clusters provides significant performance gains over unsupervised similarity-based methods.
- Mechanism: The model uses cross-entropy loss on labeled cognate data to train the link prediction head, learning to distinguish cognates from non-cognates based on the patterns in the training data. The supervision allows the model to capture language-specific cognacy patterns that unsupervised methods miss.
- Core assumption: Labeled cognate data contains information about cognacy patterns that can be learned by a neural network architecture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Beyond a certain amount of supervision, this method performs better than the existing methods, and shows steady improvement with further increase in supervision"
  - [section] "Previous state-of-the-art methods for cognate identification... make little or no use of the cognacy labels except for a clustering task at the end. In this paper, we advocate for a supervised learning scenario that utilizes the labeled information to the fullest"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence about supervised vs unsupervised cognate detection performance.
- Break condition: When labeled training data is insufficient or contains too many errors, or when the cognacy patterns are too complex for the model to learn from limited examples.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
  - Why needed here: The model requires aligned word forms across languages to capture phonological patterns and compute meaningful pairwise representations.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why simply concatenating words from different languages without alignment would be insufficient for detecting cognates?

- Concept: Supervised Link Prediction
  - Why needed here: The model needs labeled cognate/non-cognate pairs to learn the patterns that distinguish related words from unrelated ones.
  - Quick check question: What would happen if you trained the model without supervision (i.e., without labeled cognate clusters)?

- Concept: Triangle Inequalities in Graph Structures
  - Why needed here: The triangle modules enforce transitivity constraints on cognacy predictions, which reflects the linguistic reality that cognates form transitive clusters.
  - Quick check question: Why is transitivity an important property for cognate clusters, and how might violations of transitivity manifest in the predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MSA → Cognate Transformer → Outer Product Mean → Pairwise Module → Classifier → UPGMA clustering
- Critical path: MSA → Cognate Transformer → Outer Product Mean → Pairwise Module → Classifier → UPGMA clustering
- Design tradeoffs:
  - MSA input vs pairwise input: MSA is faster but requires alignment quality; pairwise is slower but more flexible
  - Triangle modules vs no triangle modules: Triangle modules improve accuracy but add complexity
  - Supervised vs unsupervised: Supervised requires labeled data but performs better with sufficient supervision
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor alignment quality leading to misaligned phoneme positions
  - Insufficient labeled data per language family
  - Overfitting on small datasets with complex language-specific patterns
  - Memory issues with large MSAs (many languages or long sequences)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with MSA input but without triangle modules to measure their contribution
  2. Train with aligned word pairs instead of MSA to compare speed vs accuracy
  3. Test with varying amounts of supervision (0%, 12.5%, 50% additional training data) to identify the supervision threshold for performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the model's ability to learn regular sound correspondences be quantitatively validated beyond anecdotal examples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the model appears to learn sound correspondences through examples like PIE *s > Ancient Greek h, but acknowledges that a thorough quantitative analysis requires annotated data that is not readily available.
- Why unresolved: There is currently no annotated dataset of sound correspondences available for validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dataset of annotated sound correspondences that could be used to systematically test the model's predictions against known phonological changes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does the model underperform on Austronesian, Pama-Nyungan, and Sino-Tibetan language families compared to other datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the model lags behind SVM and LexStat-Infomap on Austronesian and Pama-Nyungan datasets, and that Sino-Tibetan has the lowest B-Cubed F-scores among all datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests linguistic expertise is needed to identify bottlenecks, but does not provide specific analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Linguistic analysis of the structural or phonological features of these language families that may pose challenges for the model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would incorporating the Evoformer module structure from AlphaFold2 improve performance on cognate detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the pairwise module is currently separate from the Cognate Transformer, and notes that it's unclear if embedding these modules within an Evoformer-like structure would improve performance.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture uses a simpler stacking approach rather than the more complex Evoformer structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing of a model architecture that embeds the MSA and pairwise modules within an Evoformer-like structure.

## Limitations
- Performance highly dependent on supervision levels, with significant degradation below 20 concepts per language family
- Underperforms on certain language families (Austronesian, Pama-Nyungan, Sino-Tibetan) that require further linguistic analysis
- Limited evaluation of partial cognacy scenarios where words share some but not all morphemes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mechanism of using MSA input to avoid pairwise computations is well-supported by the architectural description and efficiency claims.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim about learning regular sound correspondences from examples is plausible given the transformer architecture but lacks direct empirical evidence from the paper.
- **Medium confidence**: The performance superiority over existing methods is supported by quantitative results, though the ablation studies could be more comprehensive.
- **Low confidence**: The generalization claims across all tested language families are uncertain given the noted difficulties with specific families like Austronesian and Chinese.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study with varying supervision levels**: Systematically test the model with 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100% of available labeled data to precisely identify the supervision threshold where performance gains become significant, and whether the model degrades gracefully below this threshold.

2. **Cross-family generalization test**: Train the model on one language family (e.g., Indo-European) and evaluate on completely unseen families (e.g., Austronesian or Chinese) to assess whether the learned sound correspondence patterns transfer across linguistic distances, or if family-specific training is necessary.

3. **Partial cognacy evaluation**: Create or identify test datasets with partial cognacy annotations (where words share some but not all morphemes) to evaluate how well the model handles this linguistic reality, and whether the current UPGMA clustering threshold of 0.6 is optimal for different cognacy scenarios.
