# Value Identification in Multistakeholder Recommender Systems for Humanities and Historical Research: The Case of the Digital Archive Monasterium.net

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17769
- Reference count: 35
- This paper identifies and analyzes the key stakeholder groups in a multistakeholder recommender system for Monasterium.net, a digital archive of historical legal documents.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines the complex landscape of stakeholder interests in recommender systems for humanities and historical research, using the Monasterium.net digital archive as a case study. The research identifies and maps the diverse values and objectives of multiple stakeholder groups, including editors, aggregators, platform owners, researchers, publishers, and funding agencies. By analyzing potential conflicts and design considerations, the study provides foundational insights for developing value-aware recommender systems that can balance competing needs while enhancing the discovery and use of cultural heritage records.

## Method Summary
The research employs a stakeholder analysis methodology to identify and categorize the different groups involved in the Monasterium.net digital archive ecosystem. Through systematic examination of stakeholder roles, values, and objectives, the authors create a comprehensive mapping of interests across the platform. The study focuses on understanding how different stakeholder groups interact with the recommender system and what their primary goals and concerns are regarding data quality, accessibility, impact, and visibility.

## Key Results
- Identified six distinct stakeholder groups with varying values and objectives in the Monasterium.net ecosystem
- Mapped potential conflicts between stakeholder interests, particularly around data quality versus accessibility and impact versus preservation
- Established foundational framework for value-aware recommender system design in humanities research contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study works by systematically analyzing the complex ecosystem of a digital archive through stakeholder mapping. By identifying the distinct groups and their respective values, the research reveals how different objectives can create tensions in recommender system design. The mechanism operates through understanding that each stakeholder group has unique goals - from data curators prioritizing quality to researchers seeking accessibility, and from publishers wanting visibility to funding agencies requiring impact metrics. This multi-dimensional analysis allows for the identification of potential conflicts and synergies that can inform more balanced system design.

## Foundational Learning
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Why needed - To understand the complex ecosystem of interests in digital humanities platforms; Quick check - Can you identify at least three distinct stakeholder groups with different objectives?
- **Value Mapping**: Why needed - To visualize and compare competing priorities across stakeholder groups; Quick check - Have you documented the primary value for each identified stakeholder group?
- **Conflict Identification**: Why needed - To anticipate design challenges in multistakeholder systems; Quick check - Can you identify at least one potential conflict between stakeholder values?
- **Recommender System Design**: Why needed - To create systems that balance multiple stakeholder needs; Quick check - Have you considered how different stakeholder values might influence recommendation algorithms?
- **Digital Humanities Context**: Why needed - To understand the specific challenges of cultural heritage data; Quick check - Can you explain how humanities research differs from commercial recommendation scenarios?
- **Multistakeholder Systems**: Why needed - To address the complexity of platforms serving multiple user types; Quick check - Have you mapped the relationships and dependencies between different stakeholder groups?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Stakeholder Groups -> Value Identification -> Conflict Analysis -> Recommender System Design Framework

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from stakeholder identification through value mapping to conflict analysis, culminating in recommendations for system design that can accommodate multiple stakeholder needs while maintaining system effectiveness.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff involves balancing competing stakeholder values - for instance, maximizing data accessibility for researchers may conflict with data quality standards maintained by editors, while platform owners may need to balance impact metrics with preservation requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Key failure modes include: (1) recommender systems that favor one stakeholder group at the expense of others, leading to system abandonment; (2) design paralysis from attempting to satisfy all stakeholder needs simultaneously; (3) oversimplification of stakeholder values that misses important nuances in the humanities research context.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Conduct stakeholder interviews to validate and refine the identified value categories
2. Prototype a value-weighted recommendation algorithm that can adjust based on stakeholder priority settings
3. Test the framework across different digital archive platforms to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several emerge from the research including: How can recommender systems dynamically adjust to changing stakeholder priorities over time? What metrics can effectively measure the success of multistakeholder recommender systems? How can systems maintain transparency about whose values are being prioritized in recommendations?

## Limitations
- Potential generalizability issues beyond the specific context of Monasterium.net
- Possible incomplete capture of all relevant stakeholder perspectives, particularly indirect users
- Lack of empirical evidence showing how identified stakeholder values actually influence real-world recommender system design and outcomes

## Confidence
- High confidence: The identification of distinct stakeholder groups and their basic values/objectives
- Medium confidence: The potential for conflicts between stakeholder values and the implications for recommender system design
- Low confidence: The specific recommendations for balancing stakeholder needs and the effectiveness of value-aware recommender systems

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comparative study across multiple digital archives to assess the generalizability of stakeholder value patterns identified in this research
2. Implement and evaluate prototype recommender systems that explicitly incorporate stakeholder value considerations, measuring their impact on user satisfaction and system performance
3. Perform longitudinal analysis to track how stakeholder values and their relative importance evolve over time in the context of digital humanities research
