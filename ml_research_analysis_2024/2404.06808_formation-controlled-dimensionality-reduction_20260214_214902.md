# Formation-Controlled Dimensionality Reduction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06808
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06808
- Authors: Taeuk Jeong; Yoon Mo Jung; Euntack Lee
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Introduces a nonlinear dynamical system for dimensionality reduction inspired by formation control, achieving competitive performance in trustworthiness and continuity metrics on synthetic and real datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel nonlinear dynamical system for dimensionality reduction inspired by formation control of mobile agents. The method consists of two components: controlling neighbor points to preserve local structures and controlling remote points to maintain global structures. The system iteratively updates a low-dimensional representation by minimizing a potential function that balances local geodesic distance preservation with global distance constraints. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets (Swiss roll, helix, twin peaks, broken Swiss roll) and real datasets (MNIST, COIL20, ORL, HIVA) demonstrate the method's soundness and effectiveness compared to existing dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Method Summary
The proposed method implements a two-term gradient flow dynamical system that iteratively updates low-dimensional embeddings. First, it computes geodesic distances between k-nearest neighbors in the original space and enforces these distances in the embedding through a potential function. Second, it uses a lower bound approximation of geodesic distances between remote points to apply repulsive forces that preserve global structure. The system is solved using forward Euler integration with specified parameters (δ = 10⁻⁷, ∆t = 0.2, η = 10⁻³, λt = 1), and convergence is determined by monitoring maximum distance between consecutive iterations. Data is preprocessed by normalization using sample mean and standard deviation before applying the dynamical system updates.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated competitive performance in generalization errors of 1-nearest neighbor classifiers on MNIST and COIL20 datasets
- Achieved favorable trustworthiness and continuity metrics compared to benchmark methods on synthetic and real datasets
- Successfully preserved both local structures (e.g., spiral patterns in Swiss roll) and global structures (e.g., circular topology in helix) in low-dimensional embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The model preserves local structure by enforcing neighbor point distance constraints via a gradient flow system.
- Mechanism: The dynamical system uses a potential function that penalizes deviations between geodesic distances in the original space and Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding. The gradient flow of this potential iteratively updates point positions to satisfy these constraints.
- Core assumption: The geodesic distance between neighbor points can be approximated by Euclidean distance in the original high-dimensional space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The system consists of two parts; the control of neighbor points, addressing local structures..."
  - [section] "We consider the following objective as a potential for dimensionality reduction: ϕ(y1,...,yn) = 1/2 ∑i=1^n ϕi = 1/2 ∑i=1^n 1/2 ∑j∈Ni ‖dM(xi,xj)p − ‖yi − yj‖p‖q"
- Break condition: If the original data does not lie on or near a manifold, the geodesic distance approximation fails, leading to poor local structure preservation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model preserves global structure by using repulsive forces between remote points to maintain approximate distances.
- Mechanism: The second term in the dynamical system pushes remote points apart until their Euclidean distance in the embedding exceeds a lower bound approximation of the geodesic distance. This term acts as a repulsive force that prevents local structure preservation from distorting global relationships.
- Core assumption: The Euclidean distance in the original space provides a reasonable lower bound for geodesic distances between sufficiently separated points.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...and the control of remote points, accounting for global structures."
  - [section] "To circumvent the insufficiency of the geometry by neighbor points, we add a non-local distance term... For i = 1,...,n and t > 0, dyi/dt = ... + λt ∑j∈Ri [~dM(xi,xj) − ‖yi − yj‖]+ yi − yj/‖yi − yj‖"
- Break condition: If the remote point selection is too sparse or the lower bound approximation is too loose, global structure may not be adequately preserved.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The dynamical system converges to a stable configuration that preserves both local and global structures through gradient descent on the combined potential.
- Mechanism: The Lyapunov function V(e) = 1/2‖e‖² measures the error between desired and actual distances. The time derivative ˙V(e) ≤ 0 indicates that the system is stable and will converge to configurations where the error is minimized.
- Core assumption: The neighbor graph structure allows for realizable configurations where all distance constraints can be satisfied simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Numerical experiments are performed on both synthetic and real datasets and comparisons with existing models demonstrate the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed model."
  - [section] "Using the above relations, we have ˙V(e) = ⟨e, ˙e⟩ = ⟨e, ∂e/∂y ˙y⟩ = −⟨e, RR⊤e⟩ ≤ 0."
- Break condition: If the neighbor graph is not sufficiently connected or has poor topology, the system may get stuck in local minima that don't preserve the true manifold structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Formation control and gradient flow dynamics
  - Why needed here: The paper draws direct inspiration from formation control theory, where agents move to achieve desired relative positions. Understanding gradient flow is essential for grasping how the dynamical system evolves.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the potential function and the gradient flow in a dynamical system?

- Concept: Manifold learning and geodesic distances
  - Why needed here: The model assumes data lies on or near a Riemannian manifold and uses geodesic distances as the gold standard for distance preservation. Understanding this concept is crucial for appreciating the model's objectives.
  - Quick check question: How does the geodesic distance between two points on a manifold differ from their Euclidean distance in the ambient space?

- Concept: Graph theory and rigidity
  - Why needed here: The neighbor relationships form a graph structure, and the paper discusses graph rigidity as a theoretical foundation. Understanding graph connectivity and rigidity helps explain when the model will succeed or fail.
  - Quick check question: What is the minimum number of edges required for a graph to be infinitesimally rigid in 2D space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Distance computation -> Dynamical system update -> Convergence check -> Output embedding
- Critical path: Distance computation → Dynamical system update → Convergence check → Output embedding
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Local vs. global structure: Balancing the weights of neighbor and remote point terms
  - Computational cost: Trade-off between more accurate distance approximations and runtime
  - Parameter sensitivity: k-nearest neighbors, remote point selection, and learning rate
- Failure signatures:
  - Local structure collapse: Points cluster incorrectly due to insufficient neighbor constraints
  - Global structure distortion: Manifold unfolding fails due to inadequate remote point repulsion
  - Numerical instability: Oscillations or divergence in the dynamical system updates
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Swiss roll dataset: Test local structure preservation by checking if the spiral structure is maintained
  2. Helix dataset: Test global structure preservation by verifying the circular topology is preserved
  3. Broken Swiss roll: Test robustness by checking if discontinuities are respected while maintaining overall structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense, but several important limitations and areas for future work are implicit in the discussion:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of neighbor set selection method (k-nearest vs ϵ-neighborhood) impact the quality of the dimensionality reduction, especially in terms of preserving global structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using k-nearest neighbors for kDRFC and symmetrized k-nearest neighbors for sDRFC, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different neighbor selection methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different neighbor selection methods on the quality of dimensionality reduction, particularly in terms of preserving global structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of different neighbor selection methods (e.g., k-nearest, ϵ-neighborhood, adaptive methods) on various datasets, evaluating their impact on global structure preservation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical convergence rate of the proposed dynamical system for dimensionality reduction, and how does it compare to existing methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the lack of exact convergence rate for the reduced model and does not provide a comparison with existing methods in terms of convergence speed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of the proposed method, nor does it compare the convergence speed with existing dimensionality reduction techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of the proposed method, along with empirical comparisons of convergence speed against other dimensionality reduction methods on various datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method scale to very large datasets, and what are the potential bottlenecks in terms of computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the computational cost of one iteration and the number of iterations required for convergence, but does not discuss the scalability of the method to very large datasets or potential bottlenecks in terms of computational efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method to very large datasets or identify potential bottlenecks in terms of computational efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the scalability of the proposed method to very large datasets, including a discussion of potential bottlenecks and possible solutions to improve computational efficiency.

## Limitations

- Theoretical foundation is limited: The paper provides sparse theoretical analysis and doesn't address convergence guarantees or quality of local minima
- Critical dependence on manifold assumption: The method assumes data lies on or near a manifold, which may not hold for many real-world datasets
- Lack of extensive ablation studies: The paper doesn't isolate the contribution of local versus global structure preservation through systematic ablation experiments

## Confidence

- **High**: The formation control framework and gradient flow dynamics are well-established concepts in dynamical systems theory
- **Medium**: The empirical results showing competitive performance on benchmark datasets
- **Low**: The theoretical guarantees about convergence quality and the relationship between local/global structure preservation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the relative importance of neighbor versus remote point constraints by testing variants that use only local or only global structure preservation
2. Test the method on datasets known to violate manifold assumptions (e.g., disjoint clusters with no manifold structure) to identify failure modes
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on key hyperparameters (k for neighbors, remote point selection criteria, learning rate) to understand robustness and provide practical guidance for parameter selection
