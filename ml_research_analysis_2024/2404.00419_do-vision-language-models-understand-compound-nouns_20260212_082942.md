# Do Vision-Language Models Understand Compound Nouns?

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00419

- The paper introduces Compun, a novel benchmark with 400 unique compound nouns to evaluate vision-language models' understanding of compound nouns.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap in evaluating vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to understand compound nouns (CNs) through text-to-image retrieval. The authors introduce Compun, a benchmark containing 400 unique CNs, each represented by one image and two distractor images showing constituent nouns. An analysis reveals that CLIP struggles particularly with attributed CNs where one noun modifies the visual of the other. To improve VLM performance, the authors propose a framework that generates multiple diverse captions using an LLM, where each caption includes the CN as an object in varied scenes. This approach improves CLIP's and OpenCLIP's performance on Compun by 8.25% and 2.35%, respectively.

## Method Summary
The authors first construct Compun, a benchmark of 400 compound nouns with corresponding images. They then evaluate CLIP and other VLMs on this benchmark using template-based prompts ("A photo of a {compound noun}"). To improve performance, they employ GPT-4 to generate 5 diverse captions for each compound noun, where the CN appears as an object in varied scenes. These captions are used to build custom text prompts for retrieval, with the image having the highest mean similarity to all generated prompts selected. The method addresses CLIP's limited understanding of attributed CNs by providing richer contextual information than simple template prompts.

## Key Results
- CLIP achieves 75.25% accuracy on Compun benchmark, revealing limited understanding of certain CN types
- The proposed caption generation method improves CLIP's performance by 8.25% and OpenCLIP's by 2.35%
- CLIP struggles most with attributed compound nouns where one noun acts as an attribute modifying the other

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method improves VLM performance by generating diverse captions that include the compound noun as an object in varied scenes, providing richer contextual information than simple template prompts.
- Mechanism: The LLM generates multiple captions describing the compound noun in diverse settings with different verbs and adjectives. These captions are then used to build custom text prompts for retrieval. The image with the highest mean similarity to all generated prompts is selected.
- Core assumption: Diverse contextual examples help VLMs better understand the semantic relationship between constituent nouns in compound nouns.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "We employ a Large Language Model to generate multiple diverse captions that include the CN as an object in the scene described by the caption. Our proposed method improves CN understanding of CLIP by 8.25% on Compun." [section]: "Our core hypothesis builds on existing work in using language as an internal representation for visual recognition, which creates an interpretable bottleneck for computer vision tasks... Getting exposed to diverse keywords through examples makes the image with the compound noun a strongly activating image while the distractors are lowly activating."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The method addresses CLIP's limited understanding of attributed compound nouns where one noun acts as an attribute to modify the visual of the other.
- Mechanism: By providing diverse examples of the compound noun in different contexts, the method helps the VLM associate the compound noun with its visual representation beyond just recognizing the constituent nouns.
- Core assumption: VLMs struggle with compound nouns where one noun is primarily an attribute, and diverse contextual examples can help overcome this limitation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "We perform an in-depth analysis to highlight CLIPs' limited understanding of certain types of CNs." [section]: "Fig. 3 compares the number of incorrectly predicted instances in Compun across these 3 categories. CLIP makes the highest number of mistakes in the first category, which also indicates CLIPs' limited understanding of such CNs, which can also be interpreted as attributed CNs."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method leverages the power of language models to create an interpretable bottleneck for visual recognition, allowing flexible comparison of visual concepts using natural language.
- Mechanism: Instead of querying the VLM with just the compound noun, the method uses diverse language examples to compare visual concepts flexibly. This enables the VLM to activate strongly for images containing the compound noun while deactivating for distractors.
- Core assumption: Language provides a powerful internal representation for visual recognition tasks, and diverse language examples can guide VLMs to better understand complex visual concepts.
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "Our core hypothesis builds on existing work in using language as an internal representation for visual recognition, which creates an interpretable bottleneck for computer vision tasks... Since interpreting compound nouns is easier when provided with proper context in example sentences, getting exposed to diverse keywords through examples makes the image with the compound noun a strongly activating image while the distractors are lowly activating."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Compound nouns and their interpretation
  - Why needed here: Understanding compound nouns and their semantic relationships is crucial for evaluating and improving VLM performance on the Compun benchmark.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a compound noun where one noun acts as an attribute and one where both nouns are visually distinct?

- Concept: Vision-language models and contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of VLMs, their training objectives, and limitations is essential for understanding the problem statement and the proposed solution.
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning help VLMs learn visual representations from natural language supervision?

- Concept: Text-to-image retrieval and zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The task of selecting the correct image representing a compound noun among distractors requires understanding of text-to-image retrieval and zero-shot learning concepts.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning in the context of text-to-image retrieval?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CLIP/CLIP-like VLM (text and image encoders) -> LLM (for generating diverse captions) -> Compun benchmark (dataset) -> Text-to-image retrieval pipeline

- Critical path: 1. Input compound noun 2. LLM generates diverse captions 3. Build custom prompts using generated captions 4. Compute mean similarity between image and prompts 5. Select image with highest mean similarity

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of diverse captions: More captions may improve performance but increase computational cost
  - Caption diversity: Balancing diversity and relevance of generated captions
  - VLM choice: Different VLMs may have varying performance on the Compun benchmark

- Failure signatures:
  - Low performance on the Compun benchmark
  - LLM generating irrelevant or repetitive captions
  - VLM failing to understand the semantic relationship between constituent nouns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Evaluate performance with different numbers of diverse captions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  2. Qualitative analysis: Visualize and analyze the generated captions and their impact on retrieval performance
  3. Cross-VLM evaluation: Test the method's effectiveness on different VLMs (CLIP, OpenCLIP, ALIGN, ALBEF, BLIP)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do vision-language models perform on compound nouns that are not commonly used or are emerging in nature?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that Compun does not consist of emerging compound nouns like the NYTWIT dataset, which proposed compound nouns where humans created entirely new compound nouns using editing nouns corresponding to entirely new concepts. These compound nouns are particularly challenging for even modern language models to interpret and require strong reasoning abilities over context.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on commonly used compound nouns and does not explore the performance of vision-language models on emerging or less common compound nouns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating vision-language models on a dataset of emerging compound nouns and comparing their performance to that on commonly used compound nouns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are better evaluation metrics and benchmark designs for text-to-image retrieval tasks involving compound nouns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of current evaluation metrics and benchmark designs, stating that results on Compun are superficial and that evaluating Compun with the entire benchmark as negatives makes it difficult to understand where and how vision-language models go wrong in interpreting compound nouns.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the need for better evaluation metrics and benchmark designs but does not provide specific solutions or alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new evaluation metrics and benchmark designs that provide more insight into the performance of vision-language models on compound noun interpretation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do other types of vision-language models, such as auto-regressive models, perform on compound noun interpretation tasks compared to contrastive models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that it evaluates Compun only on contrastive trained vision-language models as it tries to study compound noun interpretation through the lens of text-to-image retrieval, and contrastive models fit well to the retrieval task. However, it also states that as part of future work, it would like to study how well other types of vision-language models, like auto-regressive models, interpret compound nouns.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of other types of vision-language models on compound noun interpretation tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating auto-regressive vision-language models on the Compun benchmark and comparing their performance to contrastive models.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness on VLMs beyond CLIP and OpenCLIP remains untested, despite evaluating five other models in baseline comparisons
- Generating multiple captions for each compound noun introduces additional computational costs that aren't thoroughly analyzed in terms of trade-offs with performance gains
- The method's success heavily relies on GPT-4's ability to generate diverse and relevant captions, which may vary across different compound noun types

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The Compun benchmark construction methodology and baseline VLM performance metrics are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed caption generation method shows consistent improvement across CLIP and OpenCLIP, but results on other VLMs are not reported
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism explanations for why diverse captions improve VLM understanding, while theoretically sound, lack empirical validation through ablation studies or qualitative analysis of caption impact

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-VLM Validation**: Test the caption generation method on all five additional VLMs (ALIGN, ALBEF, BLIP, MetaCLIP) evaluated in the baseline to assess generalizability

2. **Caption Ablation Study**: Systematically evaluate performance using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 captions per compound noun to quantify the relationship between caption quantity and retrieval accuracy

3. **Human Caption Comparison**: Compare GPT-4 generated captions against human-written diverse captions for a subset of compound nouns to assess whether the LLM captures the same semantic nuances humans would provide
