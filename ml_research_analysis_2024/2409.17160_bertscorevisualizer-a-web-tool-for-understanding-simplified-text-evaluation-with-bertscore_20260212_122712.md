# BERTScoreVisualizer: A Web Tool for Understanding Simplified Text Evaluation with BERTScore

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17160
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Web application visualizing token-level matching information from BERTScore for automatic text simplification evaluation

## Executive Summary
BERTScoreVisualizer is a web-based tool designed to enhance the evaluation of automatic text simplification systems by providing token-level visualization of BERTScore matching information. The tool displays how each token in reference text is matched to candidate text tokens and vice versa, using cosine similarity between BERT embeddings. When hovering over a token, matching lines are highlighted and token-specific recall/precision scores are shown in color-coded popups, with unmatched tokens marked in red boxes. This visualization helps identify where simplified text deviates from reference text, revealing information loss or insufficient simplification that sequence-level metrics cannot show.

## Method Summary
The tool uses a Flask backend with BERT inference to generate token embeddings and calculate pairwise cosine similarities between reference and candidate text tokens. It implements the BERTScore algorithm to find best-matching tokens, calculate recall/precision scores, and identify unmatched tokens. The React frontend displays both text sequences, draws matching lines between tokens, shows token-specific scores on hover with color coding, and highlights unmatched tokens in red boxes. The system currently uses the "bert-base-uncased" model but can support different embedding models.

## Key Results
- Provides token-level matching visualization for BERTScore evaluation of text simplification
- Highlights unmatched tokens in red boxes to identify information loss or insufficient simplification
- Shows recall/precision scores on hover with color coding for quality assessment
- Available as open-source on GitHub for accessibility and community use

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BERTScoreVisualizer improves simplification evaluation by revealing token-level matching information that sequence-level metrics cannot show
- Mechanism: The tool visualizes cosine similarity scores between BERT embeddings of reference and candidate tokens, showing exactly which tokens are matched and with what quality, allowing users to identify information loss or insufficient simplification
- Core assumption: Token-level matching information provides more granular insights than aggregate precision/recall/F1 scores
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The specific token matchings can be incredibly useful in generating clause-level insight into the quality of simplified text"
  - [section] "BERTScore also identifies unmatched tokens, which are tokens that are not selected as a best-match by any token in the opposing text sequence, by highlighting them in a red box"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly comparable papers found

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The visualization helps users understand where simplified text deviates from reference text by showing matching relationships
- Mechanism: When hovering over tokens, matching lines are highlighted and token-specific scores are shown, allowing users to trace how meaning is preserved or lost at the token level
- Core assumption: Visual representation of matching relationships makes it easier to understand system behavior than numerical scores alone
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We believe that our software can help improve the analysis of text simplification systems by specifically showing where generated, simplified text deviates from reference text"
  - [section] "for every reference token, it highlights the candidate token that best captures, or recalls, the information present in that reference token"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly comparable papers found

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The tool enables detection of both information loss (unmatched reference tokens) and insufficient simplification (unmatched candidate tokens)
- Mechanism: Unmatched tokens are highlighted in red boxes, providing immediate visual feedback about quality issues that would be difficult to detect from aggregate scores
- Core assumption: Users can interpret unmatched tokens as indicators of specific quality problems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Unmatched reference tokens may signify that the simplified text output lost some of the original meaning. Unmatched candidate tokens may be interpreted as 'extra' tokens that do not contribute to capturing the meaning of the reference text"
  - [abstract] "This matching information can help convey insights into simplified text quality that cannot be conveyed by just the sequence-level metrics of precision, recall, and F1 score"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly comparable papers found

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: BERT embeddings and cosine similarity
  - Why needed here: The tool relies on BERT embeddings to create vector representations of tokens and uses cosine similarity to measure their relationship
  - Quick check question: What mathematical operation is used to measure the similarity between BERT token embeddings in this tool?

- Concept: Reference-based evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how metrics like BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE work is essential to appreciate why token-level matching visualization is valuable
  - Quick check question: How does BERTScore differ from BLEU in terms of what it measures?

- Concept: React frontend development
  - Why needed here: The frontend is built with React, so understanding React components, state management, and event handling is necessary to work on the visualization features
  - Quick check question: In the React implementation, what triggers the highlighting of matching lines when a token is hovered over?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User input (reference/candidate text) → Flask backend → BERT inference → BERTScore matching → JSON response → React visualization
- Critical path: User input (reference/candidate text) → Flask backend → BERT inference → BERTScore calculation → JSON response → React visualization
- Design tradeoffs: React provides versatility and web accessibility vs. potentially heavier client-side processing; Flask containerization enables scalability vs. added deployment complexity
- Failure signatures: No matching lines displayed (BERTScore calculation error); hover interactions not working (frontend React bug); slow response times (BERT inference bottleneck)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with simple identical reference/candidate text to verify matching visualization works correctly
  2. Test with reference text containing a word not present in candidate text to verify unmatched token highlighting
  3. Test with complex sentences containing synonyms to verify BERT embedding matching captures semantic similarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal embedding model beyond BERT that could improve the token-level matching visualization for text simplification evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Currently, we only use the 'bert-base-uncased' model for creating vector embeddings but our system can support different embedding models besides BERT."
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge the system can support different models but do not investigate which models might be superior or compare performance across embedding approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of token-level matching visualizations using different embedding models (e.g., RoBERTa, DistilBERT, or other transformer variants) on the same text simplification datasets, measuring how well each model's visualizations correlate with human judgments of simplification quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do unmatched tokens in BERTScoreVisualizer correlate with specific types of simplification errors (e.g., omission, addition, paraphrasing)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies unmatched tokens and notes they "may signify that the simplified text output lost some of the original meaning" or signal "that the text simplification system did not simplify the text sufficiently."
- Why unresolved: While the authors recognize the potential significance of unmatched tokens, they do not systematically categorize or analyze what types of errors these unmatched tokens represent or how frequently different error types occur.
- What evidence would resolve it: Annotation study where human experts categorize unmatched tokens from text simplification outputs into error types, followed by statistical analysis of the frequency and distribution of different error types across simplification systems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does BERTScoreVisualizer improve the development and tuning of text simplification systems compared to using only sequence-level BERTScore metrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper claims the tool "can help improve the analysis of text simplification systems by specifically showing where generated, simplified text deviates from reference text" but provides no empirical evidence of this improvement.
- Why unresolved: The authors make claims about the tool's utility for system improvement but do not demonstrate through experiments whether developers actually produce better systems using the visualization tool versus traditional metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiment where one group of researchers develops simplification systems using only BERTScore metrics while another group uses BERTScoreVisualizer, measuring differences in final system performance and development efficiency.

## Limitations

- No user study or empirical evaluation demonstrating the visualization tool's effectiveness for end users
- Potential for information overload with longer or more complex sentences
- Does not document how the tool handles common simplification scenarios like synonym replacement or paraphrasing

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The technical implementation of the BERTScoreVisualizer tool is well-specified. The mechanism for calculating BERT embeddings, cosine similarities, and best-matching tokens is clearly described and follows established practices in the field.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that token-level matching visualization provides more granular insights than sequence-level metrics is reasonable given the nature of the problem, but lacks empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that this specific tool will "help improve the analysis of text simplification systems" is aspirational rather than evidence-based. No user studies, expert evaluations, or comparative analyses are provided to support this claim.

## Next Checks

1. **User Study Validation**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing human evaluators' ability to identify quality issues in simplified text when using the visualization tool versus using only sequence-level BERTScore metrics. Measure both accuracy and time to complete evaluations.

2. **Visualization Scalability Testing**: Test the tool with progressively longer and more complex sentences (100+ tokens) to identify at what point the visualization becomes cluttered or confusing. Document the practical limits and explore potential solutions like filtering or aggregation for longer texts.

3. **Edge Case Analysis**: Systematically test the tool on common simplification transformations (synonym replacement, sentence splitting, paraphrasing) to document how BERT embedding matching behaves in these scenarios and whether the visualizations remain meaningful and interpretable.
