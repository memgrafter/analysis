core_contribution: This paper demonstrates that BERT language models encode implicit
  depth biases for objects, which can be extracted using a simple learned approach
  and incorporated into monocular depth estimation (MDE) systems. The method uses

# Language-Based Depth Hints for Monocular Depth Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15551
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BERT language models encode implicit depth biases for objects, which can be extracted using a simple learned approach and incorporated into monocular depth estimation systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages BERT language models to extract depth information from object labels and incorporate it into monocular depth estimation systems. The method uses off-the-shelf instance segmentation to identify objects, applies BERT embeddings to their labels, and trains a small network to predict per-object depth distributions. These depth hints are then concatenated with RGB input to improve depth estimation performance on the NYUD2 dataset. The approach achieves better performance than baseline methods across multiple metrics while remaining simple and adaptable to different architectures.

## Method Summary
The approach begins with instance segmentation to identify objects in images, providing object labels that are then passed through BERT to generate embeddings. A small feed-forward network learns to map these BERT embeddings to per-object depth distributions. During inference, these depth hints are concatenated with RGB input and fed into an AdaBins-B1 monocular depth estimation model. The system is trained on the NYUD2 dataset, where ground truth depth information is available. The key innovation is extracting implicit depth biases encoded in language models and using them as supplementary information for depth estimation.

## Key Results
- Achieves improved performance on NYUD2 dataset compared to baseline AdaBins-B1 (Abs Rel: 0.115 vs 0.123 baseline)
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, and δ thresholds
- Shows the approach is adaptable to different language embeddings beyond BERT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the implicit knowledge about object sizes and typical distances encoded in pre-trained language models like BERT. When objects are segmented and labeled in an image, their names carry semantic information about their typical scale and likely depth in a scene. BERT embeddings capture this semantic information, and a learned mapping converts these embeddings into depth distributions for each object. By concatenating these depth hints with RGB input, the monocular depth estimation model receives supplementary information about likely object depths, improving its predictions. This approach effectively injects prior knowledge about object scales into the depth estimation process without requiring explicit geometric reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Instance Segmentation**: Needed to identify and label individual objects in images; Quick check: Verify segmentation accuracy on sample images
- **BERT Embeddings**: Required to extract semantic information from object labels; Quick check: Compare embeddings for different object classes
- **Per-object Depth Distributions**: Necessary to represent uncertainty in depth predictions for each object; Quick check: Visualize depth distributions for various objects
- **AdaBins Architecture**: Provides the base monocular depth estimation framework; Quick check: Understand how AdaBins processes input features
- **Concatenation of Features**: Combines language-derived hints with visual features; Quick check: Verify feature dimensions match for concatenation
- **Dataset Alignment**: Ensures labeled objects match depth annotations; Quick check: Confirm object-label to depth mapping is accurate

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Image -> Instance Segmentation -> Object Labels -> BERT Embeddings -> Feed-forward Network -> Depth Hints -> Concatenation with RGB -> AdaBins-B1 -> Depth Map

**Critical Path**
Object detection/segmentation → BERT embedding generation → Depth hint learning → Feature concatenation → Depth estimation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Using pre-trained BERT vs training from scratch (accuracy vs. computational cost)
- Simple feed-forward network vs. more complex architectures (simplicity vs. potential performance gains)
- Limited dataset (NYUD2) vs. larger datasets (data availability vs. computational requirements)

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor segmentation leading to incorrect object labels
- BERT embeddings failing to capture depth-relevant information for certain objects
- Mismatch between learned depth distributions and actual scene geometry
- Concatenation causing information bottleneck or feature interference

**3 First Experiments**
1. Validate instance segmentation accuracy on NYUD2 test images
2. Compare depth hint predictions against ground truth for individual objects
3. Measure performance impact of removing depth hints from the pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends on accurate instance segmentation, with errors propagating to depth hints
- Limited evaluation primarily on NYUD2 dataset may not generalize to diverse scenes
- Simple feed-forward network may not capture complex language-to-depth relationships
- Claims about adaptability to arbitrary MDE architectures require further validation

## Confidence
- High: Feasibility of extracting depth-related information from BERT embeddings for specific object classes
- Medium: Overall performance improvement over baselines given limited evaluation scope
- Low: Claims about adaptability to arbitrary MDE architectures without extensive validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on diverse datasets beyond NYUD2, including outdoor scenes and other domains, to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the impact of varying instance segmentation quality on the final depth estimation performance to understand robustness to segmentation errors
3. Implement the depth hint approach with multiple MDE architectures beyond AdaBins-B1 to verify claimed adaptability across different models
