# Multi-Dimensional Optimization for Text Summarization via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00303
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00303
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Proposed MDO_min and MDO_pro strategies improve balance across four dimensions (coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance) in text summarization using reinforcement learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two multi-dimensional optimization (MDO) strategies for reinforcement learning in text summarization. The methods, MDO_min and MDO_pro, use adaptive learning by either selecting the lowest dimension score or resolving conflicting gradients via gradient projection. Unlike prior ROUGE-based rewards, the approach uses a QA-based reward model and explores summary length control via discount factor adjustment. Experiments on CNN/DM and BillSum datasets show substantial gains in previously overlooked dimensions, with coverage around 90% and shorter average lengths, while maintaining competitiveness in other dimensions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two MDO strategies for text summarization using reinforcement learning. MDO_min selects the lowest UniEval dimension score as the reward signal at each iteration, forcing the model to focus on the weakest dimension. MDO_pro uses PCGrad to project conflicting gradients across dimensions, maintaining Pareto improvements. Both methods use PPO with KL-penalty, and the discount factor is tuned to control summary length. The approach is evaluated on CNN/DM and BillSum datasets using BART and T5 models.

## Key Results
- MDO strategies achieve balanced improvements across all four dimensions (coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance)
- Coverage reaches approximately 90% with shorter average summary lengths
- MDO_min and MDO_pro outperform traditional ROUGE-based rewards on multi-dimensional metrics
- The discount factor effectively controls summary length by emphasizing future rewards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
MDO_min improves the lowest-performing dimension by directly selecting it as the reward signal during each training iteration. At each iteration, the four UniEval scores are computed, and the lowest score is chosen as the reward. This adaptive selection forces the policy to focus gradient updates on the weakest dimension, balancing performance across all four dimensions.

### Mechanism 2
MDO_pro resolves conflicting gradients across multiple dimensions using PCGrad to project gradients onto a common space, enabling balanced multi-objective learning. Each dimension's gradient is projected onto the normal plane of gradients from other conflicting dimensions. This prevents one dimension's improvement from harming another, maintaining a Pareto improvement across all dimensions.

### Mechanism 3
Adjusting the discount factor in GAE controls the length of generated summaries by influencing how much future rewards are weighted during training. A larger discount factor places more emphasis on future rewards. Since the reward for the final token is determined by UniEval (where relevance is often lowest), a higher discount factor pushes the model to generate shorter summaries that prioritize relevance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Reinforcement learning with multiple rewards (multi-objective RL)
  - **Why needed here:** Text summarization quality depends on multiple dimensions (coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance), so a single reward (like ROUGE) is insufficient.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens if you train with only a single reward in a multi-dimensional evaluation setting?

- **Concept:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and advantage estimation (GAE)
  - **Why needed here:** PPO stabilizes policy updates in text generation tasks, and GAE allows tuning the influence of future rewards via the discount factor.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the discount factor in GAE affect the trade-off between immediate and future rewards?

- **Concept:** Gradient projection for multi-task learning (PCGrad)
  - **Why needed here:** Conflicting gradients between dimensions can stall learning; PCGrad resolves this by projecting gradients onto a common plane.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might directly summing gradients from multiple dimensions be problematic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input document → Encoder-decoder model (BART/T5) → Summary generation → UniEval evaluator → Reward computation → PPO update (policy + value network)
- **Critical path:** 1. Generate summary using current policy. 2. Evaluate all four UniEval dimensions. 3. Compute reward (MDO_min: minimum score; MDO_pro: all scores with PCGrad). 4. Estimate advantage using GAE. 5. Update policy and value networks.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Using UniEval as reward aligns with human preferences but adds evaluation overhead. MDO_min is simpler but may neglect balanced improvement if one dimension dominates. MDO_pro handles conflicts but increases computational cost due to gradient projection.
- **Failure signatures:** Training diverges: KL penalty may be too low or reward scale mismatched. One dimension dominates: Minimum score selection fails to balance. Gradients conflict but PCGrad doesn't resolve: Improper base optimizer choice (Adam vs SGD).
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Compare MDO_min vs MDO_pro on a small dataset to see which better balances all dimensions. 2. Sweep the discount factor to observe its effect on summary length and dimension scores. 3. Replace UniEval with a naive sum of dimension scores to confirm the need for adaptive optimization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific aspects of the UniEval metric make it more robust to reference summary quality compared to ROUGE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that UniEval "closely aligns with human preferences" and addresses shortcomings of ROUGE-based rewards that "fail to evaluate summaries adequately due to poor quality of reference summaries."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions UniEval's advantages but does not provide detailed technical analysis of how its QA-based approach makes it more robust to reference summary quality issues.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis showing UniEval's performance stability across datasets with varying reference summary quality, or detailed explanation of UniEval's design features that make it less dependent on reference summary quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the MDO approach scale to more than four dimensions, and what are the computational implications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on four dimensions but mentions that "the choice of the base optimizer for PCGrad leads to performance differences," suggesting potential scalability issues.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of MDO with more than four dimensions or discuss computational complexity as the number of dimensions increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing MDO performance with varying numbers of dimensions, or analysis of computational complexity as a function of the number of dimensions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the discount factor and the model's tendency to generate shorter summaries, and how can this be controlled?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "a larger discount factor results in shorter summaries" and discusses how this relates to the model's focus on the relevance dimension.
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes this relationship, it does not provide a detailed explanation of the underlying mechanism or methods to control summary length independently of the discount factor.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of how the discount factor affects the model's policy gradients, or experimental results showing how to achieve desired summary lengths through other means besides adjusting the discount factor.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of using the minimum UniEval score as reward relies on the assumption that the UniEval model evaluates all dimensions consistently
- The PCGrad-based approach assumes conflicting gradients between dimensions without empirical evidence for their prevalence in summarization tasks
- The mechanism by which discount factor controls summary length lacks direct corpus evidence and may not generalize beyond the specific reward structure used

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The experimental setup and methodology for comparing MDO strategies are clearly specified and reproducible. The claim that MDO strategies achieve balanced improvements across multiple dimensions is well-supported by the reported results on both CNN/DM and BillSum datasets.

- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical mechanisms of MDO_min (minimum score selection) and MDO_pro (PCGrad for gradient projection) are sound based on established RL literature, but their specific effectiveness for text summarization requires further validation. The relationship between discount factor and summary length is plausible but not robustly established.

- **Low Confidence:** The assumption that UniEval scores are perfectly reliable and consistent across all dimensions without requiring normalization or calibration. The claim that conflicting gradients are a significant problem requiring PCGrad intervention in summarization tasks.

## Next Checks

1. **Dimension Consistency Validation:** Conduct an ablation study where the minimum UniEval score is replaced with an equally weighted sum of all four dimensions. Compare the resulting dimension scores to determine whether the adaptive minimum selection in MDO_min provides measurable benefits over simple averaging.

2. **Gradient Conflict Analysis:** Measure the cosine similarity between gradients from different dimensions across multiple training iterations. Quantify the frequency and magnitude of conflicting gradients to empirically verify whether PCGrad's gradient projection provides meaningful improvements or if the problem is overstated.

3. **Discount Factor Sweep with Controlled Rewards:** Systematically vary the discount factor (γ) while monitoring both summary length and individual dimension scores. Additionally, artificially manipulate the reward structure to test whether the length control mechanism depends specifically on relevance being the lowest-scoring dimension or generalizes to other reward configurations.
