# Scaling Sign Language Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11855
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Large-scale pretraining on noisy multilingual SLT data, parallel text corpora, and MT-augmented data enables zero-shot SLT for unseen language pairs and achieves new SOTA across five benchmarks covering five sign languages

## Executive Summary
This paper explores scaling up sign language translation (SLT) by pretraining large models on diverse data sources, including noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data, parallel text corpora, and augmented SLT data via machine translation. The approach uses an encoder-decoder architecture with task-specific prompts, leveraging pretrained (m/By)T5 models across sizes. Results demonstrate that scaling SLT data, adding MT data, and using larger models (when capacity is a bottleneck) improve performance. The method enables zero-shot SLT for unseen language pairs and achieves new state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks covering five sign languages. The study highlights the significance of data/model scaling and cross-lingual cross-modal transfer in advancing SLT.

## Method Summary
The approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture using (m/By)T5 models that are pretrained on three tasks: sign language translation (SLT), cross-modal alignment, and machine translation (MT). The pretraining uses simplified landmarks from sign language videos as input, along with task-specific prompts to control the translation direction. The pretraining data includes noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data, parallel text corpora (MADLAD-400), and augmented SLT data created by translating video captions to other languages using MT models. After pretraining, models are finetuned on downstream benchmarks including How2Sign, Elementary23, WMT23, and FLEURS-ASL#0.

## Key Results
- Scaling SLT data from YT-ASL to YT-Full improves translation quality with gains up to 11 BLEURT on FLEURS-ASL#0 (En) for ByT5 XL
- Adding MT data enables zero-shot SLT for unseen language pairs and substantially improves translation quality
- Using larger models (Base → XL) benefits SLT when modeling capacity becomes a bottleneck, particularly with more languages and data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Scaling pretraining data (both SLT and MT) improves SLT performance by increasing model exposure to diverse sign language variations and translation patterns
- Mechanism: Large-scale pretraining on diverse, weakly-labeled SLT data from YouTube captures general SLT knowledge despite lower data quality, while adding MT data enables cross-modal transfer and zero-shot capabilities
- Core assumption: The pretraining can extract useful translation knowledge from noisy, weakly-labeled data and cross-task MT data despite the video-text modality gap
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Results show that scaling SLT data, adding MT data, and using larger models (when capacity is a bottleneck) improve performance." [section] "Adding more SLT data, i.e. from YT-ASL to YT-Full, largely improves the translation quality in most settings... Adding more (multilingual) SLT data helps reduce the modality gap... and enable cross-lingual knowledge transfer"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using larger models is beneficial for SLT when modeling capacity becomes a bottleneck, particularly with more languages and data
- Mechanism: Larger models provide increased capacity to handle more translation directions and data complexity, enabling better cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge integration
- Core assumption: Model capacity is the limiting factor when scaling languages and data, and larger models can effectively utilize this increased capacity
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Results show that scaling SLT data, adding MT data, and using larger models (when capacity is a bottleneck) improve performance." [section] "Using larger models is not always helpful: ByT5 Base (582M) often outperforms XL (3.74B), but model scaling does benefit SLT when modeling capacity becomes a bottleneck (e.g., when more languages and data are used)."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentation through MT-based translation of video captions significantly improves multilingual SLT performance
- Mechanism: Augmenting SLT data by translating target captions to other languages with off-the-shelf MT models expands the translation directions available for training, enabling better multilingual SLT capabilities
- Core assumption: The quality of the augmented data is sufficient for pretraining purposes, and the MT models can generate meaningful translations for sign language captions
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Results show that scaling SLT data, adding MT data, and using larger models (when capacity is a bottleneck) improve performance." [section] "We construct synthetic multiway SLT data by translating video captions with an off-the-shelf MT model... We investigate different ways of mixing these data to exploit weakly supervised SLT knowledge as well as cross-task cross-modality transfer at scale."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal representation learning
  - Why needed here: SLT requires bridging the gap between video (spatial-temporal sign language) and text (spoken language) modalities
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a model might learn to map sign language video features to text representations without explicit alignment?

- Concept: Multilingual transfer learning
  - Why needed here: The model needs to leverage knowledge from high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource sign languages
  - Quick check question: How does training on multiple languages simultaneously help improve performance on individual languages?

- Concept: Data augmentation and pseudo-labeling
  - Why needed here: The approach uses MT to generate synthetic training data, requiring understanding of when and how synthetic data can be beneficial
  - Quick check question: What are the risks and benefits of using machine-generated translations as training data for another translation task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sign language video frames (landmark representations) → Encoder ((m/By)T5 model) → Cross-modal understanding → Decoder (generates target spoken language text)
- Critical path: Video frames → Encoder → Cross-modal understanding → Decoder → Text output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Landmark-based vs. raw video input (anonymization vs. information loss)
  - Multi-task vs. single-task training (generalization vs. specialization)
  - Model size scaling (capacity vs. optimization difficulty)
  - Data quality vs. quantity (noisy web data vs. curated datasets)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor cross-lingual transfer despite MT training
  - Degraded performance on individual languages in multilingual settings
  - Optimization difficulties with larger models
  - Data leakage or quality issues in augmented data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Base vs. XL model performance on a single language pair to establish scaling effects
  2. Test zero-shot translation capability by training on ASL→English + English→X and evaluating on ASL→X
  3. Evaluate the impact of data augmentation by comparing models trained with and without MT-augmented data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does scaling the amount of multilingual sign language translation (SLT) data improve performance more than scaling the number of languages in the SLT data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that scaling SLT data from YT-ASL to YT-Full generally improves quality significantly, with gains reaching up to 11 BLEURT on FLEURS-ASL#0 (En) for ByT5 XL. However, it also mentions that scaling the number of languages to 80 during pretraining, while beneficial, lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluation.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the benefits of scaling SLT data, it does not directly compare the impact of increasing the amount of data versus increasing the number of languages. The evaluation is limited to a subset of languages, and the overall impact on performance across all 80 languages is unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that isolate the effects of increasing the amount of SLT data versus increasing the number of languages, while controlling for other variables, would provide a clearer understanding of which factor has a greater impact on performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the use of augmented SLT data via machine translation compare to using high-quality human-translated data in terms of performance and scalability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores augmenting SLT data by translating video captions to other languages with off-the-shelf MT models, showing substantial improvements in translation quality. However, it does not compare this approach to using human-translated data.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of augmented SLT data but does not provide a direct comparison with human-translated data. The trade-offs between scalability, cost, and quality are not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that compare the performance of models trained on augmented SLT data versus those trained on high-quality human-translated data, while considering factors such as scalability and cost, would provide insights into the optimal approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different types of sign language representations (e.g., landmarks, glosses, or raw video) on the performance of SLT models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses simplified landmarks as a form of anonymization and privacy protection, but it does not explore the impact of using different representations of sign language data on model performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using landmarks, it does not compare this approach to other representations such as glosses or raw video. The potential benefits or drawbacks of each representation are not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that compare the performance of SLT models using different sign language representations, while controlling for other variables, would provide insights into the optimal representation for improving model performance.

## Limitations

- Data Quality and Coverage: The approach relies heavily on noisy YouTube data and MT-augmented corpora, with uncertain quality for low-resource sign languages
- Optimization Challenges: Base models often outperform XL models, suggesting significant optimization difficulties with larger models that aren't fully explored
- Generalization Beyond Benchmarks: While achieving SOTA on five benchmarks, it's unclear how well results generalize to real-world sign language usage across all 80 pretraining languages

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (Evidence strongly supports):
- Scaling SLT data improves performance across most settings
- Adding MT data enables zero-shot SLT for unseen language pairs
- Landmark-based preprocessing enables privacy preservation without catastrophic performance loss

**Medium Confidence** (Evidence supports but with notable caveats):
- Model scaling benefits SLT when capacity is a bottleneck
- Cross-lingual cross-modal transfer is effective for SLT
- Data augmentation through MT significantly improves multilingual SLT

**Low Confidence** (Evidence is limited or indirect):
- The pretraining can extract meaningful translation knowledge from noisy YouTube data
- The modality gap between sign language video and spoken language text can be fully bridged through scaling
- The current architecture is optimal for SLT or cannot be substantially improved

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness Analysis**: Test model performance on sign language data from different sources (not just YouTube) and with varying recording quality to assess real-world robustness beyond curated benchmarks

2. **Cross-Modal Alignment Study**: Conduct ablation studies to quantify exactly how much performance is gained from cross-modal vs. cross-lingual knowledge transfer, and whether the video component adds value beyond text-only pretraining

3. **Optimization Protocol Comparison**: Systematically compare different optimization strategies (learning rate schedules, initialization methods, mixed precision training) for larger models to determine if Base vs. XL performance gaps are due to optimization rather than fundamental capacity limitations
