# AI-as-exploration: Navigating intelligence space
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.07964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07964
- Authors: Dimitri Coelho Mollo

- Primary result: AI can explore intelligence space by revealing diverse computational strategies underlying intelligent behavior

## Executive Summary
This paper argues for AI-as-exploration as a neglected scientific role, where AI systems help investigate the abstract domain of possible intelligent systems. The author proposes that AI can reveal diverse computational and representational mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior, challenging anthropocentric views of intelligence. Using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a case study, the paper demonstrates that AI can achieve human-level performance on cognitive tasks while potentially employing fundamentally different strategies, such as statistical pattern recognition rather than rule-based reasoning.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a conceptual analysis approach, examining existing literature on LLM performance in cognitive benchmarks. The primary case study focuses on Conceptual Combinations tasks, where LLMs achieve human-level accuracy despite likely using different underlying mechanisms than humans. The analysis compares LLM performance patterns with human cognitive strategies to infer differences in computational approaches. The paper synthesizes findings from multiple sources to support the broader claim about AI's role in exploring intelligence space.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve human-level accuracy on Conceptual Combinations benchmark tasks
- LLMs likely solve tasks using statistical patterns rather than human-like rule-based reasoning
- AI-as-exploration can reveal alternative, equally effective approaches to cognitive tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper posits that intelligence emerges from computational and representational mechanisms rather than specific implementations. By creating artificial systems that achieve similar behavioral outcomes through different mechanisms, AI can reveal the diversity of possible approaches to intelligence. The mechanism relies on comparing behavioral outputs while inferring underlying computational strategies, allowing researchers to map the space of possible intelligent systems beyond human-centric approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Intelligence space concept: Understanding the abstract domain of possible intelligent systems
  * Why needed: Provides theoretical framework for comparing different approaches to intelligence
  * Quick check: Can define boundaries and dimensions of intelligence space
- Computational mechanisms: The underlying processes that produce intelligent behavior
  * Why needed: Distinguishes between behavioral outcomes and implementation strategies
  * Quick check: Can identify specific algorithms or patterns used by different systems
- Representational strategies: How information is encoded and manipulated
  * Why needed: Reveals fundamental differences in cognitive architecture
  * Quick check: Can characterize the type of representations used (symbolic, statistical, etc.)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: AI system -> Behavioral benchmark -> Mechanism inference -> Intelligence space mapping
Critical path: System design → Performance measurement → Strategy analysis → Space characterization
Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. interpretability, computational efficiency vs. cognitive plausibility
Failure signatures: Overfitting to benchmarks, anthropomorphizing AI behavior, conflating performance with understanding
First experiments: 1) Benchmark diverse AI architectures on same tasks 2) Analyze failure patterns across systems 3) Map behavioral similarities to computational differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input

## Limitations
- Intelligence space concept remains largely theoretical without concrete mathematical frameworks
- Single benchmark case study may not represent broader claims about AI's role
- Limited systematic comparison across multiple AI approaches beyond LLMs
- Difficulty distinguishing novel cognitive strategies from implementation artifacts

## Confidence
High confidence: LLMs achieve human-level performance on Conceptual Combinations using different strategies
Medium confidence: AI can reveal alternative approaches to intelligence (based on single case study)
Low confidence: AI-as-exploration will fundamentally reshape understanding of intelligence

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark multiple AI architectures on diverse cognitive tasks to identify genuine novel strategies
2. Develop formal mathematical frameworks for characterizing and measuring intelligence space
3. Design controlled experiments comparing human and AI performance with varying expertise levels
