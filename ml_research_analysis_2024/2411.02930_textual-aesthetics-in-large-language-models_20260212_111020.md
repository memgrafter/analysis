# Textual Aesthetics in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.02930
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02930
- Authors: Lingjie Jiang; Shaohan Huang; Xun Wu; Furu Wei
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLaMA-3.1-70B-TAPO shows 18.88% improvement in text-based aesthetic scores and 27.85% enhancement in image-based scores compared to LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the overlooked aspect of textual aesthetics in large language models by introducing a novel pipeline for aesthetics polishing and a corresponding fine-tuning method. The authors construct TEXAES, a dataset containing 50,390 prompts and responses with aesthetic improvements, and develop TAPO, a preference optimization method that leverages this dataset to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM outputs. Their approach demonstrates significant improvements in both aesthetic quality and general performance on benchmarks like AlpacaEval and Arena-hard, showing that aesthetic enhancement doesn't necessarily compromise content correctness.

## Method Summary
The method introduces TAPO (Textual Aesthetics Preference Optimization), a fine-tuning approach that uses the Plackett-Luce ranking model to optimize for both aesthetic preferences and human preferences simultaneously. The TEXAES dataset is constructed by polishing UltraFeedback data using GPT-4o, with responses filtered by length constraints to maintain naturalness. The dual evaluation system employs both text-based scoring using pairwise comparison and image-based scoring by rendering text as HTML for visual assessment. The TAPO framework balances two objectives - LTA for aesthetic preference and LDPO for human preference - using adjustable weights during optimization.

## Key Results
- LLaMA-3.1-70B-TAPO achieves 18.88% improvement in text-based aesthetic scores over LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct
- 27.85% enhancement in image-based aesthetic scores with the same model
- Improved performance on general benchmarks including AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-hard while enhancing aesthetic quality
- Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple model scales (8B and 70B parameter models)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Plackett-Luce model enables effective ranking-based preference optimization by jointly optimizing over three response types (yt, yw, yl).
- Mechanism: TAPO uses the Plackett-Luce ranking model to assign relative preferences among the three response types. The loss decomposes into LTA (optimizing for aesthetic preference) and LDPO (optimizing for human preference), with adjustable weights to balance both objectives.
- Core assumption: The three response types can be meaningfully ranked in a single optimization framework without conflicting gradients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a textual aesthetics-powered fine-tuning method based on direct preference optimization, termed TAPO, which leverages textual aesthetics without compromising content correctness."
  - [section 4.2]: "We adopt the Plackett-Luce (Luce, 1959; Plackett, 1975) model as the underlying preference model."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations to Plackett-Luce in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If LTA and LDPO gradients conflict significantly, the weighted sum could lead to suboptimal optimization in both dimensions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Length-constrained aesthetic polishing prevents generation of overly verbose responses while maintaining natural human-like quality.
- Mechanism: During TEXAES construction, responses exceeding the 90% confidence interval of length differences are filtered out, ensuring aesthetic polishing doesn't compromise response naturalness.
- Core assumption: Length filtering effectively removes unnatural verbose outputs while preserving high-quality aesthetic improvements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "To address this issue, we implemented a length constraint for the polishing process."
  - [section 5.1]: "we excluded outliers in the distribution of length differences before and after aesthetic polishing, retaining only data within the 90% confidence interval."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations to length-based filtering techniques in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If the length constraint threshold is too restrictive, it may remove genuinely useful longer responses that maintain aesthetic quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using GPT-4o as an evaluator for both text-based and image-based aesthetic scoring provides reliable proxy measurements for human preferences.
- Mechanism: Two evaluation methods are developed - text-based scoring using pairwise comparison with Bradley-Terry model, and image-based scoring by rendering text as HTML and evaluating visual appeal through GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities.
- Core assumption: GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities and judgment quality approximate human aesthetic preferences for both textual and visual dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "we employ the 'LLM as a judge' framework to approximate human preferences for text aesthetics."
  - [section 6.5]: "These results suggest that our GPT-4o judges can serve as effective proxies for human preferences in assessing text aesthetics."
  - [corpus]: Moderate - "Can MLLMs generate human-like feedback in grading multimodal short answers?" explores similar LLM-as-judge concepts.
- Break condition: If GPT-4o's evaluation criteria systematically differ from human judgment, the proxy measurements become unreliable for optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Preference optimization and ranking models
  - Why needed here: TAPO extends DPO by incorporating a three-way ranking system using Plackett-Luce, requiring understanding of preference learning fundamentals
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between Bradley-Terry and Plackett-Luce models in preference optimization?

- Concept: Text aesthetics evaluation criteria
  - Why needed here: The paper defines aesthetics across readability, visual organization, consistency, and coherence - understanding these dimensions is crucial for working with TEXAES
  - Quick check question: How would you differentiate between visual organization and consistency in text aesthetics?

- Concept: Multimodal evaluation techniques
  - Why needed here: The image-based scoring method requires converting text to visual representations and evaluating them through multimodal models
  - Quick check question: What are the potential advantages and limitations of evaluating text aesthetics through rendered images rather than raw text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TEXAES dataset construction → TAPO training framework → Dual evaluation system → Model comparison infrastructure
- Critical path: Dataset → TAPO fine-tuning → Evaluation → Model selection
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Length filtering vs. preserving natural responses
  - Weight tuning between LTA and LDPO objectives
  - Text vs. image evaluation for comprehensive assessment
- Failure signatures:
  - Model performance degrades on general benchmarks while improving aesthetic scores
  - Length-filtered data produces overly terse responses
  - Image-based evaluation shows high variance compared to text-based scoring
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run TAPO with wTA:wDPO ratios of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 on a small model to observe trade-off effects
  2. Compare model outputs with and without length filtering to validate naturalness preservation
  3. Test evaluation consistency by having GPT-4o score the same responses multiple times to measure variance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal weight ratio between LTA and LDPO in the TAPO method for maximizing both textual aesthetics and general capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper experiments with different weight ratios (2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5) and observes their effects on aesthetic scores and general performance metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited set of weight ratios and does not explore the full range of possible ratios or their interactions with different model sizes and types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive grid search over a wider range of weight ratios, combined with ablation studies on different model architectures and scales, would provide a clearer understanding of the optimal balance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the TEXAES dataset perform compared to human-generated aesthetic preferences in fine-tuning LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper constructs TEXAES using GPT-4o for aesthetic polishing and evaluates its effectiveness against UltraFeedback, but does not directly compare it to human-generated aesthetic data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include a direct comparison with human-generated aesthetic preferences, which would provide a gold standard for evaluating the quality of TEXAES.
- What evidence would resolve it: A side-by-side comparison of models fine-tuned on TEXAES versus models fine-tuned on a dataset of human-generated aesthetic preferences, evaluated on the same metrics, would clarify the relative performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of length constraints on the quality of TEXAES and the performance of models fine-tuned with TAPO?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions implementing a length constraint to address verbosity issues in polished responses and conducts an ablation study showing its effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests one specific length constraint and does not explore the effects of different length constraints or their interactions with other factors such as model size or dataset composition.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying length constraints and analyzing their effects on model performance across different scales and tasks would provide insights into the optimal length constraints for TEXAES and TAPO.

## Limitations
- The paper's reliance on GPT-4o as both the aesthetic polisher and evaluator introduces a significant single-point-of-failure risk.
- TEXAES dataset construction involves filtering based on length differences within the 90% confidence interval, but the paper does not specify how this threshold was determined.
- The TAPO optimization framework uses adjustable weights between LTA and LDPO objectives, but the paper does not explore the full parameter space.

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the fundamental approach: The integration of preference optimization with aesthetic quality objectives is technically sound, and the use of Plackett-Luce for ranking-based optimization is well-established in the literature.

**Medium confidence** in the empirical results: While the reported improvements on aesthetic scores and general benchmarks are substantial, the validation relies heavily on LLM-based evaluation.

**Low confidence** in the generalizability: The TEXAES dataset is constructed from UltraFeedback, which may have inherent biases, and the paper does not analyze dataset diversity across different domains.

## Next Checks

1. **Human validation study**: Conduct blind human evaluations comparing LLaMA-3.1-70B-TAPO outputs against baseline models on the same prompts used in the paper's aesthetic scoring.

2. **Weight ratio sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the wTA:wDPO ratios across a wider range and evaluate the resulting models on both aesthetic scores and general benchmark performance.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply the fine-tuned models to generate responses on prompts from different sources and evaluate whether aesthetic improvements transfer across domains.
