# Less is More: Fewer Interpretable Region via Submodular Subset Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09164
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09164

- Key outcome: Image attribution reformulated as submodular subset selection, achieving significant improvements in interpretability scores for both correctly and incorrectly predicted samples.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving model interpretability in image attribution by reformulating it as a submodular subset selection problem. The method focuses on selecting a fixed number of interpretable sub-regions rather than attributing importance to individual pixels, which can lead to more meaningful explanations. By incorporating four different constraints - confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores - the approach ensures that selected regions are both semantically meaningful and collectively impactful. Experiments on face and fine-grained datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in explaining incorrect predictions and achieving higher interpretability with fewer regions.

## Method Summary
The method reformulates image attribution as a submodular subset selection problem, where the goal is to select a fixed number of sub-regions that maximize a submodular function. Images are first divided into sub-regions guided by prior saliency maps, and then a greedy search algorithm is used to select the most important sub-regions based on a combination of confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores. The confidence score is derived from evidential deep learning to ensure selected regions are in-distribution, while the other scores evaluate the semantic meaning, consistency with targets, and collective impact of the regions. This approach aims to improve interpretability by focusing on local, semantically meaningful regions rather than global pixel importance.

## Key Results
- Achieved average gains of 4.9% and 2.5% in Deletion and Insertion scores for correctly predicted samples
- Demonstrated 81.0% and 18.4% improvements in average highest confidence and Insertion scores for incorrectly predicted samples
- Showed superior performance in identifying reasons behind model prediction errors with fewer fine-grained regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Submodular subset selection enables better attribution by focusing on local, interpretable regions rather than global pixel importance.
- Mechanism: The method reformulates image attribution as selecting a fixed number of sub-regions that maximize a submodular function, which evaluates interpretability through confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores.
- Core assumption: Local regions can achieve better interpretability than global pixel-level attributions, and fewer but more meaningful regions improve model transparency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This paper re-models the above image attribution problem as a submodular subset selection problem, aiming to enhance model interpretability using fewer regions."
  - [section 4.2]: "We construct our objective function for selecting elements through a combination of the above scores, F (S), as follows: F (S) = λ1sconf. + λ2seff. (S) + λ3scons. (S, fs) + λ4scolla. (S, I, fs)"
  - [corpus]: Weak. Related papers focus on efficiency and robustness but not on local interpretability via submodular selection.
- Break condition: If the submodular function fails to be monotonically non-decreasing or submodular, the greedy algorithm's approximation guarantee fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Confidence score from evidential deep learning ensures selected regions are in-distribution and trustworthy.
- Mechanism: Uses evidential deep learning to quantify uncertainty, computing a confidence score as 1 minus predictive uncertainty, ensuring regions align with in-distribution data.
- Core assumption: Regions with higher confidence scores are more reliable for interpretation and less likely to be artifacts or out-of-distribution noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "We adopt a model trained by evidential deep learning (EDL) to quantify the uncertainty of a sample... the confidence score of the samplex predicted by the network can be expressed as: sconf. (x) = 1 − u"
  - [abstract]: "To enhance the attribution effect for all samples, we also impose four different constraints on the selection of sub-regions, i.e., confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores"
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct mention of evidential deep learning for attribution confidence in neighbors.
- Break condition: If the evidential model is poorly calibrated, confidence scores may not reflect true reliability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The four-score submodular function jointly optimizes interpretability from multiple perspectives, improving attribution quality.
- Mechanism: Combines confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores to evaluate subsets, ensuring selected regions are semantically meaningful, consistent with targets, and collectively impactful.
- Core assumption: A single metric cannot capture all aspects of interpretability; a multi-constraint function is needed for robust region selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "We introduce a new attribution mechanism to excavate what regions promote interpretability from four aspects, i.e., the prediction confidence of the model, the effectiveness of regional semantics, the consistency of semantics, and the collective effect of the region."
  - [abstract]: "To enhance the attribution effect for all samples, we also impose four different constraints on the selection of sub-regions, i.e., confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores, to assess the importance of various subsets."
  - [corpus]: Weak. Neighbors discuss submodular selection but not multi-constraint interpretability functions.
- Break condition: If one score dominates due to improper weighting, the balance of interpretability aspects may be lost.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Submodular functions and greedy optimization
  - Why needed here: The method relies on submodular optimization theory to select interpretable regions efficiently with approximation guarantees.
  - Quick check question: What is the key property of a submodular function that allows greedy algorithms to provide near-optimal solutions?

- Concept: Evidential deep learning for uncertainty quantification
  - Why needed here: Confidence scores are derived from evidential models to ensure selected regions are reliable and in-distribution.
  - Quick check question: How does evidential deep learning represent uncertainty differently from traditional softmax-based models?

- Concept: Image region partitioning and saliency-guided masking
  - Why needed here: Images are divided into sub-regions based on prior saliency maps to focus on semantically meaningful areas.
  - Quick check question: Why is using a saliency map to guide region division better than uniform grid partitioning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image -> Saliency map generation -> Sub-region division -> Submodular function evaluation -> Greedy subset selection -> Attribution map output
- Supporting modules: Evidential deep learning model for confidence, pre-trained feature extractor for semantic consistency, distance metric for effectiveness
- Critical path: 1) Generate saliency map using baseline attribution method 2) Divide image into sub-regions guided by saliency importance 3) Compute submodular function scores for each candidate subset 4) Use greedy search to select top-k interpretable regions 5) Output attribution map highlighting selected regions
- Design tradeoffs: Region granularity vs. computational cost: Finer division improves interpretability but increases search complexity; Number of regions (k) vs. attribution fidelity: More regions capture more context but reduce focus; Score weighting (λ1-λ4) vs. interpretability balance: Improper weights can bias selection toward one interpretability aspect
- Failure signatures: Low Insertion AUC despite high Deletion AUC: Greedy search may be selecting regions that hurt irrelevant classes; Unstable region selection across runs: Submodular function may lack sufficient constraints or the greedy algorithm may be sensitive to initialization; Poor performance on misclassified samples: Confidence score may not adequately filter out-of-distribution regions
- First 3 experiments: 1) Validate submodular property: Test if F(S∪{α})−F(S) ≥ F(T∪{α})−F(T) holds for random subsets S⊆T 2) Ablation on score components: Remove each score function individually and measure impact on Deletion/Insertion AUC 3) Compare division strategies: Test uniform grid vs. saliency-guided partitioning on a small dataset and measure attribution quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method scale with the number of sub-regions (m) and the size of the divided patches (N x N)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the method uses a sub-region division strategy guided by prior saliency maps, where images are divided into N x N patches, and d patches are sequentially allocated to each sub-region IM. The performance is influenced by the sophistication of the underlying attribution algorithm, with more advanced algorithms leading to superior results.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the number of sub-regions (m) and the size of the divided patches (N x N) affect the performance of the method. It only mentions that dividing the image into more patches yields higher average highest confidence scores but excessive division can introduce instability in the early search area.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study analyzing the performance of the method with varying numbers of sub-regions (m) and different patch sizes (N x N) would provide insights into the optimal configuration for different datasets and tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed method be extended to other types of models, such as generative models or reinforcement learning agents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on image attribution for improving model interpretability, particularly addressing the challenges of generating accurate small regions and explaining incorrect predictions. It reformulates the image attribution problem as a submodular subset selection problem and demonstrates superior performance on face and fine-grained datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the applicability of the method to other types of models, such as generative models or reinforcement learning agents. It is unclear whether the submodular subset selection approach and the four constraints (confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores) can be effectively applied to these different model types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the proposed method to generative models or reinforcement learning agents would provide evidence of its generalizability and effectiveness in explaining the decision-making processes of these models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method handle cases where the model's predictions are based on multiple, equally important regions in the image?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that some image regions have the same semantic representation and introduces the effectiveness score to maximize the response of valuable information with fewer regions. However, it does not explicitly discuss how the method handles cases where the model's predictions are based on multiple, equally important regions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the method handles cases where the model's predictions are based on multiple, equally important regions. It is unclear whether the submodular subset selection approach and the four constraints can effectively identify and attribute importance to these multiple regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the method's performance on images where the model's predictions are based on multiple, equally important regions would provide insights into its ability to handle such cases. Additionally, analyzing the method's behavior when adjusting the weighting factors for the four constraints could reveal how it balances the importance of multiple regions.

## Limitations
- The method's computational efficiency is not thoroughly benchmarked against existing approaches, leaving uncertainty about its practical applicability
- The reliance on evidential deep learning for confidence scoring introduces uncertainty about the quality of uncertainty estimates, which depends heavily on model calibration
- Limited ablation studies on the submodular function components make it difficult to isolate the contribution of each score to the overall performance

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical foundation of submodular optimization for interpretability
- Medium confidence in empirical validation due to lack of ablation studies and limited comparison with recent attribution methods
- Low confidence in generalizability to other model types and tasks due to limited exploration beyond image attribution

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each submodular score component
2. Validate the submodular property of the objective function on held-out data
3. Test the method's robustness to different saliency map generation techniques and division strategies
