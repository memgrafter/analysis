## Key Results
- Systematic survey of geometric, topological, and algebraic structures in data and models, illustrated with real-world examples and benchmark results
- Identification of key research opportunities, particularly in underexplored areas such as manifold-valued signals and decoder-free embeddings
- Demonstration of how non-Euclidean methods can respect the underlying structure of data to improve model performance and interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Non-Euclidean machine learning methods outperform Euclidean baselines when the data intrinsically lies on a curved or topologically structured space, because the model can directly respect the underlying geometry rather than approximating it with flat embeddings.
- Mechanism: The mathematical structure of the data (manifold, graph, hypergraph, Lie group) is encoded into the model's layers, enabling operations like geodesics, group convolutions, and topological message passing that are invariant to the correct symmetry group. This leads to better inductive biases and reduced parameter counts.
- Core assumption: The underlying data manifold or graph structure is known or can be inferred beforehand; the model architecture is designed to match that structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective... generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra."
  - [section III.A] "a data point on a manifold exists independently of the array with which a computer represents... the mathematical nature of the data point is unchanged"
  - [corpus] No explicit benchmark comparisons found in the neighbor papers; weak corpus evidence.
- Break Condition: If the assumed geometric/topological structure is misspecified or unknown, the inductive bias may hurt performance or require costly structure discovery.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Attention mechanisms can be made geometry-aware by replacing Euclidean similarity metrics with geodesic distances or other manifold-aware operators, preserving symmetry and enabling better modeling of hierarchical or relational data.
- Mechanism: The attention coefficient α is computed using a manifold distance (e.g., Riemannian geodesic, hyperbolic distance) instead of Euclidean distance, so the "similarity" measure matches the true data geometry. This is combined with equivariant layer operations to propagate geometric structure.
- Core assumption: The manifold metric (or group action) is available analytically or can be approximated efficiently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances"
  - [section V.B] "The multimanifold attention mechanisms by Konstantinidis et al. (2023) illustrates this configuration... their proposed geometric attention coefficient replaces the Euclidean distance by a Riemannian geodesic distance between key and query"
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers cite curvature-adaptive transformers and hyperbolic attention; weak direct evidence in provided corpus.
- Break Condition: If manifold distances are expensive to compute or approximate poorly, attention layers may become bottlenecks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-Euclidean latent embeddings can yield more compact and interpretable representations when the latent space is chosen to match the data's intrinsic geometry, enabling better generalization and generative modeling.
- Mechanism: The encoder/decoder architecture is constrained to map data into and out of a latent space that respects the correct topology or geometry (e.g., hyperbolic space for hierarchical data, Lie group latent spaces for pose). This avoids overparameterization and preserves meaningful structure.
- Core assumption: The appropriate latent space geometry is known a priori; the decoder can parameterize the data manifold accurately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field"
  - [section IV.B] "Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA)... generalizes the concept of a linear subspace to manifolds"
  - [corpus] No explicit latent embedding comparisons in neighbor papers; weak corpus evidence.
- Break Condition: If the latent space is mis-specified, the model may fail to reconstruct data accurately or generalize poorly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Riemannian geometry and manifolds
  - Why needed here: Most non-Euclidean data lies on manifolds (spheres, SPD matrices, Lie groups). Understanding geodesics, exponential/log maps, and curvature is essential to build correct models.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the Euclidean mean and the Fr\'echet mean on a sphere?
- Concept: Graph theory and simplicial complexes
  - Why needed here: Many datasets are naturally represented as graphs or higher-order complexes. Knowing how to define node features, edges, and higher-dimensional simplices is key to building topological layers.
  - Quick check question: In a graph, what is the role of the adjacency matrix in defining a convolutional layer?
- Concept: Group theory and equivariance
  - Why needed here: Symmetry groups (translations, rotations, permutations) constrain how data can transform. Building equivariant layers ensures the model respects these symmetries and reduces sample complexity.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a layer to be "translation equivariant" in the context of image convolutions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Space -> Structure Detection -> Layer Selection -> Forward Pass -> Backward Pass -> Parameter Update
- Critical path: Data → Structure detection → Appropriate layer choice → Forward pass with geometry-aware ops → Backward pass with geometry-aware gradients → Parameter update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Parameter efficiency vs. expressivity: Geometric constraints reduce parameters but may limit flexibility.
  - Computational cost vs. accuracy: Exact manifold ops (exp, log, geodesics) are expensive; approximations may be needed.
  - Structure assumption vs. robustness: Strong inductive biases help if structure is correct, hurt if misspecified.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor training loss despite correct gradients: Likely geometry mis-specification or metric approximation error.
  - Exploding/vanishing gradients in manifold layers: Metric scaling or step size issues.
  - Overfitting with few parameters: Geometry too restrictive for data complexity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline test**: Implement a simple Perceptron-Exp layer on a sphere (e.g., geographic coordinates) and compare to a vanilla MLP on a synthetic manifold dataset.
  2. **Attention geometry swap**: Replace Euclidean distance in a Transformer with hyperbolic distance on a hierarchical synthetic dataset and measure accuracy vs. parameter count.
  3. **Graph topology ablation**: Build a GCN on Cora with and without message passing; compare to a fully connected MLP baseline to quantify benefit of graph structure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs between non-Euclidean and Euclidean machine learning models in terms of parameter efficiency and training time, and how do these vary across different non-Euclidean structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how non-Euclidean structures can constrain the hypothesis search space, potentially reducing parameters, but also notes that many non-Euclidean methods require numerical optimization or complex computations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions parameter efficiency as an advantage, it only provides parameter counts for a small sample of models and does not systematically compare computational costs across different non-Euclidean structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking studies comparing parameter counts, training times, and inference times across diverse non-Euclidean models and datasets, controlling for model architecture and task complexity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can non-Euclidean machine learning methods be extended to model temporal dynamics and evolving structures, particularly for scientific applications where both geometric/topological structure and time evolution are critical?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper's conclusion explicitly identifies "Non-Euclidean Dynamical Systems" as a key opportunity, noting that current models often assume linear (Euclidean) dynamics but manifold-valued dynamics could capture richer constraints.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this as an opportunity, it does not provide specific methodologies or demonstrate how non-Euclidean structures could be integrated with dynamical systems modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of non-Euclidean dynamical systems models applied to scientific datasets where both spatial structure and temporal evolution are important, demonstrating improved performance over Euclidean baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most promising application domains for non-Euclidean machine learning beyond those currently explored, and what specific structural properties of these domains make them particularly suitable for non-Euclidean approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reviews applications in chemistry, computer vision, biomedical imaging, and physics, but explicitly states these are not exhaustive and highlights the need for further exploration.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides examples of successful applications but does not systematically analyze which domains are most amenable to non-Euclidean approaches or what properties make them suitable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies across diverse application domains, identifying structural characteristics (e.g., inherent symmetries, hierarchical relationships, manifold-valued data) that correlate with improved performance using non-Euclidean methods.

## Limitations
- Performance claims are largely theoretical with no explicit benchmark comparisons provided within the corpus to validate the superiority of non-Euclidean methods over Euclidean baselines in practical settings.
- The paper assumes the underlying data structure is known or can be inferred, but the robustness of these methods when the structure is misspecified is not deeply explored.
- Computational cost of exact manifold operations is acknowledged but not quantified across methods, leaving uncertainty about scalability.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mathematical foundations of non-Euclidean structures (manifolds, graphs, groups) and their role in machine learning are well-established and clearly explained.
- **Medium Confidence**: The survey accurately captures the current state of the field and identifies key research directions, but empirical validation of performance claims is limited.
- **Low Confidence**: The practical superiority of non-Euclidean methods over Euclidean baselines in real-world applications is asserted but not directly demonstrated with benchmarks.

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark Comparison**: Implement and compare a non-Euclidean model (e.g., hyperbolic attention or manifold CNN) against its Euclidean counterpart on a standard dataset (e.g., node classification on Cora or hierarchical data) and report accuracy, parameter count, and training time.

2. **Structure Robustness Test**: Evaluate a non-Euclidean model on a dataset where the assumed geometric structure is deliberately perturbed or unknown, and measure the degradation in performance versus a flexible Euclidean baseline.

3. **Scalability Analysis**: Profile the computational cost (runtime, memory) of exact manifold operations (geodesics, exponential maps) versus their approximations in a deep learning pipeline, and assess the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
