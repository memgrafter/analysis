# Enhancing Motion Variation in Text-to-Motion Models via Pose and Video Conditioned Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08931
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08931
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: User study shows proposed method generates unseen motions with realism comparable to commonly represented motions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of limited motion variation in text-to-motion models caused by data scarcity. Current models struggle to generate novel motions not present in training datasets, such as specific sports actions. The authors propose a method that uses short video clips or static poses as conditions to modify existing basic motions, enabling generation of motions outside the training distribution. A user study with 26 participants demonstrated that the approach produces unseen motions with realism comparable to commonly represented motions like walking and kicking.

## Method Summary
The method uses a two-stage training process with an inference stage to generate novel motions. First, a learnable embedding is optimized to produce a motion resembling the combination of a base motion and a condition motion (from video or static pose). Second, the diffusion model is fine-tuned to preserve base motion knowledge while incorporating the optimized embedding. During inference, the optimized embedding and base motion embedding are linearly combined with a weighting factor η to control the final motion characteristics. The approach leverages a pre-trained Motion Diffusion Model and HumanML3D motion representation.

## Key Results
- User study with 26 participants showed generated unseen motions have realism comparable to common dataset motions
- Method successfully generates motions not present in training data, such as kicking a football with the instep
- Generated motions maintain alignment with text conditions while incorporating motion details from video/pose conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pose and video conditions can extend the motion vocabulary beyond what's available in the training data.
- Mechanism: By conditioning the diffusion model on an additional pose or video, the model uses its learned understanding of general motions (the prior) and combines it with the specific motion details from the condition (the posterior). This allows generation of motions not seen during training.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained diffusion model has learned generalizable motion patterns that can be steered by external conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our method can create motions not present in the training set, overcoming the limitations of text-motion datasets."
  - [section]: "In the case of a video condition, such as a person kicking a football, our method takes a single short (2-5 seconds) video clip of a person kicking a football as input along with the base motion of kicking."
- Break condition: The pre-trained model lacks sufficient generalization, or the conditioning signal is too weak or noisy to guide generation effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Embedding optimization bridges the gap between the base motion and the desired edited motion.
- Mechanism: The embedding space training stage optimizes a learnable embedding variable so that when passed through the frozen diffusion model, it produces a motion resembling the combined motion (base + condition). This optimization is guided by a masked loss that focuses on relevant joints and time steps.
- Core assumption: The embedding space is sufficiently rich to encode the necessary motion variations and can be optimized to produce desired outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Using the Embedding Optimization Module, eee is trained to ensure that, when provided as input to a pre-trained motion diffusion model (kept frozen during the first stage), it produces a motion resembling the combined motion xxxC0."
- Break condition: The embedding optimization fails to converge or the optimized embedding does not produce meaningful motion changes when decoded.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linear combination of the optimized embedding and base motion embedding allows fine-grained control over the final motion.
- Mechanism: At inference, the optimized embedding and the base motion embedding are linearly combined with a weighting factor η. This allows the user to control how much of the edited motion is blended into the base motion without retraining.
- Core assumption: The embedding space is linear enough that simple interpolation produces meaningful intermediate motions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The base motion and the optimized embeddings are linearly combined according to Eq. 7 before being passed to the diffusion model to generate the final motion."
- Break condition: The embedding space is highly non-linear, making linear interpolation produce unrealistic or discontinuous motions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and their reverse process
  - Why needed here: The core generation mechanism relies on iteratively denoising random noise into a motion sequence guided by a condition.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the variance schedule (βt) in the diffusion process?

- Concept: Embedding optimization and loss masking
  - Why needed here: The method optimizes an embedding to produce a desired motion, using masked losses to focus on specific joints or time steps.
  - Quick check question: Why does the loss function mask certain components of the motion during optimization?

- Concept: Motion representation and SMPL parameter conversion
  - Why needed here: The method converts video frames and static poses into the HumanML3D motion representation used by the diffusion model.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the HumanML3D motion representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preprocessing -> Motion Combination -> Embedding Optimization -> Diffusion Model Fine-tuning -> Inference
- Critical path: Preprocessing → Motion Combination → Embedding Optimization → Diffusion Model Fine-tuning → Inference
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pros: Can generate novel motions not in training data; provides fine-grained control via conditions; data-efficient
  - Cons: Dependent on pre-trained model's generalization; sensitive to hyper-parameters; may inherit limitations of base diffusion model
- Failure signatures:
  - Unrealistic motions: Pre-trained model lacks generalization or embedding optimization failed
  - Discontinuities in motion: Poor motion combination or insufficient fine-tuning
  - No change from base motion: Embedding optimization failed to converge or η is too low
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate a simple edited motion (e.g., change arm position in a walking motion) to verify basic functionality
  2. Test with a video condition to generate a motion not in the training set (e.g., soccer kick)
  3. Vary η to explore the trade-off between base motion preservation and condition incorporation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal value for the parameter η in Eq. 7 that produces the best-generated motion, considering the trade-off between preserving base motion characteristics and incorporating combined motion features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that determining the optimal value for η is challenging due to the black-box nature of the model and heavily depends on the hyper-parameters set during the two training stages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic method for determining the optimal η value, instead suggesting visual inspection after generating motions with different η values.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing generated motions across a range of η values using quantitative metrics (e.g., motion similarity measures) and qualitative assessments could identify the optimal η range for different types of motion editing tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the diffusion model be improved to better understand physical support and realistic limb behavior, particularly for motions involving interactions with objects or requiring specific body positions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions issues with the diffusion model's understanding of physical support (e.g., in the crab walk motion) and discrepancies between upper and lower limb behavior (e.g., in the exaggerated model walk and kicking motions).
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges these limitations as characteristics of the pre-trained diffusion model itself, rather than being specific to their method, and suggests future work on incorporating physics principles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a diffusion model that incorporates physics-based constraints or is trained on data with explicit physical support annotations could demonstrate improvements in generating more realistic motions with proper limb coordination and object interactions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the method be extended to generate motions for complex, multi-step actions or interactions between multiple characters, and how would this affect the quality and realism of the generated motions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on generating single-character motions based on a base motion and a single video or pose condition, without addressing more complex scenarios involving multi-step actions or multiple characters.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation and experiments are limited to simpler motion editing tasks, and the paper does not explore the potential for extending the method to more complex scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the method to handle multi-step actions or multiple characters and conducting experiments to evaluate the quality and realism of the generated motions in these scenarios would demonstrate the method's potential for more complex motion generation tasks.

## Limitations

- Heavy dependence on pre-trained diffusion model's generalization capabilities
- High sensitivity to hyper-parameters that are not fully specified
- Small user study sample size (26 participants) for definitive conclusions

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The basic mechanism of using conditions to modify existing motions is sound and technically feasible
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of embedding optimization and diffusion model fine-tuning for generating truly novel motions
- Low Confidence: The claim that this approach can generate any arbitrary motion not present in training data

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate the method on a broader range of motion types beyond walking and kicking, including complex athletic movements or dance sequences not present in training data

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the key hyper-parameters (η, v, ρ) to determine their impact on motion quality and identify robust settings that work across different motion types

3. **Comparative Study**: Compare the proposed conditioning approach against simpler alternatives like direct motion blending or prompt engineering to quantify the benefit of the two-stage training process
