- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19025
- Authors: Md Khairul Islam; Ayush Karmacharya; Timothy Sue; Judy Fox

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the application of large language models to financial time series forecasting, particularly valuable for financial aid data where historical datasets are limited. The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art time series models including LLM-based approaches, transformer-based models, and traditional models across eight financial datasets. In few-shot learning scenarios with only 10% of training data, LLM-based models demonstrated superior performance with significantly lower MSE and MAE scores than traditional approaches. However, in zero-shot learning scenarios without any fine-tuning, LLM performance degraded substantially, indicating that pre-trained LLMs still require some adaptation to effectively handle temporal patterns in financial time series data.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates five state-of-the-art time series deep learning models and three LLM-based foundation models using GPT-2 as backbone. The experiments test both few-shot (10% training data) and zero-shot (no training) learning scenarios across eight financial datasets spanning stocks, commodities, currencies, and institutional financial aid. The models are trained using Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, dropout 0.1, batch size 32, and maximum 10 epochs. Performance is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.

## Key Results
- In few-shot learning with 10% training data, LLM-based models (TimeLLM, PatchTST) achieved significantly lower MSE and MAE scores than traditional approaches
- TimeLLM achieved best overall performance with MSE of 2.06 and MAE of 1.08 on financial aid data versus 2.94/1.36 for DLinear
- In zero-shot learning without fine-tuning, LLM performance degraded substantially across all datasets, with GPT4TS performing best but still notably worse than in few-shot setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based models demonstrate superior performance in few-shot learning with limited training data (10% of available data).
- Mechanism: Pre-trained LLMs leverage their general language understanding capabilities to capture temporal patterns even with minimal fine-tuning, effectively transferring knowledge from their pre-training to financial time series forecasting.
- Core assumption: Temporal patterns in financial time series share sufficient structural similarities with language patterns that pre-trained LLMs can generalize effectively with minimal adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In few-shot learning scenarios with only 10% of training data, LLM-based models, particularly TimeLLM and PatchTST, demonstrated superior performance with MSE and MAE scores significantly lower than traditional approaches."
  - [section] "Results. The few-shot learning results are shown in Table III. All model performance drops significantly after reducing the train data size... TimeLLM performs the best overall (three best and four 2nd best cases)."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs require some fine-tuning to effectively handle temporal patterns in financial time series data, as zero-shot performance degrades substantially.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained LLMs lack specific temporal reasoning capabilities for financial data patterns, requiring adaptation through fine-tuning to align their general knowledge with domain-specific temporal structures.
- Core assumption: Financial time series data contains unique temporal characteristics and domain-specific patterns that are not adequately captured by general language pre-training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "However, in zero-shot learning scenarios where models were evaluated without any fine-tuning, LLM performance degraded substantially across all datasets... indicating that pre-trained LLMs still require some adaptation to effectively handle the temporal patterns in financial time series data."
  - [section] "Results. Table IV shows the zero-shot results of the LLMs. Compared to Q1, the results achieved here are significantly worse... We conclude, LLMs are yet not quite effective for zero-shot learning for financial time series."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TimeLLM achieves best overall performance by reprogramming LLM reasoning capabilities for time series data through prompt-as-prefix techniques.
- Mechanism: TimeLLM modifies how LLMs process sequential data by treating time series forecasting as a language task with specialized prompting, allowing the model to leverage its existing reasoning capabilities in a new context.
- Core assumption: The prompt-as-prefix technique effectively bridges the gap between language understanding and temporal pattern recognition without requiring extensive architectural modifications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "TimeLLM [16] reprograms LLM's ability to reason with time series data by proposing a prompt-as-prefix technique."
  - [section] "TimeLLM performs the best overall (three best and four 2nd best cases)."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates model performance with only 10% of training data, requiring understanding of how models can learn effectively from limited examples.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between few-shot and zero-shot learning, and why is few-shot learning particularly valuable for financial aid forecasting?

- Concept: Time series forecasting
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on predicting future values in financial time series, requiring understanding of temporal dependencies and forecasting techniques.
  - Quick check question: How does the lookback window size (L) affect a model's ability to capture temporal patterns in financial time series?

- Concept: Transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Most evaluated models use transformer-based approaches, requiring understanding of self-attention mechanisms and their application to sequential data.
  - Quick check question: How do transformer models handle temporal dependencies differently than traditional recurrent neural networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Preprocessing → Model Training (fine-tuning for LLMs, training from scratch for traditional models) → Evaluation → Comparison across datasets and learning scenarios
- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation → Comparison across datasets and learning scenarios
- Design tradeoffs: LLM-based models offer better few-shot performance but require more computational resources and careful fine-tuning; traditional models are simpler but underperform with limited data; zero-shot learning is convenient but ineffective for financial time series
- Failure signatures: Poor performance in few-shot scenarios indicates insufficient transfer learning capability; zero-shot failures suggest need for domain adaptation; inconsistent performance across datasets may indicate overfitting to specific data characteristics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce few-shot learning results with 10% training data using TimeLLM on the Financial Aid dataset to verify the reported MSE and MAE scores.
  2. Test zero-shot performance of GPT4TS on the Currency Exchange Rate dataset to confirm the substantial degradation compared to few-shot results.
  3. Compare traditional transformer model (iTransformer) performance with LLM-based model (CALF) on the Stock Market dataset using identical data splits and evaluation metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do LLM-based models perform in few-shot and zero-shot settings when applied to new financial domains not represented in the current datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that LLMs performed well in few-shot settings for the tested financial domains but failed in zero-shot settings.
- Why unresolved: The current study is limited to eight specific financial datasets, and the generalizability of LLM performance to entirely new financial domains is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing LLM-based models on a broader range of new financial domains (e.g., cryptocurrency, real estate, or economic indicators) and comparing their performance in few-shot and zero-shot settings to traditional models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can incorporating multimodal data (e.g., news, social media sentiment) improve the forecasting accuracy of LLM-based models for financial time series?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on point forecasting with single modality and mentions that incorporating data from different financial modalities could be future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses historical numerical data for forecasting, and the potential benefits of multimodal data integration are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that incorporate multimodal data into LLM-based models and comparing their performance to models using only historical numerical data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of LLM-based models compare to traditional models in probabilistic forecasting for financial time series?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on point forecasting and mentions that probabilistic forecasting could help the financial domain by outputting a probabilistic distribution.
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates point forecasting performance, and the potential advantages of LLM-based models in probabilistic forecasting are not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the performance of LLM-based models and traditional models in probabilistic forecasting tasks using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., CRPS, pinball loss).

## Limitations

- The study's claims about LLM effectiveness may not generalize beyond the specific eight datasets tested, which may not represent broader financial time series applications
- The paper does not address computational costs and resource requirements for fine-tuning large language models, which could be prohibitive for many practical applications
- The fundamental limitations of pre-trained LLMs for time series forecasting remain unclear, particularly whether architectural constraints or insufficient temporal reasoning in pre-training cause zero-shot failures

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Few-shot learning performance of TimeLLM and PatchTST with limited training data (10% of available data) showing significantly better MSE and MAE scores than traditional approaches.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that LLMs require fine-tuning for effective financial time series forecasting, as zero-shot performance degrades substantially across all datasets.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of TimeLLM's prompt-as-prefix technique for reprogramming LLM reasoning capabilities for time series data, based on superior overall performance metrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate TimeLLM on financial time series datasets from different domains (e.g., cryptocurrency, real estate, or economic indicators) to verify whether the few-shot learning advantages extend beyond the original eight datasets.

2. **Computational cost analysis**: Measure and report the computational resources required for fine-tuning LLM-based models versus training traditional transformer models from scratch, including GPU memory usage, training time, and inference latency.

3. **Architectural investigation**: Conduct ablation studies to isolate which components of TimeLLM's approach (prompt-as-prefix technique, GPT-2 backbone, specific fine-tuning procedures) contribute most significantly to performance improvements, helping determine whether simpler adaptations could achieve similar results.
