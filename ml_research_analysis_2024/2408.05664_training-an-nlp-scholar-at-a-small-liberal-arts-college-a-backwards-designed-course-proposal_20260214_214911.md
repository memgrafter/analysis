# Training an NLP Scholar at a Small Liberal Arts College: A Backwards Designed Course Proposal

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.05664
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05664
- Authors: Grusha Prasad; Forrest Davis
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Proposes a backwards-designed course for training NLP scholars at small liberal arts colleges, emphasizing critical thinking and effective use of existing tools.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a course design for training NLP scholars at small liberal arts colleges, distinguishing between NLP engineers who build systems and NLP scholars who critically engage with language technology. The authors argue that current NLP education often focuses on training engineers but neglects the development of scholars who can effectively use existing tools and evaluate claims about NLP systems. They propose a backwards-designed course with a capstone project as the central component, supported by a midterm replication project and a society reflection paper.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a backwards design approach, starting by articulating the skills an NLP scholar should possess: describing language processing, effectively using existing NLP tools, and evaluating claims about NLP systems. They then propose course components including a layered approach to introducing concepts, lab-lecture integration, a modular toolkit, a midterm replication project, and a capstone project with five phases. The course design aims to balance foundational knowledge with exposure to contemporary NLP approaches, enabling students with limited programming experience to engage meaningfully in research projects.

## Key Results
- The course design distinguishes between NLP engineers and NLP scholars, addressing a gap in current NLP education
- A backwards design approach ensures course components are intentionally aligned with desired skills
- The capstone project structure allows students to develop skills through incremental phases while maintaining flexibility for diverse project topics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The backward design approach ensures course components are intentionally aligned with the skills students need to become NLP scholars.
- Mechanism: The authors explicitly define desired skills (S1, S2, S3), then design course components (layered concepts, labs, toolkit, midterm, capstone, society reflection) that directly target these skills.
- Core assumption: Skills can be clearly articulated and translated into specific course activities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using a backward design, we start by articulating what are the skills that an NLP scholar should have, and propose a set of course principles/tenets that can facilitate the acquisition of these skills."
  - [section 3] "There are three skills we want the NLP scholars we train to have... S1: Describe language processing... S2: Effectively using existing NLP tools... S3: Evaluate claims about NLP systems."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - only 25 related papers found with average FMR of 0.442, suggesting this approach may not be widely discussed in existing literature.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The layered approach to introducing concepts helps students with limited programming experience engage with contemporary NLP approaches in their capstone projects.
- Mechanism: The authors propose starting with a high-level introduction to the NLP pipeline, then progressively un-blackboxing different components as the course progresses. This is supported by a modular toolkit that allows students to use working implementations early while gradually implementing components themselves.
- Core assumption: Students can engage meaningfully with complex systems when provided with scaffolding and progressive complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "We propose to address this by using a layered approach to introducing concepts and designing labs early in the semester that scaffold some of the aspects common to all projects such as data pre-processing and generating plots."
  - [section 4.3] "Our toolkit seeks to balance these two needs by being modular... Each of these components can be supplemented with student implementations."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - no direct discussion of layered approaches for NLP education in the corpus.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The midterm replication project provides essential practice with existing codebases and scientific communication, preparing students for their capstone projects.
- Mechanism: Students replicate existing work in a structured format, gaining experience with working with code, hypothesis generation, result interpretation, and science communication before tackling their own novel projects.
- Core assumption: Replicating existing work provides transferable skills for conducting original research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "To scaffold the final project, the middle of the semester culminates in a midterm project... The intention of this project is to provide students an opportunity to concretely apply skills relevant to the final paper, but in a more structured format."
  - [section 4.4] "Development of these skills are facilitated in lab and in the production of their midterm paper."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence - no direct discussion of midterm replication projects in NLP education in the corpus.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Backward design
  - Why needed here: The authors use backward design to ensure course components are intentionally aligned with the skills students need to become NLP scholars.
  - Quick check question: How does the backward design approach differ from traditional course design, and why is it particularly suited for this NLP course?

- Concept: Layered approach to concepts
  - Why needed here: This approach helps students with limited programming experience engage with contemporary NLP approaches in their capstone projects.
  - Quick check question: How does the layered approach to introducing concepts help students progress from using existing tools to implementing their own components?

- Concept: Scaffolded learning through replication
  - Why needed here: The midterm replication project provides essential practice with existing codebases and scientific communication, preparing students for their capstone projects.
  - Quick check question: How does replicating existing work prepare students for conducting original research in their capstone projects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The course architecture consists of six main components: layered approach to introducing concepts, lab-lecture integration, toolkit, midterm replication project, capstone project, and society reflection. Each component is designed to target specific skills and principles outlined in the backward design.

- Critical path: The critical path for a student in this course would be: 1) Engage with the high-level NLP pipeline introduction, 2) Participate in labs that build foundational skills, 3) Use the toolkit to implement early experiments, 4) Complete the midterm replication project, 5) Develop and execute the capstone project, 6) Reflect on societal implications.

- Design tradeoffs: The course trades depth of coverage for breadth and practical application. Instead of covering all NLP topics in depth, it focuses on providing students with the skills to engage with NLP tools and research critically. The layered approach and modular toolkit allow for progressive complexity without overwhelming students.

- Failure signatures: If students are not engaging with the material or struggling to complete their projects, potential failure points could be: 1) The scaffolding is insufficient, 2) The progression is too slow/fast, 3) The replication project is not well-aligned with capstone skills, 4) The toolkit is not user-friendly or well-documented.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple tokenizer as part of the toolkit and use it in a basic text classification task.
  2. Replicate a simple NLP paper focusing on a single technique (e.g., sentiment analysis with a basic model).
  3. Create a small dataset and use the toolkit to explore different preprocessing techniques and their effects on model performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively balance the need for students to develop a deep understanding of foundational NLP concepts with the desire to expose them to contemporary tools and techniques early in the course?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the tension between spending time on foundational concepts and introducing contemporary approaches early to enable ambitious capstone projects.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes a layered approach to introducing concepts and a modular toolkit, but does not provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in achieving the desired balance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating student learning outcomes and project quality in courses with different balances of foundational and contemporary content, using the proposed layered approach and toolkit.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific challenges and best practices for scaling the highly scaffolded capstone project approach to larger class sizes or different educational contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that the proposed capstone project structure requires ample one-on-one time with students, which may be difficult to scale in larger classes or different contexts.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific strategies or evidence on how to adapt the approach for larger classes or different educational settings, such as R1 universities or other disciplines.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or pilot implementations of the capstone project approach in different class sizes and educational contexts, with evaluations of student outcomes and instructor workload.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we effectively assess students' ability to critically engage with societal issues related to NLP, beyond simply repeating platitudes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a "Society reflection" paper where students evaluate arguments about societal implications of NLP advances, but acknowledges the challenge of assessing critical engagement beyond platitudes.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed rubric or empirical evidence on how to effectively assess the depth of students' critical thinking and argumentation skills in this context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of assessment rubrics for the "Society reflection" paper, with examples of student work demonstrating varying levels of critical engagement, and instructor feedback on the effectiveness of the assessment in promoting deeper thinking.

## Limitations

- The proposed course design is theoretical and has not been empirically validated in an actual classroom setting.
- The course assumes a specific institutional context (small liberal arts college) that may not generalize to other educational settings.
- The backward design approach relies heavily on the ability to clearly articulate desired skills and translate them into specific course components.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The distinction between NLP engineers and NLP scholars, and the identification of three core skills (S1, S2, S3) that NLP scholars should possess.
- **Medium confidence**: The backward design approach and the specific course components (layered concepts, labs, toolkit, midterm, capstone, society reflection) as mechanisms to develop these skills.
- **Low confidence**: The specific implementation details of the modular toolkit and the exact structure of the midterm replication project.

## Next Checks

1. **Pilot implementation**: Implement a reduced version of the course (e.g., focus on one skill area) in a real classroom setting to gather preliminary data on student engagement, learning outcomes, and course mechanics.
2. **Toolkit development and testing**: Develop and test the modular toolkit with a small group of students to assess its usability, effectiveness in scaffolding student learning, and ability to support capstone projects.
3. **Rubric validation**: Validate the assessment rubrics (for the midterm and capstone projects) with experienced NLP educators to ensure they accurately measure the intended skills and provide meaningful feedback to students.
