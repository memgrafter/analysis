# Categorical Syllogisms Revisited: A Review of the Logical Reasoning Abilities of LLMs for Analyzing Categorical Syllogism

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.18762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18762
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Template-based synthetic datasets achieve better coverage of syllogism configurations compared to crowdsourcing approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic review of how large language models (LLMs) perform on categorical syllogism reasoning tasks. The authors examine all possible syllogism configurations (mood and figure) from a logician's perspective and analyze how existing datasets cover these configurations. They find that template-based synthetic datasets systematically cover all possible configurations, while crowdsourcing approaches sacrifice configuration coverage for more natural language variations. The study reveals that LLMs struggle most with translating natural language quantifiers into standard categorical forms, which is identified as the primary bottleneck in syllogistic reasoning performance.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a comprehensive review of existing syllogism datasets (SylloFigure, Avicenna, and Reasoning) and evaluate their coverage of the 256 possible mood-figure configurations. They use GPT-4 and GPT-4o with zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting to assess LLM performance on validity inference across these configurations. The study systematically analyzes error rates broken down by configuration types and examines how different dataset generation approaches (template-based vs. crowdsourcing) affect configuration coverage. The authors also investigate the impact of existential import assumptions on validity judgments and provide recommendations for future dataset development.

## Key Results
- Template-based synthetic datasets achieve complete coverage of all 256 syllogism configurations, while crowdsourcing approaches focus on only a subset of configurations
- LLMs demonstrate significantly higher error rates when translating natural language quantifiers into standard categorical proposition forms
- Existential import assumptions affect validity judgments in 9 out of 24 valid syllogism configurations, with most prior works implicitly making this assumption
- The interpretation of quantifiers represents the current bottleneck limiting LLM performance in syllogistic reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Template-based synthetic datasets achieve higher configuration coverage of categorical syllogisms compared to crowdsourcing approaches.
- Mechanism: Template-based approaches systematically generate all possible mood-figure combinations by filling relation triples into fixed categorical proposition templates, ensuring comprehensive configuration coverage.
- Core assumption: Relation triples from structured sources (like Wikidata) can be mapped onto categorical proposition templates without loss of logical validity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "template-based synthetic datasets have better coverage of configurations (mood and figure) compared to crowdsourcing approaches"
  - [section 3.3.2]: "Regarding the coverage of configurations, we observe that compared to template-based datasets, datasets using human-generated text are normally centered on a few specific moods and figures"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly address configuration coverage differences
- Break condition: If relation triples contain contextual or semantic dependencies that cannot be cleanly mapped to categorical forms, coverage may be artificially inflated without maintaining logical validity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs struggle most with translating natural language quantifiers into standard categorical proposition forms.
- Mechanism: The interpretation of quantifiers (especially non-standard ones like "few", "not every", or ambiguous terms like "some") introduces ambiguity that LLMs handle inconsistently, leading to errors in validity inference.
- Core assumption: The difficulty of quantifier interpretation is the primary bottleneck, not the underlying logical inference ability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The error rate breakdown analyses suggest that the interpretation of the quantifiers seems to be the current bottleneck"
  - [section 4.3]: "Our observation is that translating into standard propositions is the most challenging part for LLMs"
  - [section 4.3]: "LLMs tend to confuse universal affirmative (A) with particular affirmative (I)"
- Break condition: If the LLM has been specifically trained or fine-tuned on quantifier-specific tasks, or if the reasoning task uses only standard quantifiers (A, E, I, O), this bottleneck may not manifest.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Existential import assumptions affect validity judgments in 9 out of 24 valid syllogism configurations.
- Mechanism: The validity of certain syllogism forms depends on whether the premises imply the existence of members in the categories, which is often unstated in datasets.
- Core assumption: Researchers are aware of existential import implications and either make them explicit or consistently apply the same assumption across datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1]: "There are 24 valid configurations over all 256 cases, 9 of which rely on the existential import assumption"
  - [section 5.1]: "We notice that nearly all prior works, except Ando et al. (2023), implicitly make such an assumption"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't provide evidence about existential import handling
- Break condition: If a dataset explicitly addresses existential import by including both interpretations or by providing clear instructions to annotators, this mechanism would not apply.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generalized quantifier theory
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses how different quantifiers (including non-standard ones) affect LLM performance, requiring understanding of how quantifiers map to set operations
  - Quick check question: How would you represent "some S are P" using set theory notation?

- Concept: Venn diagram reasoning for syllogisms
  - Why needed here: The paper mentions Venn diagrams as one method for checking validity, and understanding this helps grasp why configuration coverage matters
  - Quick check question: What Venn diagram would represent the syllogism "All Greeks are humans; All Athenians are Greeks; Therefore, all Athenians are humans"?

- Concept: Mood-figure configuration system
  - Why needed here: The paper's core analysis revolves around the 256 possible mood-figure combinations and their coverage in datasets
  - Quick check question: How many different configurations exist for categorical syllogisms, and how are they determined?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation → Translation module → Configuration detection → Validity inference → Evaluation framework
- Critical path: Data generation → Translation → Configuration detection → Validity inference → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Template-based approaches offer complete configuration coverage but may lack linguistic diversity
  - Crowdsourcing provides natural language variety but sacrifices configuration coverage
  - Translation accuracy vs. computational efficiency in the translation module
  - Explicit vs. implicit existential import handling
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor translation accuracy (especially with quantifiers) manifests as high error rates across all configurations
  - Skewed configuration coverage indicates dataset generation bias
  - Inconsistent results between different LLM models suggest translation rather than reasoning issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test translation accuracy on a small set of hand-crafted syllogisms with varying quantifier complexity
  2. Compare configuration coverage between template-generated and crowdsourced datasets on the same relation set
  3. Measure performance impact of explicitly stating existential import assumptions in the prompt

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the interpretation of different quantifiers affect the performance of large language models (LLMs) in categorical syllogism tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the interpretation of quantifiers is the current bottleneck limiting LLM performance in syllogistic reasoning tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a key challenge but does not provide detailed experimental evidence on how specific quantifiers impact performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing LLM performance across different quantifiers (universal, particular, singular, generalized) with systematic error analysis would clarify this bottleneck.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between linguistic variation and coverage of syllogism configurations in benchmark datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that crowdsourcing approaches sacrifice configuration coverage for more language variations, but doesn't specify an optimal trade-off.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this trade-off, it doesn't provide guidance on how to balance these competing priorities in dataset design.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing model performance on datasets with different balances of linguistic variation and configuration coverage would help determine optimal dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different approaches to enhancing logical reasoning in LLMs (external modules vs. internal incorporation) compare in terms of effectiveness for syllogistic reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions two lines of research for enhancing logical reasoning abilities but doesn't compare their effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges these approaches exist but doesn't provide comparative analysis of their performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparative studies measuring the effectiveness of external theorem provers versus internally incorporated reasoning capabilities on syllogistic reasoning tasks would clarify this question.

## Limitations
- The analysis is primarily based on existing datasets and their documentation, which may not fully capture generation nuances
- Focus on GPT-4 and GPT-4o may not generalize to other LLM architectures or smaller models
- The paper's confidence in findings varies across different claim clusters, with some claims having weaker evidence support

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The systematic review of existing work and the enumeration of possible syllogism configurations from a logician's perspective are well-supported by the literature and formal logic foundations.
- **Medium Confidence**: The comparison of configuration coverage between template-based and crowdsourcing approaches is reasonable but may not account for all dataset generation nuances.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about quantifier interpretation being the primary bottleneck is supported by error analysis but could be influenced by the specific evaluation setup.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a replication study using a different LLM architecture (e.g., Claude or LLaMA) to verify if the quantifier interpretation bottleneck is consistent across models.
2. Perform a controlled experiment generating both template-based and crowdsourced datasets from the same underlying relation set to isolate the impact of generation method on configuration coverage.
3. Create a small-scale study explicitly testing existential import assumptions by evaluating the same syllogisms with and without explicit statements about category existence.
