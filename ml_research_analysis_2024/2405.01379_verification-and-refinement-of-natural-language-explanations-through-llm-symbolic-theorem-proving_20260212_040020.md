# Verification and Refinement of Natural Language Explanations through LLM-Symbolic Theorem Proving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.01379
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01379
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Explanation-Refiner framework for verifying and refining natural language explanations in NLI tasks using LLMs and theorem provers

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Explanation-Refiner, a neuro-symbolic framework that combines Large Language Models with Theorem Provers to verify and refine natural language explanations for Natural Language Inference tasks. The system translates explanations into formal logical representations using Neo-Davidsonian event semantics and First-Order Logic, enabling automated logical validation and iterative refinement through external theorem prover feedback. The framework addresses the challenge of ensuring logical validity in LLM-generated explanations, which often contain errors despite appearing plausible.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through three main stages: explanation translation, logical validation, and refinement. First, natural language explanations are translated into formal logical representations using Neo-Davidsonian event semantics and First-Order Logic. Second, a theorem prover evaluates the logical validity of these representations. Third, if invalid, the LLM iteratively refines the explanation based on the theorem prover's feedback until a logically valid explanation is produced. The approach is evaluated across three NLI datasets (e-SNLI, QASC, and WorldTree) using GPT-4 as the underlying LLM, demonstrating significant improvements in logical validity and reductions in syntax errors.

## Key Results
- Improved logical validity from 36% to 84% on e-SNLI dataset using GPT-4
- Increased validity from 12% to 55% on QASC dataset
- Enhanced validity from 2% to 37% on WorldTree dataset
- Reduced syntax errors by up to 68.67% across datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a closed feedback loop between LLMs and symbolic theorem provers. LLMs generate natural language explanations that are translated into formal logic using Neo-Davidsonian event semantics, which captures event structures and relationships. The theorem prover then validates these logical representations, identifying inconsistencies or violations of logical rules. When invalid explanations are detected, the LLM receives specific feedback about logical failures and iteratively refines the explanation until it passes formal validation. This neuro-symbolic integration leverages the LLM's natural language generation capabilities while relying on the theorem prover's rigorous logical reasoning to ensure validity.

## Foundational Learning
- Neo-Davidsonian event semantics: A formal semantic framework that represents events as primary entities with associated participants and roles; needed to capture the structured nature of events in natural language explanations and translate them into formal logic
- First-Order Logic (FOL): A formal system using quantified variables over non-logical objects; required for representing natural language statements in a form that theorem provers can evaluate for logical validity
- Theorem Provers: Automated systems that verify logical statements against formal axioms and inference rules; essential for providing objective, rigorous validation of explanation logic beyond LLM-based assessment
- Natural Language Inference (NLI): The task of determining whether a hypothesis can be inferred from a premise; serves as the testbed for evaluating explanation quality in reasoning tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** LLM -> Translation Module -> Theorem Prover -> Feedback Loop -> Refined LLM Output

**Critical Path:** Natural language explanation → Logical translation → Theorem prover validation → LLM refinement (iterative until valid)

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes logical validity over explanation fluency, potentially sacrificing some natural language coherence for formal correctness. This tradeoff is necessary to ensure explanations are not just plausible-sounding but actually logically sound.

**Failure Signatures:** Invalid logical representations often stem from ambiguous event structures, missing quantifiers, or incorrect predicate assignments during translation. The system can detect these through theorem prover feedback but may struggle with highly complex nested reasoning chains.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate translation accuracy by comparing automatically generated logical forms against human-annotated logical representations on a subset of explanations
2. Test theorem prover sensitivity by introducing controlled logical errors and measuring detection rates
3. Evaluate iteration efficiency by measuring the average number of refinement cycles needed to achieve validity across different explanation complexities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting its framework and results.

## Limitations
- Results are primarily based on GPT-4, raising questions about generalizability to other LLM architectures
- Potential biases in the translation process from natural language to formal logic are not extensively addressed
- Computational overhead from iterative theorem proving refinement cycles is not thoroughly discussed
- Limited evaluation of the framework's performance on longer, more complex inference chains beyond the current NLI datasets

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in core claims regarding improved logical validity, as methodology is well-defined and results show consistent improvements
- **Medium** confidence in scalability and real-world applicability due to limited discussion of computational efficiency and resource requirements
- **Medium** confidence in syntax error reduction metrics, as specific error categorization methods are not fully detailed

## Next Checks
1. Test the Explanation-Refiner framework with alternative LLM architectures (e.g., open-source models like LLaMA or Mistral) to assess model dependency
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Neo-Davidsonian event semantics versus First-Order Logic translation in improving validity
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on longer, more complex inference chains to assess scalability beyond the current NLI datasets
