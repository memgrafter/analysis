# Improving Generalization on the ProcGen Benchmark with Simple Architectural Changes and Scale
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10905
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Architectural modifications reduce optimality gap by 37.9% on ProcGen benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that simple architectural changes can significantly improve generalization performance on the ProcGen benchmark. The authors propose three modifications to the VSOP algorithm: frame stacking for temporal context, 3D convolutions to extract spatiotemporal features, and scaling up convolutional kernels to increase model capacity. These modifications collectively reduce the optimality gap from 0.58 to 0.36, representing a 37.9% improvement over the baseline. The results achieve performance competitive with or exceeding current state-of-the-art methods, suggesting these architectural changes are both effective and complementary to existing generalization approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors propose three architectural modifications applied to the VSOP algorithm for improving generalization on the ProcGen benchmark. First, frame stacking provides temporal context by concatenating consecutive frames, allowing the model to capture motion and state transitions. Second, replacing 2D convolutions with 3D convolutions enables the extraction of spatiotemporal features from the stacked frames, which is particularly important for dynamic environments. Third, scaling up the number of convolutional kernels increases the model's capacity to learn more complex representations. These modifications are evaluated through experiments on the ProcGen benchmark suite, measuring the optimality gap between training and held-out test environments.

## Key Results
- Frame stacking, 3D convolutions, and increased model capacity reduce optimality gap by 37.9% (from 0.58 to 0.36)
- Performance competitive with or exceeding current state-of-the-art generalization methods
- The three modifications are shown to be complementary when combined
- Improvements demonstrate scalability of simple architectural changes for generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed architectural modifications work by addressing key limitations in temporal representation and model capacity. Frame stacking provides the temporal context necessary for understanding state transitions and motion patterns, which are critical for generalizing across procedurally generated environments. 3D convolutions extend this capability by learning spatiotemporal features directly from the stacked frames, capturing motion dynamics and temporal dependencies more effectively than treating each frame independently. Scaling up convolutional kernels increases the model's representational capacity, allowing it to learn more complex and diverse features necessary for handling the wide variety of environments in ProcGen. Together, these modifications create a more powerful and temporally-aware architecture that can better generalize across the diverse and dynamic environments present in the benchmark.

## Foundational Learning
**Reinforcement Learning**: The framework for training agents to maximize cumulative rewards through interaction with environments; needed to understand the optimization objective and evaluation metrics.
*Why needed*: Provides the foundation for understanding how agents learn and are evaluated on ProcGen.
*Quick check*: Verify understanding of reward maximization and policy optimization.

**Temporal Credit Assignment**: The challenge of determining which actions are responsible for eventual outcomes in sequential decision-making; crucial for understanding why temporal context matters.
*Why needed*: Explains why frame stacking and spatiotemporal features are important for generalization.
*Quick check*: Can you explain how temporal information helps in credit assignment?

**Convolutional Neural Networks**: Deep learning architectures specialized for processing grid-like data such as images; fundamental to understanding the architectural modifications.
*Why needed*: The core building blocks being modified in this work.
*Quick check*: Understand how 2D convolutions work and how they differ from 3D convolutions.

**Procedural Generation**: The algorithmic creation of content (in this case, game levels); essential for understanding the ProcGen benchmark's purpose.
*Why needed*: Provides context for why generalization is challenging and important.
*Quick check*: Can you explain how procedural generation creates distribution shifts?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Frames -> Frame Stacker -> 3D Convolutional Network -> Scaled Convolutional Layers -> Value/Policy Network -> Agent Output
**Critical Path**: The temporal feature extraction pipeline from stacked frames through 3D convolutions to the final policy/value networks is the critical path for achieving generalization gains.
**Design Tradeoffs**: 3D convolutions provide spatiotemporal feature extraction but increase computational cost compared to 2D convolutions; frame stacking increases memory requirements but provides essential temporal context; scaling kernels increases capacity but also computational demands.
**Failure Signatures**: If 3D convolutions fail to provide benefits, performance may plateau despite increased computational cost; insufficient frame stacking depth may result in poor temporal feature learning; over-scaling kernels may lead to overfitting to training environments.
**First Experiments**:
1. Compare performance with and without frame stacking to isolate temporal context benefits
2. Evaluate 2D vs 3D convolutions with identical frame stacking to measure spatiotemporal feature extraction impact
3. Test different scaling factors for convolutional kernels to find optimal capacity-performance tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of ablation studies to determine individual contributions of each architectural modification
- Limited evaluation to the ProcGen benchmark, which has relatively short episodes and limited environmental diversity
- No analysis of computational efficiency or whether the overhead of 3D convolutions is justified by performance gains
- Scalability of modifications to other reinforcement learning algorithms beyond VSOP is not established

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The specific claim that architectural modifications improve performance on the ProcGen benchmark with VSOP is supported by methodologically sound experiments with appropriate baselines.
**Medium confidence**: The broader claims about these modifications being "simple" and "complementary" to existing approaches, as well as their generalizability beyond VSOP and ProcGen, are less well-supported due to insufficient comparative analysis and limited scope.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each architectural modification and determine whether improvements are additive or synergistic
2. Test these architectural changes across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms (not just VSOP) to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate performance on additional generalization benchmarks beyond ProcGen to verify that improvements transfer to different domains and task distributions
