# Assessing The Potential Of Mid-Sized Language Models For Clinical QA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.15894
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15894
- Reference count: 18
- Mid-sized open-source language models (Mistral 7B, LLaMA 2, BioGPT-large, BioMedLM) achieve up to 63.0% accuracy on clinical QA tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates mid-sized open-source language models on clinical question-answering tasks, finding that Mistral 7B outperforms biomedical-specialist models like BioGPT-large and BioMedLM on both multiple-choice and long-form clinical QA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that general-purpose models with more parameters can sometimes outperform smaller, domain-specialized alternatives in medical applications. While performance approaches that of larger proprietary models like Med-PaLM, the study emphasizes that further refinement and expert oversight remain necessary before clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four mid-sized language models (BioGPT-large, BioMedLM, LLaMA 2, and Mistral 7B) on two clinical QA benchmarks: MedQA (USMLE-style multiple choice) and MultiMedQA Long Form Question Answering (consumer health queries). All models undergo fine-tuning using Hugging Face with hyperparameter sweeps on the training data. MedQA evaluation uses accuracy metrics, while MultiMedQA responses are assessed by clinicians across multiple quality dimensions including completeness, error-freeness, appropriateness, harm potential, and bias.

## Key Results
- Mistral 7B achieved the highest MedQA accuracy at 63.0%, significantly outperforming biomedical-specialist models
- Mistral 7B also showed strong performance on long-form QA according to clinician reviews, though not quite matching the original Med-PaLM
- Larger general English models (Mistral 7B, LLaMA 2) outperformed smaller biomedical models on both tasks
- The study demonstrates potential for mid-sized models in clinical applications while highlighting need for expert oversight

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of larger general-purpose models over smaller biomedical-specialized models suggests that model scale and general language understanding may be more critical than domain-specific pretraining for certain clinical QA tasks. The generalist models likely benefit from broader knowledge coverage and stronger reasoning capabilities that compensate for less medical-specific pretraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical QA benchmarking**: Standard evaluation frameworks for medical question answering (why needed: establishes performance baselines; quick check: verify dataset splits and evaluation metrics)
- **Fine-tuning methodology**: Adapting pretrained models to specific tasks through additional training (why needed: enables models to learn task-specific patterns; quick check: monitor training loss and validation performance)
- **Clinician review protocols**: Structured assessment of model outputs by medical experts (why needed: provides qualitative evaluation beyond simple accuracy; quick check: ensure rubric consistency across reviewers)

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Fine-tuning pipeline -> Model evaluation -> Clinician review process

### Critical Path
Fine-tuning (MedQA training data) -> Development set evaluation -> Hyperparameter selection -> Test set evaluation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Model size vs. domain specialization: Larger general models outperformed smaller biomedical models
- Quantitative vs. qualitative evaluation: Combined accuracy metrics with clinician review scores
- Training data quantity vs. quality: Used curated datasets but limited by available medical QA examples

### Failure Signatures
- Poor performance indicates suboptimal hyperparameters or insufficient fine-tuning
- Inconsistent clinician scores suggest ambiguous questions or inadequate reviewer training
- Model hallucinations point to knowledge gaps requiring either retrieval augmentation or additional training data

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test different prompt formats on MedQA to establish sensitivity to prompt engineering
2. Run inter-rater reliability analysis on clinician review scores
3. Evaluate Mistral 7B on an independent clinical QA dataset for generalization testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would larger biomedical specialist models (10-20B parameters) trained on biomedical text compare to Mistral 7B in clinical QA tasks? The paper only tested models up to 2.7B parameters specifically trained on biomedical text. No evaluation was conducted on larger biomedical models. Head-to-head comparison of a 10-20B biomedical specialist model against Mistral 7B on both MedQA and MultiMedQA tasks would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between model size, domain specialization, and general language capability for clinical QA applications? The study only compared three models across two tasks. The relationship between model size, domain specialization, and performance across different clinical QA scenarios remains unclear. Systematic evaluation of models across a spectrum of sizes and domain specializations on diverse clinical QA benchmarks would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How does retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) impact the performance of mid-sized models on clinical QA tasks? The paper mentions RAG as a potential future direction for improving clinical QA performance but does not implement it. The study only evaluated base model performance without incorporating retrieval mechanisms that could provide additional medical knowledge. Comparison of mid-sized models with and without RAG on clinical QA tasks, measuring the impact on accuracy, hallucination rates, and response completeness would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Absence of exact prompt-response templates limits reproducibility of results
- Clinician review scores rely on subjective assessment with potential inter-rater variability
- Claims about clinical application potential require additional real-world validation beyond benchmark performance

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The relative ranking of models (Mistral 7B outperforming others on both MedQA and MultiMedQA) is robust given consistent results across multiple metrics and evaluation methods.

**Medium confidence**: The absolute performance numbers (63.0% MedQA accuracy, specific clinician review scores) are credible but should be interpreted cautiously due to the subjective nature of the long-form evaluation and potential variations in prompt engineering.

**Low confidence**: Claims about "potential for clinical applications" require additional real-world validation, as current evidence is based solely on benchmark performance without deployment studies or user-centered evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt engineering sensitivity**: Systematically vary prompt templates for both MedQA and MultiMedQA tasks to establish the stability of reported performance differences between models.

2. **Clinician inter-rater reliability**: Calculate Cohen's kappa or similar statistics for the clinician review process to quantify agreement levels and identify any systematic biases in scoring.

3. **Generalization test**: Evaluate the best-performing model (Mistral 7B) on an independent clinical QA dataset not used in the original study to verify that performance gains are not specific to the training corpus.
