# MultiCast: Zero-Shot Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14748
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Introduces MultiCast, a zero-shot LLM-based approach for multivariate time series forecasting using token multiplexing and SAX quantization, achieving competitive accuracy with reduced computational costs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MultiCast, a novel zero-shot approach for multivariate time series forecasting using large language models (LLMs). The key innovation lies in addressing the challenge of applying LLMs to multivariate data through three token multiplexing techniques that reduce dimensionality while preserving patterns. Additionally, the paper employs SAX quantization to simplify input representation and significantly reduce computational costs. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiCast achieves competitive forecasting accuracy while offering substantial execution time improvements.

## Method Summary
MultiCast transforms multivariate time series data into a format suitable for LLM processing through a two-step approach. First, it applies token multiplexing techniques (digit-interleaving, value-interleaving, or value-concatenation) to combine multiple dimensions into a single token sequence. Second, it employs SAX quantization to convert continuous values into symbolic representations, reducing each timestamp to a single token. The preprocessed data is then passed to an LLM (tested with LLaMA2 and Phi-2) using zero-shot prompting. The LLM generates future values based on learned patterns, and the output is demultiplexed and descaled to produce the final forecast.

## Key Results
- MultiCast achieves competitive forecasting accuracy compared to baseline methods on Gas Rate, Electricity, and Weather datasets
- Execution times are significantly reduced when using SAX quantization, with some cases showing improvements of 20-60%
- The optimal multiplexing technique varies by dataset and dimension, with no single approach consistently outperforming others across all scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The token multiplexing approach enables LLMs to process multivariate time series data by reducing multiple dimensions into a single token sequence while preserving patterns.
- Mechanism: The three multiplexing techniques (digit-interleaving, value-interleaving, value-concatenation) transform multi-dimensional time series into one-dimensional token sequences that can be processed by LLMs designed for text.
- Core assumption: LLMs can learn to demultiplex the processed sequence and recover the original multivariate structure while maintaining pattern recognition capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "three novel token multiplexing solutions that effectively reduce dimensionality while preserving key repetitive patterns"
  - [section] "We introduce three dimensional multiplexing techniques to combine all dimensions into a single string, passed to an LLM as input"
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot effectively learn the demultiplexing process, the approach will fail to produce accurate multivariate forecasts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SAX quantization simplifies the time series representation and reduces computational costs while maintaining pattern information.
- Mechanism: SAX converts continuous time series values into symbolic representations using a predefined alphabet, reducing each timestamp to a single token instead of multiple digits.
- Core assumption: The symbolic representation preserves sufficient information for the LLM to detect patterns while significantly reducing token count and computational complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a quantization scheme helps LLMs to better learn these patterns, while significantly reducing token use for practical applications"
  - [section] "We quantize the time series across all dimensions in both axes using the SAX representation, before applying tokenization"
- Break condition: If the quantization process loses critical information needed for accurate forecasting, performance will degrade despite computational benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot prompting allows LLMs to perform multivariate forecasting without fine-tuning, leveraging their pre-trained knowledge.
- Mechanism: The LLM uses its pre-existing language understanding capabilities to interpret the multiplexed and quantized time series input and generate future values through pattern recognition.
- Core assumption: LLMs trained on diverse text data have sufficient emergent abilities to handle time series patterns when properly encoded as text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "zero-shot LLM-based approach for multivariate time series forecasting"
  - [section] "we examine the utility of LLMs for multivariate time series forecasting via zero-shot prompting"
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks emergent abilities for pattern recognition in time series data, zero-shot performance will be inadequate.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals
  - Why needed here: Understanding these components helps in designing multiplexing strategies that preserve important patterns
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how each component would be affected by digit-interleaving versus value-interleaving?

- Concept: Symbolic representation and discretization techniques
  - Why needed here: SAX quantization is a specific form of symbolic representation that needs to be understood for proper implementation
  - Quick check question: How does changing the alphabet size in SAX affect the granularity of pattern preservation?

- Concept: LLM tokenization and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The success of the approach depends on how well the time series tokens are processed by the LLM tokenizer
  - Quick check question: What considerations must be made when adapting the tokenizer for numerical time series data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing pipeline (rescaling, multiplexing, quantization) -> LLM inference engine (with custom tokenizer if needed) -> Post-processing pipeline (demultiplexing, descaling) -> Evaluation module (RMSE calculation, comparison with baselines)

- Critical path: 1. Input time series data → preprocessing (rescaling) 2. Dimensional multiplexing → SAX quantization 3. LLM inference → output generation 4. Post-processing (demultiplexing, descaling) → final forecast 5. Evaluation against ground truth

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. computational cost: SAX quantization reduces cost but may decrease accuracy
  - Multiplexing technique choice: Different techniques work better for different dataset characteristics
  - LLM selection: Larger models may perform better but increase cost and inference time

- Failure signatures:
  - High RMSE with correct data preprocessing suggests multiplexing/demultiplexing issues
  - Dramatically reduced execution time with poor accuracy indicates quantization loss
  - Inconsistent performance across dimensions suggests multiplexing technique mismatch

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare all three multiplexing techniques (DI, VI, VC) on a simple 2D dataset without SAX quantization
  2. Apply SAX quantization with varying segment lengths and alphabet sizes to the best-performing multiplexing technique
  3. Test zero-shot performance against fine-tuned LSTM baseline on the same datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does MultiCast's performance scale with increasing dimensionality beyond the tested datasets?
- Which dataset characteristics cause certain MultiCast variants to perform better than others?
- Does MultiCast's performance improve significantly when using larger LLMs like GPT-4 or Gemini compared to LLaMA2?

## Limitations
- The paper only tests MultiCast on three datasets with up to 4 dimensions, limiting generalizability
- The approach relies heavily on LLM capabilities without characterizing minimum model size requirements
- The paper lacks systematic sensitivity analysis for SAX quantization parameters across different datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core claim that token multiplexing enables LLM processing of multivariate time series data is well-supported by the methodology description and experimental results showing improved execution times.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim about SAX quantization maintaining forecasting accuracy while reducing computational costs is supported by results but lacks comprehensive parameter sensitivity analysis.

**Medium Confidence**: The competitive forecasting accuracy claim relative to baselines is demonstrated but limited by the small number of comparison datasets and the absence of statistical significance testing.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic experiments varying SAX quantization parameters (segment lengths from 2-10, alphabet sizes from 3-10) across all three datasets to identify optimal configurations and characterize performance degradation thresholds.

2. Test the approach across multiple LLM sizes (7B, 13B, 34B parameters) to determine the minimum effective model size and characterize how performance scales with model capacity, particularly for demultiplexing capability.

3. Perform statistical significance tests (paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank) comparing MultiCast against each baseline method across multiple runs to establish whether observed performance differences are statistically significant rather than due to random variation.
