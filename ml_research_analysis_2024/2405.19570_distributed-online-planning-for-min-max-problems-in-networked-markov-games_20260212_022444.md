# Distributed Online Planning for Min-Max Problems in Networked Markov Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19570
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19570
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Achieves ϵ-suboptimal configuration with worst agent cumulative reward of -1188 vs -2338 for POMCPOW baseline in formation control

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a distributed online planning algorithm for solving min-max problems in networked Markov games, where the objective is to maximize the worst-performing agent's expected cumulative reward. The method combines online planning to approximate local return functions with distributed optimization to determine optimal immediate actions for each agent. The algorithm operates in two phases: first creating convex function approximations of local expected cumulative costs through online planning, then solving the min-max problem using distributed optimization. The approach is demonstrated on a formation control problem, showing superior performance compared to baseline methods while achieving results comparable to the optimal action sequence.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm addresses min-max problems in networked Markov games by leveraging distributed online planning. It begins with an online planning phase where each agent approximates its local return function using planning techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search. These approximations are then used in a distributed optimization framework that solves the min-max problem to determine each agent's immediate action. The method operates in a receding horizon fashion, continuously replanning as the system evolves. The distributed nature allows agents to make decisions based on local information while accounting for the interconnected nature of the networked system through the optimization process.

## Key Results
- Achieves ϵ-suboptimal configuration with worst agent cumulative reward of -1188
- Outperforms POMCPOW baseline with -2338 worst agent cumulative reward
- Demonstrates performance comparable to optimal action sequence in formation control problem

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by decomposing the global min-max optimization problem into local planning and distributed optimization components. Online planning creates accurate approximations of local return functions that capture each agent's expected performance, while the distributed optimization framework ensures these local decisions collectively optimize the global worst-case objective. This decomposition allows for scalable computation while maintaining solution quality.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Markov Games** - Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where multiple agents interact in a shared environment. Needed to understand the problem setting and how agents' actions affect each other's rewards.

2. **Convex Function Approximation** - Technique for approximating complex functions with convex ones. Required to create tractable representations of local return functions for distributed optimization.

3. **Distributed Optimization** - Methods for solving optimization problems across multiple computing nodes. Essential for the algorithm's ability to compute solutions without centralized coordination.

4. **Online Planning** - Decision-making approach that plans in real-time rather than using pre-computed policies. Critical for adapting to the current state of the networked system.

5. **Min-Max Optimization** - Optimization framework that maximizes the minimum objective value. Core to the problem formulation of maximizing the worst-performing agent's reward.

6. **Receding Horizon Control** - Control strategy that repeatedly solves optimization problems over a moving time window. Underlies the algorithm's iterative replanning approach.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Online Planning -> Local Function Approximation -> Distributed Optimization -> Action Selection -> System Update

Critical path: The algorithm follows a receding horizon approach where each iteration consists of online planning to generate function approximations, distributed optimization to compute actions, and system execution. This cycle repeats continuously.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades off between computational complexity (through distributed optimization) and solution quality (through online planning approximations). More planning iterations improve function approximations but increase computation time.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation occurs when local function approximations are inaccurate, distributed optimization fails to converge, or communication constraints prevent effective coordination. These manifest as suboptimal worst-agent performance.

First experiments:
1. Verify online planning generates convex approximations by testing on simple known functions
2. Test distributed optimization convergence on small networks with known optimal solutions
3. Validate end-to-end performance on a 2-agent formation control problem with ground truth optimal solution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to Markov games with different reward structures or network topologies remains uncertain
- Convergence guarantees for online planning phase under varying communication constraints are not established
- Computational complexity for distributed optimization step in larger networks is not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

High: The algorithm's core framework and formation control application are well-described and experimentally validated. Comparison against POMCPOW baseline and achievement of ϵ-suboptimal performance are supported by results.

Medium: Claims regarding adaptability to different Markov game scenarios and performance under varying communication constraints require further investigation with diverse problem instances.

Low: Scalability analysis and computational complexity bounds for larger networks are not sufficiently detailed, making practical applicability assessment difficult.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate algorithm performance on Markov games with different reward structures and network topologies to assess generalizability
2. Conduct experiments with varying levels of communication constraints to analyze impact on convergence and performance
3. Perform thorough scalability analysis by testing on larger networks and measuring computational complexity of distributed optimization step
