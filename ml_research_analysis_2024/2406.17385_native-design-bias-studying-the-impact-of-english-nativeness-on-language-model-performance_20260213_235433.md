# Native Design Bias: Studying the Impact of English Nativeness on Language Model Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17385
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs show performance bias favoring Western native English speakers, with non-Western natives and non-natives performing similarly; informing models about nativeness degrades non-native performance through anchoring effects.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether Large Language Models exhibit bias based on English nativeness across three speaker groups: Western natives, non-Western natives, and non-natives. Using over 12,000 prompts from 124 annotators across 10 NLP datasets, the researchers compared model performance on classification (both objective and subjective) and generation tasks. Results reveal significant performance disparities tied to speaker nativeness, with Western natives performing best on objective tasks while subjective classification shows unexpected patterns where Western natives receive lower intended scores. The study also uncovers a strong anchoring effect where informing models about a user's nativeness—regardless of accuracy—degrades performance for non-native speakers.

## Method Summary
The researchers collected prompts from 124 annotators across Western native, non-Western native, and non-native English speaker groups, validating and standardizing them for 10 diverse NLP tasks. They generated LLM responses using GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Claude Haiku/Sonnet, and Qwen1.5-7B models, both with and without explicit nativeness cues. Performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics for classification tasks and LLM-as-a-judge (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) for generation tasks, measuring fluency, coherence, and relevance. The study compared performance across speaker groups and tested the anchoring effect by providing correct and incorrect nativeness information to the models.

## Key Results
- Western native speakers achieve highest performance on objective classification tasks, with non-Western natives and non-natives performing similarly
- Subjective classification tasks show unexpected results where Western native responses receive lower intended scores than generated
- Generative tasks demonstrate greater robustness to native bias, likely due to longer context length and generation optimization
- Anchoring effect is strong and consistent: informing models about nativeness degrades non-native performance regardless of cue accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs exhibit bias favoring Western native English speakers over non-Western natives and non-natives in objective classification tasks.
- Mechanism: Training corpora are over-represented with Western privileged dialects, leading to learned embeddings that correlate performance with linguistic proximity to these dialects.
- Core assumption: Dialectal differences in prompt phrasing affect feature extraction and classification accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "results show that LLMs perform best for Western native speakers on objective classification tasks, with non-Western natives and non-natives performing similarly."
  - [section] "We find an interesting overall preference towards the WN group, where the NWN group is performing similarly as the NN group."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct neighbor paper addresses Western vs non-Western native bias specifically.
- Break condition: If dialectal differences are neutralized by prompt standardization or multilingual training data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Informing the model about a user's nativeness causes an anchoring effect that degrades performance for non-native speakers.
- Mechanism: The model overweights the provided nativeness cue, altering its internal reasoning path and causing suboptimal responses, even when the cue is incorrect.
- Core assumption: LLMs treat explicit user attributes as strong priors that shift response generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "informing models about a user's nativeness—regardless of correctness—degrades performance for non-native speakers in objective tasks."
  - [section] "we uncover deeply embedded bias within models towards native speakers for the classification tasks, as explicitly stating that a prompt writer is non-native leads to lower model performance compared to stating that the writer is native regardless of the correctness of this information."
  - [corpus] "Non-native speakers of English or ChatGPT: Who thinks better?" suggests performance differences, but not anchoring effects specifically.
- Break condition: If the model's instruction-following layer overrides or filters out explicit nativeness cues.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Generative tasks are more robust to nativeness bias than classification tasks.
- Mechanism: Longer context length in generative tasks and optimization for open-ended generation reduce sensitivity to prompt dialectal variations.
- Core assumption: Extended context dilutes the impact of initial dialectal cues and shifts model focus to overall coherence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Generative tasks show greater robustness to native bias, likely due to longer context length and optimization for generation."
  - [section] "we find that generation tasks are rather robust against (Western) native bias."
  - [corpus] No direct neighbor evidence; this is inferred from the paper's internal analysis.
- Break condition: If task complexity or domain-specific terminology overrides context length benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cognitive anchoring bias in human decision-making.
  - Why needed here: The study explicitly maps LLM behavior to the cognitive bias of anchoring, requiring understanding of how prior information influences judgment.
  - Quick check question: If told a person is a non-native speaker, will an LLM's accuracy drop even if the statement is false? (Answer: Yes, per anchoring effect.)

- Concept: Dialectal variation in English.
  - Why needed here: Performance differences hinge on dialectal proximity to training data, so recognizing what constitutes dialectal vs proficiency differences is critical.
  - Quick check question: Is "People can't be eaten" equivalent to "It is physically impossible to eat people" in meaning? (Answer: Yes, but models may treat them differently.)

- Concept: Instruction-following in LLMs.
  - Why needed here: The study manipulates explicit instructions about nativeness, so understanding how LLMs parse and prioritize such instructions is essential.
  - Quick check question: Will an LLM prioritize a new instruction about user nativeness over the original task prompt? (Answer: Often, leading to anchoring effects.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection pipeline -> Annotator interface -> Validation layer -> Prompt generation -> Model API -> LLM-as-a-judge evaluation -> Analysis scripts
- Critical path: Annotator quality -> Prompt consistency -> Model response retrieval -> Evaluation scoring -> Statistical analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Open annotation vs platform standardization -> Balancing annotator diversity with consistency; LLM-as-a-judge vs human annotation -> Trade-off between scalability and nuance capture
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent annotations -> Low validation rates; Model API failures -> Missing or malformed responses; LLM-as-a-judge bias -> Corrupted evaluation scores
- First 3 experiments: 1) Run classification tasks without nativeness cues across all three speaker groups; 2) Add correct nativeness cues and measure performance shifts; 3) Add incorrect nativeness cues and compare with correct cue results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the performance differences between native and non-native English speakers persist across different model families beyond those tested, particularly for models developed in non-Western countries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that Qwen, developed by Chinese researchers, shows minimal Western native preference, suggesting model development origin may influence native bias.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested five models across three families. Limited cross-cultural model diversity means broader trends remain unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing a larger and more diverse set of models from different geographic and cultural development origins across multiple tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the observed native bias affect downstream applications that rely on LLM outputs, such as educational tools, customer service, or information retrieval for non-native speakers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses allocational and representational harms but does not quantify real-world impact on practical LLM applications.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on controlled experimental tasks without examining real-world usage scenarios where native bias could materially disadvantage users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring user outcomes, satisfaction, and task completion rates for native versus non-native speakers in deployed LLM systems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific linguistic features in non-native prompts cause the most significant performance degradation, and can these be systematically mitigated through prompt engineering or model training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Manual analysis revealed that ambiguities in non-native phrasing, such as less fluent constructions, led to misclassification, but did not identify precise linguistic markers.
- Why unresolved: The paper identified the problem but did not perform detailed linguistic feature analysis or test targeted interventions to reduce bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed linguistic analysis of error patterns combined with experiments testing prompt rewrites or targeted fine-tuning on non-native dialects.

## Limitations
- Anchoring effect mechanism remains incompletely explained - unclear whether models are truly "anchoring" or over-interpreting explicit user attributes
- Western vs non-Western native distinction relies on self-reported geography which may not capture dialectal nuances accurately
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation introduces potential circularity, as the same models being tested may have inherent biases affecting their evaluation of other outputs

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Objective classification performance differences favoring Western natives (supported by clear statistical evidence across multiple models and tasks)
- **Medium confidence**: Anchoring effect mechanism and its consistency across models (well-documented but mechanistically incomplete)
- **Medium confidence**: Generative task robustness (supported by data but lacks direct causal evidence for the context-length explanation)
- **Low confidence**: Western vs non-Western native performance differences in subjective classification (results show inconsistency across models and the evaluation mechanism is unclear)

## Next Checks
1. **Mechanism isolation test**: Replicate the anchoring effect using synthetic prompts with controlled dialectal features to determine whether models are responding to dialectal proximity versus other cue properties.

2. **Human evaluation validation**: Have human annotators evaluate the same model outputs to validate whether LLM-as-a-judge scores accurately capture native bias versus other quality factors.

3. **Proficiency-stratified analysis**: Re-analyze performance differences within non-native speaker groups by English proficiency levels to determine whether proficiency or nativeness is the primary driver of observed effects.
