# Image Textualization: An Automatic Framework for Creating Accurate and Detailed Image Descriptions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.07502
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07502
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: IT framework generates image descriptions that outperform MLLM-only outputs across multiple benchmarks with BLEU-1 improving from 12.90 to 25.71

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Image Textualization (IT), a three-phase framework that automatically generates detailed image descriptions by combining multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), vision expert models, and large language models (LLMs). The framework addresses the limitations of existing image description datasets, which often suffer from low quality, noise, and lack of detail. IT operates through holistic textualization using MLLMs, visual detail textualization using vision experts to extract fine-grained information and detect hallucinations, and textualized recaptioning using LLMs to produce accurate and detailed descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that IT-generated descriptions significantly outperform MLLM-generated ones across various metrics, and MLLMs fine-tuned with IT-curated descriptions show enhanced capability to generate richer image descriptions with less hallucination.

## Method Summary
The Image Textualization framework operates in three phases: (1) Holistic Textualization using MLLMs to generate reference descriptions, (2) Visual Detail Textualization using vision experts (object detection, dense captioning, segmentation, depth estimation) to extract fine-grained object information and detect hallucinations by cross-checking reference entities against detected objects, and (3) Textualized Recaptioning using LLMs to generate final detailed descriptions based on the reference description and textualized object information. The framework leverages monocular depth estimation combined with segmentation masks to enrich 2D bounding boxes with depth information, and uses dense captioning to provide attribute-rich object descriptions. Experiments show that IT-generated descriptions significantly improve BLEU and CIDEr scores compared to MLLM-only outputs, and MLLMs fine-tuned with IT-curated descriptions generate richer descriptions with reduced hallucination.

## Key Results
- BLEU-1 scores improved from 12.90 to 25.71 on DID-Bench
- CIDEr scores improved from 0.00 to 2.34 on DID-Bench
- MLLMs fine-tuned with IT-curated descriptions showed enhanced capability to generate richer image descriptions with less hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Multi-phase pipeline mitigates MLLM hallucinations by decoupling perception from generation
- **Mechanism**: MLLMs provide holistic templates, vision experts inject fine-grained object-level annotations, LLMs reconstruct descriptions without direct image access to avoid inheriting hallucination patterns
- **Core assumption**: Hallucinations are mainly MLLM-specific and can be identified via cross-checking with vision expert detections
- **Evidence anchors**: 
  - [abstract]: "To address the shortcomings of existing image description datasets, recent advancements in MLLMs have shown remarkable potential for generating descriptions. However, MLLMs possess several weaknesses, such as the well known visual hallucination problem"
  - [section 3.2.1]: "To identify hallucinations existed in the reference description, we first extract object entities... utilize an open-set object detector... to verify each of these extracted entity phrases against objects in the image"
- **Break condition**: If vision expert detections are noisy or incomplete, hallucination filtering will be unreliable

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: 3D spatial enrichment via monocular depth estimation improves description completeness
- **Mechanism**: Depth maps combined with segmentation masks transform 2D bounding boxes into depth-aware spatial context, enabling LLMs to reason about foreground/background relationships
- **Core assumption**: Relative depth cues are sufficient for LLMs to infer spatial arrangements without explicit 3D geometry
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.2.2]: "The most critical reasons for this is that the current textualization can only convey the relative left-right relationships of objects on a 2D plane... The current textualization fails to capture the 3D spatial context, such as depth"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "We derive this depth information by first obtaining a distance map using a monocular depth prediction model... Finally, the object depth is obtained by averaging the depth values within its corresponding segmentation mask"
- **Break condition**: If depth estimation is inaccurate, spatial descriptions will mislead the LLM

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Fine-grained dense captioning supplies richer object attributes than object detection alone
- **Mechanism**: Dense captioning provides attribute-rich descriptions (e.g., "grey and white cat") instead of mere categories, feeding more descriptive tokens to the LLM
- **Core assumption**: Attribute-rich tokens improve the LLM's ability to reconstruct accurate, detailed descriptions
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.2.2]: "Dense Caption Generation... DC provides a more detailed description such as 'a grey and white cat'; compared with conventional captioning models that only predicts image-level captions, DC is able to predict descriptions for all the visible objects"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "These appealing properties make DC a suitable choice for maximizing the textualization of objects’ information, which is beneficial for the subsequent recaptioning phase"
- **Break condition**: If dense captioning model fails on rare objects, description richness will suffer

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Hallucination detection via cross-modal verification
  - **Why needed here**: Ensures that hallucinated entities from MLLM are filtered before LLM reconstruction
  - **Quick check question**: How does the system decide whether a phrase is hallucinated? (Answer: open-set object detector checks if phrase maps to any detected object)
- **Concept**: Spatial encoding from depth maps
  - **Why needed here**: Converts 2D bounding boxes into 3D-aware spatial context for accurate relative positioning
  - **Quick check question**: What format is depth information normalized to before feeding to LLM? (Answer: relative values normalized across the image)
- **Concept**: Fine-grained attribute extraction
  - **Why needed here**: Supplies richer descriptive tokens than coarse categories, improving LLM output detail
  - **Quick check question**: What extra information does dense captioning provide beyond detection? (Answer: object attributes like color, shape, texture)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Image → MLLM → Hallucination detection → Vision experts (object detection + dense captioning + depth estimation + segmentation) → LLM
- **Critical path**: MLLM → Hallucination detection → Vision experts → LLM
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using multiple vision experts increases accuracy but adds latency; monocular depth estimation is lightweight but less precise than stereo
- **Failure signatures**: If any vision expert fails, downstream LLM recaptioning may omit objects or misplace them; hallucination detection false negatives cause incorrect descriptions
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate hallucination detection: Feed known hallucinated phrases and check if open-set detector flags them
  2. Test depth enrichment: Compare spatial accuracy with/without depth info in LLM prompt
  3. Benchmark dense captioning vs detection-only: Measure attribute richness and coverage difference

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How would the Image Textualization framework perform when applied to larger multimodal large language models like LLaVA-70B, and would it achieve similar or better performance compared to LLaVA-7B?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors mention that they did not tune larger multimodal large language models due to computational limitations, but they expect IT to achieve similar or even better performance on larger models due to their stronger generalization ability and robustness to forgetting.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper did not conduct experiments with larger models, so there is no empirical evidence to support the claim.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with larger models like LLaVA-70B using the IT framework and comparing the results with the performance of LLaVA-7B.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How would the Image Textualization framework perform on different types of images, such as images with complex scenes, abstract art, or images with multiple objects of the same category?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper focuses on generating detailed descriptions for general images, but it does not explicitly mention how the framework would handle images with specific characteristics like complex scenes or abstract art.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide experiments or results for these specific types of images, so the framework's performance in these cases is unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with images of various types, including complex scenes, abstract art, and images with multiple objects of the same category, and evaluating the quality of the generated descriptions.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How would the Image Textualization framework perform when applied to languages other than English, and would it require significant modifications or additional training data?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper does not mention the language used for the generated descriptions or discuss the framework's applicability to other languages.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide any information about the framework's performance on non-English languages, so its effectiveness in this aspect is unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with the IT framework on non-English languages and evaluating the quality of the generated descriptions. Additionally, investigating the necessary modifications or additional training data required for effective performance in other languages.

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on the accuracy of multiple vision expert models, creating potential failure cascades if any component performs poorly
- Hallucination detection assumes open-set object detectors can reliably identify hallucinated entities, which may not hold for complex or ambiguous scenes
- Quality of final descriptions depends on LLM's ability to effectively integrate and reason over textualized multi-modal inputs

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The three-phase architecture design and general workflow are clearly specified and logically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The hallucination detection mechanism is well-defined, but its effectiveness depends on vision expert performance
- **Medium Confidence**: The depth enrichment approach is theoretically sound, but practical impact needs empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: Specific model versions and detailed prompt templates used are not explicitly stated, requiring researcher judgment for implementation

## Next Checks
1. **Hallucination Detection Validation**: Create a test set with known hallucinated descriptions and measure the open-set detector's precision/recall in identifying hallucinated entities
2. **Depth Enrichment Impact**: Generate descriptions with and without depth information using identical images and compare spatial accuracy metrics
3. **Vision Expert Robustness**: Test the framework on images with known challenging properties (occlusions, rare objects, complex backgrounds) to identify failure modes in vision expert components
