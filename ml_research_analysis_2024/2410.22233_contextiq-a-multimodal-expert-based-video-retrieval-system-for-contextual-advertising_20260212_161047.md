# ContextIQ: A Multimodal Expert-Based Video Retrieval System for Contextual Advertising

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: Expert-based multimodal system achieves 96.6% precision@1 on Condensed Movies without joint training

## Executive Summary
ContextIQ is a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed for contextual advertising that leverages specialized models across video, audio, captions, and metadata to create semantically rich video representations without joint training. The system achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art jointly trained models on multiple benchmarks while maintaining modularity for real-time ad serving and implementing robust brand safety filters. ContextIQ's architecture processes long-form content offline and enables efficient real-time retrieval through modality-specific expert models that extract complementary information from video frames, audio segments, captions, and metadata.

## Method Summary
ContextIQ employs a modular expert-based architecture that uses separate, specialized models for different modalities (video, audio, captions, metadata) without joint training. The system extracts rich semantic features from each modality using domain-specific encoders (BLIP2 for video, CLAP for audio, MPNet for captions, YOLOv5 and ResNet50 for metadata) and aggregates them through a similarity computation and reweighting module. This approach achieves competitive retrieval performance while enabling flexible adaptation to brand-specific needs and maintaining real-time ad serving capabilities through efficient offline processing of long-form content.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96.6% precision@1 on Condensed Movies benchmark without joint training
- Matches or outperforms state-of-the-art jointly trained models across multiple benchmarks
- Achieves 100% precision@5 on curated high-production content dataset
- Ablation studies show significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and coverage with multi-modal integration over vision-only approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Expert models without joint training yield competitive performance to joint multimodal models
- **Core assumption:** Modalities contain complementary information that improves retrieval accuracy when combined
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models; ablation studies highlight benefits of leveraging multiple modalities
- **Break condition:** If modalities are highly redundant or expert models are poorly aligned, aggregation may not improve performance

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Modularity enables flexible adaptation to brand-specific needs
- **Core assumption:** Different campaigns require different granularities of video understanding
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions flexible design for brand targeting; example given for beauty brand with advanced object detection
- **Break condition:** If maintenance costs exceed flexibility benefits or real-time requirements make updates impractical

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Brand safety filters ensure appropriate ad placement
- **Core assumption:** Advertisers need content filtering beyond simple keyword matching
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions brand safety filters for contextually appropriate content; section emphasizes importance of brand safety
- **Break condition:** If detection models produce high false positives, reducing ad inventory

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Modality-specific feature extraction and aggregation
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how expert models in different modalities can be combined to create richer video representations
  - **Quick check question:** How does the aggregation module combine similarity scores from different modalities, and what role do normalization and thresholding play?

- **Concept:** Text-to-video retrieval as a multimodal learning problem
  - **Why needed here:** System maps text queries to video segments using embeddings from multiple modalities
  - **Quick check question:** What are the differences between embedding generation processes for video frames, audio segments, and metadata?

- **Concept:** Brand safety mechanisms in content moderation
  - **Why needed here:** System implements filters for profanity, hate speech, and emotion detection
  - **Quick check question:** How do hate speech detection models (LLM and BERT ensemble) combine predictions, and what threshold values are used?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Metadata Extraction Module -> Multimodal Encoders -> Embeddings Database -> Multimodal Search Pipeline
- **Critical path:** Video processing → Metadata extraction → Embedding generation → Text query encoding → Similarity computation → Aggregation and filtering → Result ranking
- **Design tradeoffs:** Expert models vs joint training (avoid large-scale dataset requirements but need careful aggregation); Fixed vs adaptive thresholds (simplify implementation vs generalization); Real-time vs offline processing (efficient retrieval vs comprehensive analysis)
- **Failure signatures:** Low precision (poorly aligned expert models or redundant modalities); High false positives in brand safety (overly sensitive detection thresholds); Slow retrieval (improper indexing or expensive aggregation)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Modality ablation test: Run retrieval with vision-only, then add audio, then captions, then metadata to measure precision improvements
  2. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Vary normalization weights and similarity thresholds to find optimal settings
  3. Brand safety filter evaluation: Test hate speech and profanity detection models on labeled dataset to measure precision/recall

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends on carefully tuned normalization weights and thresholds that may not generalize across different content domains
- Real-world effectiveness in contextual advertising scenarios remains uncertain without extensive A/B testing in live ad-serving environments
- Proprietary internal datasets (Val-1 and Val-2) used for evaluation are not publicly available, limiting independent verification

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core architecture (expert models + aggregation) is technically sound and ablation studies are well-supported
- **Medium confidence:** Claim of competitive performance relative to joint training models requires broader domain testing
- **Medium confidence:** Brand safety filtering effectiveness is plausible but real-world false positive/negative rates are not quantified

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain performance validation: Test system on diverse video datasets to verify 96.6% precision@1 result generalizes beyond Condensed Movies
2. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary normalization weights and similarity thresholds to determine robustness and identify optimal settings for different advertising verticals
3. Brand safety real-world testing: Deploy profanity, hate speech, and emotion detection filters on diverse sample of actual video content to measure false positive/negative rates and evaluate impact on ad inventory availability
