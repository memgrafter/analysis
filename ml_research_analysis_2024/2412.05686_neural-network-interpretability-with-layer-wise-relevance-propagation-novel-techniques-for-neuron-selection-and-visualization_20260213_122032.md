# Neural network interpretability with layer-wise relevance propagation: novel techniques for neuron selection and visualization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05686
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05686
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Novel approach improves neural network interpretability using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) with VGG16 architecture through optimized neuron selection and visualization techniques

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance neural network interpretability using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). The authors propose techniques to optimize neuron selection during LRP backward propagation, specifically targeting the VGG16 architecture. Their method generates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and employs both relevance-based and activation-based heatmaps for visualization. The approach also incorporates deconvolutional visualization to reconstruct feature maps, providing comprehensive insights into the network's inner workings. Experimental results demonstrate improved interpretability and support for developing more transparent AI systems in computer vision applications.

## Method Summary
The method implements LRP to compute relevance scores, generating neural network graphs that highlight critical paths based on these scores. Neuron selection is optimized using the GetOptimizer algorithm, which filters neurons based on contribution thresholds defined by mean and standard deviation. Visualization includes both relevance-based and activation-based heatmaps, along with deconvolutional reconstruction of feature maps. The approach is evaluated using accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) to assess both path selection and overall interpretability.

## Key Results
- The proposed method successfully identifies significant neuron paths in VGG16 through optimized selection algorithms
- Combined relevance-based and activation-based heatmaps provide complementary views of neuron importance
- Deconvolutional visualization effectively reconstructs feature maps, revealing spatial regions that most influence predictions
- The approach enhances interpretability and supports the development of transparent AI systems for computer vision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method improves interpretability by isolating and highlighting the most relevant neurons in the backward propagation phase using optimized path selection algorithms.
- Mechanism: The GetOptimizer algorithm computes the difference between forward and backward pass results, retaining neurons whose contributions exceed a threshold defined by the mean minus one standard deviation.
- Core assumption: The difference between forward and backward results accurately reflects the contribution of each neuron to the prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method creates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with heatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)."
  - [section] "Algorithm 1, GetOptimizer, is central to our approach for optimizing the path selection in NNs. The algorithm begins by taking the forward and backward pass results of a NN and an index as inputs."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers mention LRP optimization but do not describe the specific threshold-based neuron selection approach used here.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deconvolutional visualization reconstructs feature maps to show how selected neurons contribute to the final prediction in image space.
- Mechanism: The algorithm sets all activations to zero except the selected neuron, then applies unpooling and deconvolution operations to reconstruct features in image space.
- Core assumption: The deconvolution process accurately reverses the pooling and convolution operations to reconstruct meaningful feature representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, we utilize a deconvolutional visualization technique to reconstruct feature maps, offering a comprehensive view of the network's inner workings."
  - [section] "Algorithm 2, Feature Map Reconstruction, reconstructs images by reversing pooling and convolution operations, allowing for the visualization of specific neuron contributions to the classification process."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while deconvolution is mentioned in related work, the specific application to LRP relevance visualization is not well-supported in the corpus.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of relevance-based and activation-based heatmaps provides complementary views of neuron importance, enhancing overall interpretability.
- Mechanism: Relevance-based heatmaps highlight areas with high LRP scores, while activation-based heatmaps show regions with strong neuron responses.
- Core assumption: Both relevance scores and activation patterns provide valid and complementary information about neuron importance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method creates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with heatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)."
  - [section] "To further interpret the network's decisions, heatmaps are generated based on the selected paths... He applies LRP to the VGG16 model to derive relevance scores for each neuron."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - the corpus mentions LRP heatmaps but does not discuss combining relevance and activation-based approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LRP propagates relevance scores backward through the network is essential for grasping how the proposed method identifies important neurons
  - Quick check question: What property ensures that the total relevance at the output layer equals the sum of relevance values at the input layer in LRP?

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically VGG16
  - Why needed here: The method is applied to VGG16, so understanding its 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers is necessary to follow the path selection and visualization processes
  - Quick check question: How many parameters does the VGG16 architecture approximately have, and what is its top-5 accuracy on ImageNet?

- Concept: Visualization techniques (heatmaps, feature map reconstruction)
  - Why needed here: The proposed approach relies heavily on generating and interpreting heatmaps and reconstructed feature maps to demonstrate interpretability
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between relevance-based and activation-based heatmaps in terms of what they reveal about neural network decisions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image -> VGG16 forward pass -> LRP backward computation -> GetOptimizer algorithm -> Path selection -> Heatmap generation -> Deconvolutional reconstruction -> MSE/SMAPE evaluation

- Critical path: 1. Forward pass through VGG16 to obtain activations 2. Backward LRP computation to obtain relevance scores 3. GetOptimizer algorithm to select k most relevant paths 4. Heatmap visualization of selected paths 5. Deconvolutional reconstruction of feature maps for selected neurons 6. Evaluation using MSE and SMAPE metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. interpretability: More complex visualization (relevance + activation) provides better understanding but requires more computation
  - Number of paths (k): Higher k values show more detail but may overwhelm interpretation; lower k values simplify but might miss important information
  - Threshold selection: Stricter thresholds (fewer neurons) improve clarity but risk missing subtle contributions; looser thresholds capture more but reduce interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Heatmaps show uniform relevance across the entire image (threshold too loose)
  - Selected paths do not correspond to semantically meaningful image regions (path selection algorithm flawed)
  - Reconstructed feature maps are noisy or unclear (deconvolution implementation issues)
  - MSE and SMAPE values are high despite good visualization (model performance issues masked by visualization)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the full pipeline on a simple binary classification task with a small CNN to verify each component works independently
  2. Test the GetOptimizer algorithm with synthetic forward/backward results to ensure it correctly identifies high-contribution neurons
  3. Apply the visualization to VGG16 on a small subset of ImageNet (e.g., 10 animal classes) to check that heatmaps align with human intuition about important features

## Limitations
- The specific implementation details of the GetOptimizer algorithm and deconvolution pipeline remain unclear, making faithful reproduction challenging
- Evaluation focuses primarily on visualization quality rather than downstream task performance, leaving questions about practical utility unanswered
- The approach is only validated on VGG16 architecture, limiting understanding of its generalizability to other network types

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in the relevance-based neuron selection mechanism, as the theoretical framework is sound but the specific implementation details are unclear
- Low confidence in the deconvolution visualization claims, given the weak evidence for this specific application in the corpus and lack of implementation details
- Medium confidence in the combined heatmap approach, as relevance and activation visualization are established techniques, though their specific integration here is novel

## Next Checks
1. Implement the GetOptimizer algorithm with synthetic forward/backward pass results to verify the threshold-based neuron selection correctly identifies high-contribution neurons
2. Test the deconvolution pipeline on a simple convolutional network with known activations to confirm accurate feature map reconstruction
3. Conduct a user study comparing the proposed visualization method against standard LRP heatmaps to assess whether the combined approach meaningfully improves interpretability for human observers
