core_contribution: MORE addresses the challenge of enhancing commonsense reasoning
  in language models by introducing a multi-modal retrieval augmentation framework
  that leverages both text and images as supplementary information sources. The method
  employs a plug-and-play integrator with a cross-attention mechanism to extract and
  weigh useful information from retrieved multi-modal results, while a training strategy
  incorporating query dropout and noisy retrieval input ensures the model learns to
  effectively utilize and critically evaluate the retrieved content.

# MORE: Multi-mOdal REtrieval Augmented Generative Commonsense Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13625
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13625
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: MORE significantly improves commonsense reasoning performance on CommonGen task with SPICE scores up to 32.81, outperforming GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 baselines

## Executive Summary
MORE introduces a novel framework for enhancing commonsense reasoning in language models through multi-modal retrieval augmentation. The approach combines text and image retrieval with a sophisticated integration mechanism that allows language models to effectively utilize retrieved information. By employing a cross-attention mechanism and specialized training strategies, MORE addresses the limitations of traditional language models in commonsense reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The MORE framework consists of a retriever, a plug-and-play integrator, and a generator. The retriever gathers relevant text and images based on the input query, while the integrator uses a cross-attention mechanism to extract and weigh useful information from the retrieved content. A unique training strategy incorporating query dropout and noisy retrieval input ensures the model learns to effectively utilize and critically evaluate retrieved information. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing it to be applied to various backbone language models.

## Key Results
- Achieves SPICE scores up to 32.81 on the CommonGen task, outperforming GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- Demonstrates significant improvements across various backbone models, including both single-modal and multi-modal LMs
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in commonsense reasoning performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MORE works by effectively bridging the gap between retrieval augmentation and generative commonsense reasoning. The cross-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of retrieved text and images, while the training strategy with query dropout and noisy inputs ensures robust learning. The multi-modal approach captures complementary information that single-modal retrieval might miss, leading to more comprehensive understanding and better reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed - to provide additional context beyond the model's training data. Quick check - verify that retrieved information is relevant and improves generation quality.

**Cross-Attention Mechanisms**: Why needed - to effectively integrate information from multiple sources. Quick check - ensure the model can properly weigh and combine information from text and images.

**Commonsense Reasoning**: Why needed - to evaluate the model's ability to make logical inferences beyond explicit information. Quick check - test on diverse commonsense reasoning tasks beyond CommonGen.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Retriever -> Integrator (Cross-Attention) -> Generator

Critical Path: Query -> Retriever -> Retrieved Content -> Integrator (with Cross-Attention) -> Augmented Input -> Generator -> Output

Design Tradeoffs: The model balances between the richness of retrieved information and computational efficiency. More extensive retrieval might improve performance but increase latency and computational costs.

Failure Signatures: Poor retrieval quality, ineffective integration of multi-modal information, or over-reliance on retrieved content can lead to degraded performance.

First Experiments:
1. Test with single-modal retrieval (text-only) to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate with different backbone models to verify model-agnostic effectiveness
3. Conduct ablation studies on the cross-attention mechanism to quantify its impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting its solution and results.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on the CommonGen task, limiting generalizability assessment
- Scalability to more complex reasoning tasks or diverse domains remains untested
- Potential computational overhead and bottlenecks related to multi-modal retrieval are not thoroughly explored

## Confidence

High confidence in the effectiveness of MORE for improving commonsense reasoning on the CommonGen task, as evidenced by significant SPICE score improvements and outperformance of established baselines.

Medium confidence in the generalizability of improvements across other commonsense reasoning tasks, given the limited evaluation scope.

Low confidence in claims about the model's robustness and scalability, as these aspects are not explicitly addressed or validated in the study.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the MORE framework on additional commonsense reasoning benchmarks beyond CommonGen to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct stress tests with noisy or incomplete multi-modal inputs to measure robustness.

3. Benchmark the computational efficiency and scalability of the retrieval-augmented approach in real-world applications with larger datasets.
