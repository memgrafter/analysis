# Active Learning for Fair and Stable Online Allocations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14784
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14784
- Authors: Riddhiman Bhattacharya; Thanh Nguyen; Will Wei Sun; Mohit Tawarmalani
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper develops an active learning framework for online fair and stable resource allocation problems using a dueling upper-lower confidence bound (ULCB) approach that adaptively identifies the most informative feedback to collect.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses online resource allocation problems requiring fairness and stability by developing an active learning framework that collects feedback from only a single agent per time period. The key innovation is a dueling ULCB approach that uses both optimistic (UCB) and pessimistic (LCB) estimates to adaptively identify the most informative feedback while making allocation decisions. The framework handles max-min fairness, minimal envy fairness, and stable matching problems, showing that efficient decision-making is possible without extensive feedback.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a dueling upper-lower confidence bound (ULCB) framework that maintains both UCB and LCB estimates for each agent-good pair. At each time step, the algorithm computes allocations using UCB values, then selects which agent to query based on LCB values from that allocation. This approach addresses the challenge of limited feedback in online settings while maintaining sub-linear regret. The framework extends to bundle allocations through a combinatorial bandit approach and handles non-monotonic objectives like envy through separate optimistic and pessimistic estimates. For stable matching, it frames the problem as a hypothesis testing task to determine whether stable allocations exist.

## Key Results
- Theoretical sub-linear regret bounds achieved despite feedback restriction to single agent per period
- Dueling ULCB strategy effectively identifies most informative feedback through LCB selection while using UCB for decisions
- Framework successfully extends to combinatorial settings (bundle allocations) and non-monotonic objectives (envy minimization)
- Simulation experiments validate the approach and show substantial improvements over benchmark methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dueling ULCB approach adaptively identifies the most informative feedback by selecting agents based on lower confidence bounds while decisions use upper confidence bounds.
- Mechanism: For each agent-good pair, maintain UCB and LCB estimates. At each time step, compute the max-min allocation using UCB values, then select the agent with the lowest LCB from that allocation to collect feedback from.
- Core assumption: The UCB ordering converges to the true reward ordering, while LCB helps identify which agent's feedback will reduce uncertainty most effectively.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "key insight of our algorithms lies in adaptively identifying the most informative feedback using dueling upper and lower confidence bounds" [section 2.1] "the key idea to remedy such issues is a new procedure called Dueling ULCB"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: For bundle allocation problems, the algorithm reduces the combinatorial problem to base arm learning by leveraging Lipschitz-like reward properties.
- Mechanism: Use oracles to compute max-min allocations with UCB estimates and select feedback agents based on LCB estimates. The reward function's Lipschitz property ensures that partial knowledge of base arm rewards bounds the uncertainty in bundle rewards.
- Core assumption: The reward function satisfies Assumption 2 - bounded sensitivity to base arm reward changes and monotonicity.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] "the key idea that incremental knowledge of a few entries in low-dimensional quality vector, µ, improves our knowledge about rewards for all super-arms" [section 3.2] "Assumptions 2-3" which include the Lipschitz-like property

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: For minimal envy problems, maintaining optimistic (UCB-based) and pessimistic (LCB-based) estimates of envy allows correct identification despite non-monotonicity.
- Mechanism: Define upper and lower estimates of envy using UCB and LCB values, then solve for allocations minimizing the pessimistic estimate while using the optimistic estimate to select feedback agents.
- Core assumption: The constructed upper and lower estimates properly bound the true envy and maintain consistent ordering after sufficient exploration.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4] "we recognize the need for both an optimistic and a pessimistic estimate of envy" [section 4] "Instead, we use the main insight from UCB and LCB to construct upper and lower estimates of the true envy"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework with UCB/LCB confidence bounds
  - Why needed here: The online allocation problems require learning unknown reward distributions through sequential feedback, which is exactly what MAB algorithms address
  - Quick check question: In a standard MAB with N arms, what is the order of cumulative regret for UCB algorithm over T time periods?

- Concept: Combinatorial bandit extension to handle bundle allocations
  - Why needed here: Agents can receive sets of items rather than single items, requiring the algorithm to handle super-arms while still learning base arm rewards
  - Quick check question: Why can't we simply treat each bundle as a separate arm in the combinatorial setting?

- Concept: Hypothesis testing framework for stability constraints
  - Why needed here: The stable matching problem requires determining whether stable allocations exist without knowing true preferences, which maps to a statistical hypothesis testing problem
  - Quick check question: What are the two types of errors in the hypothesis testing framework for stable matching?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Oracles O1/OE1: Solve static optimization problems (max-min allocation, envy minimization) given reward estimates
  - Oracles O2/OE2: Identify agents with minimal/maximal reward or envy given allocation
  - Feedback selection logic: Chooses which agent to query based on LCB (or dual estimates for envy/stability)
  - Reward estimation: Maintains UCB/LCB bounds for each agent-good pair

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize by pulling each arm once
  2. At each time step: update UCB/LCB bounds → compute allocation using oracle → select feedback agent → collect reward → update estimates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity vs. sample complexity: Exact oracles may be expensive but reduce feedback needed
  - Exploration vs. exploitation: Balancing UCB-based decisions with LCB-based feedback selection
  - Feedback restriction: Single agent per period limits information but enables sub-linear regret

- Failure signatures:
  - Linear regret growth: Indicates algorithm isn't converging to correct allocations
  - Oscillating allocations: May suggest reward gaps too small or noise too high
  - Excessive oracle calls: Could indicate inefficient allocation computation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simple MAB with 3 arms, K=2 agents: Compare dueling ULCB vs naive UCB-only approaches
  2. Bundle allocation with identical agent rewards: Test Lipschitz assumption validity
  3. Minimal envy with synthetic preferences: Verify optimistic/pessimistic estimates converge correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the dueling ULCB approach be extended to problems where the feedback is restricted to more than κ agents per period while still maintaining sub-linear regret?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that future work could investigate the trade-off between regret and feedback size, suggesting that limiting feedback to κ agents might not be sufficient for more complex problems.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on settings where feedback is restricted to a single agent or a small constant number of agents, but doesn't explore scenarios with larger feedback sets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the performance of dueling ULCB algorithms with varying feedback sizes (e.g., 2κ, 5κ, 10κ agents) and corresponding regret bounds would clarify this trade-off.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the relaxation parameter ϵ in Algorithm 4 affect the Type I and Type II error rates, and can this be optimized theoretically?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the selection of ϵ is fundamental to the algorithm" and suggests practitioners should try multiple values, but doesn't provide theoretical guidance on optimal selection.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions that η − ∆M∗,q < ϵ < η is required, but doesn't characterize how different values within this range affect performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis providing an optimal range for ϵ based on problem parameters (∆M∗,q, η, σ², etc.) or empirical studies showing regret/error trade-offs across different ϵ values would address this.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational complexity trade-offs between exact and approximate oracles in the proposed algorithms, and how do these affect sample complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes computational oracles exist and focuses on sampling complexity rather than computational efficiency, noting this as an interesting direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses theoretical regret bounds, it doesn't analyze how using polynomial-time approximate oracles (instead of exact ones) would impact both computational and sample complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis comparing the performance of algorithms using approximate oracles (e.g., LP relaxations) versus exact oracles, including both computational time and regret bounds, would quantify these trade-offs.

## Limitations

- Oracle Implementation: The algorithms rely heavily on oracles for solving static optimization problems, but specific implementation details are not provided, creating uncertainty about computational tractability in practice.
- Assumption Sensitivity: The theoretical guarantees depend on assumptions about reward gaps and Lipschitz properties that may not hold in real-world settings, particularly for envy minimization where non-monotonicity complicates the analysis.
- Simulation Validation: While the paper mentions simulation experiments, details are sparse and there's limited empirical validation of the dueling ULCB mechanism compared to theoretical analysis.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core framework of using dueling upper-lower confidence bounds for adaptive feedback selection is well-established from the bandit literature and logically extends to the fair allocation setting.
- Medium Confidence: The theoretical regret bounds follow from established techniques but rely on specific assumptions about reward structures that may not generalize.
- Low Confidence: The empirical performance claims lack detailed experimental validation, making it difficult to assess real-world effectiveness.

## Next Checks

1. **Oracle Feasibility Study**: Implement the oracles for small-scale instances (K=3, N=5) to assess computational complexity and identify practical bottlenecks in the framework.

2. **Assumption Violation Testing**: Design experiments that systematically violate the Lipschitz and gap assumptions to quantify the impact on regret bounds and algorithm performance.

3. **Benchmark Comparison**: Implement a comprehensive simulation study comparing dueling ULCB against alternative active learning approaches (random feedback, UCB-only, Thompson sampling) across different fairness criteria and problem sizes.
