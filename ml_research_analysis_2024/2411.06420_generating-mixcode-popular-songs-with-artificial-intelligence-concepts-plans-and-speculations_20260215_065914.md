- Primary result: Conceptual framework for AI-generated Hinglish popular songs combining lyrics and melody generation with human validation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a conceptual framework for generating popular songs using artificial intelligence, focusing on the mixcode language Hinglish. The authors propose an interdisciplinary approach combining computer science and ethnomusicology to develop AI models for lyrics and melody generation, validated through human and machine learning processes. The framework aims to create culturally sensitive and appropriate music for South Asian contexts, addressing the potential for social transformation, education, and healthcare applications. While the project is still in its conceptual stage, it outlines the challenges and considerations involved in developing AI for song generation, including issues of bias, ethical use, and the complexity of matching music to lyrics in a culturally relevant manner.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves a three-component framework: (1) Generation of lyrics using a transformer model trained on Hinglish social media text, where users provide goals and purposes for the lyrics; (2) Generation of melodies using AI models that can produce singable melodies within popular song structures, with various input options such as written notation or audio; and (3) Validation processes that combine human evaluations from Hinglish speakers and conventional machine learning evaluations to assess the success of AI-generated songs. The approach emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and ethnomusicology to ensure cultural sensitivity throughout the development process.

## Key Results
- Conceptual framework for AI-generated Hinglish popular songs combining lyrics and melody generation
- Three-component approach including human and machine learning validation processes
- Emphasis on cultural sensitivity and addressing biases in AI models for South Asian contexts
- Identification of potential applications in social transformation, education, and healthcare

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and ethnomusicology enables culturally sensitive AI song generation
- Mechanism: Combining technical AI expertise with deep cultural understanding ensures the generated songs maintain cultural authenticity and relevance for South Asian contexts
- Core assumption: Cultural expertise can be effectively integrated into AI model development processes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This study focuses on developing a conceptual framework for creating music based on intents. This framework centres on the widely used the mixcode language Hinglish"
  - [section] "Our approach to this process is fundamentally interdisciplinary, involving two collaborators with very different backgrounds and skillsets. Creation of the generative AI for Hinglish song creation will be informed at every step by sociocultural considerations from anthropology and ethnomusicology."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers on AI music generation but none specifically address interdisciplinary cultural integration
- Break condition: If cultural experts cannot effectively communicate requirements to technical teams, or if technical constraints prevent cultural considerations from being implemented

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The three-component framework (lyrics generation, melody generation, human validation) creates a complete song generation pipeline
- Mechanism: Each component addresses a critical aspect of song creation - textual content, musical content, and quality assessment through human judgment
- Core assumption: Songs can be decomposed into these three separable components that can be generated and validated independently
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Details are as follows (see also Figure 2): • Generation of lyrics: The user provides their goal and purpose for the lyrics... • Generation of melodies: With this parameter, we will concentrate on generating a melody... • Validation processes: Evaluations can be categorized as human evaluations and other conventional machine learning evaluations."
  - [abstract] "The framework aims to create culturally sensitive and appropriate music for South Asian contexts"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss AI music generation but don't detail this specific three-component validation approach
- Break condition: If any component fails to produce acceptable output, or if validation processes cannot effectively assess the complete song

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using Hinglish as the target language enables access to a large, growing population while addressing a gap in existing language models
- Mechanism: Hinglish represents a significant linguistic market (over 1.9 billion people in SAARC countries) that current LLMs poorly serve due to its mixcode nature
- Core assumption: The size and growth of Hinglish speakers justifies the research investment and creates meaningful impact potential
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Hinglish reflects South Asia's rich culture and can influence the region's large and growing population, such as the over 1.4 billion people currently living in India... Taken together, the eight member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) – including India... were estimated to have a total population of over 1.9 billion by the end of 2021"
  - [abstract] "Given that music is culturally situated, and thus varies widely across cultural, social, and linguistic contexts, any understanding of generative AI and song generation must take into account these complexities"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains papers on music generation but none specifically address Hinglish or mixcode languages
- Break condition: If Hinglish proves too linguistically complex for current AI approaches, or if the cultural diversity within Hinglish-speaking regions prevents coherent model development

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Natural Language Processing fundamentals (tokenization, embeddings, sequence generation)
  - Why needed here: The lyrics generation component requires understanding how to process and generate Hinglish text
  - Quick check question: How would you handle the code-switching nature of Hinglish where English and Hindi words appear in the same sentence?
- Concept: Music information retrieval (pitch, rhythm, melody representation)
  - Why needed here: Melody generation requires converting musical concepts into data structures AI can process
  - Quick check question: What are the tradeoffs between using MIDI notation versus audio spectrograms for melody representation?
- Concept: Human-computer interaction and user experience design
  - Why needed here: The validation process requires designing interfaces that collect meaningful human feedback
  - Quick check question: How would you structure a user interface to gather both emotional and technical feedback on AI-generated songs?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Lyrics Generator (NLP pipeline) -> Melody Generator (music synthesis) -> Validation Service (human and ML evaluation)
- Critical path: User intent → Lyrics generation → Melody generation → Human validation → Feedback loop for model improvement
- Design tradeoffs: Using Hinglish limits training data availability but creates unique market opportunity; human validation is time-consuming but necessary for cultural appropriateness; separating lyrics and melody generation simplifies development but may miss synergies
- Failure signatures: Poor lyrics quality (inappropriate cultural references, grammatical errors); melodies that are unsingable or culturally mismatched; validation feedback that is inconsistent or unusable
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Hinglish text generation with small curated dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Generate simple melodies from existing lyrics to test musical appropriateness
  3. Conduct small-scale human validation with known good songs to calibrate evaluation criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can bias in AI models be effectively identified and mitigated when generating culturally-specific content like Hinglish songs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need to combat racial, cultural, linguistic, and other biases in large language models, particularly given the cultural specificity of Hinglish.
- Why unresolved: Current AI models are known to perpetuate human biases, and the mixcode nature of Hinglish adds additional complexity. The paper acknowledges this as a significant challenge but does not propose specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing AI-generated Hinglish content with human-generated content for bias indicators, along with documented successful bias mitigation techniques applied to the model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What combination of human and machine learning validation processes would most effectively evaluate the success of AI-generated songs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for a mixed-methods validation approach but notes that human validation is challenging due to individual differences in how people hear songs.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for validation but doesn't specify the optimal balance or methodology for combining human and machine learning validation processes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different validation approaches (purely human, purely machine, mixed) on AI-generated songs, with metrics for song "success" defined by target audience responses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific inputs and data sources would be most effective for training an AI to generate melodies that appropriately match lyrics in mixcode contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of melody generation, particularly the difficulty of matching music to lyrics in a culturally relevant manner, but doesn't identify optimal input sources.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents various input options (written notation, audio, etc.) and their limitations but doesn't determine which would work best for mixcode music generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of different input methods (notation, audio, etc.) for training AI models, measuring their effectiveness in producing culturally appropriate melody-lyric combinations validated by target audiences.

## Limitations
- The framework is entirely conceptual with no empirical validation or working system demonstrated
- Interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and ethnomusicology remains untested in practice
- Hinglish's code-switching nature may exceed current NLP model capabilities
- The complexity of matching music to lyrics in culturally relevant ways is acknowledged but not resolved

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The identified need for culturally sensitive AI music generation in South Asian contexts is well-established
- **Medium confidence**: The three-component framework structure represents a reasonable approach to song generation
- **Low confidence**: The specific implementation details for integrating cultural expertise into AI models, particularly for a mixcode language like Hinglish, have not been validated

## Next Checks
1. **Hinglish Text Generation Pilot**: Implement a small-scale transformer model trained on curated Hinglish social media data to assess whether current NLP techniques can handle the code-switching nature of the language and generate coherent, culturally appropriate lyrics.

2. **Melody Generation Feasibility Test**: Conduct a controlled experiment using existing melody generation models (such as MuseNet) to determine if they can produce singable, culturally appropriate melodies that could plausibly match generated lyrics, focusing on rhythm and phrasing compatibility.

3. **Cultural Expert Integration Assessment**: Design and execute a structured process where ethnomusicologists provide specific requirements to technical teams, then measure whether these requirements can be effectively translated into model constraints or training objectives without losing cultural nuance.
