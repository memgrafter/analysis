# Predicting path-dependent processes by deep learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.09941
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09941
- Authors: Xudong Zheng; Yuecai Han
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Deep learning framework for predicting path-dependent stochastic processes using discretely observed historical data with theoretical convergence guarantees for fractional Brownian motion

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep learning framework for predicting path-dependent stochastic processes using discretely observed historical data. The authors frame the prediction problem as nonparametric regression and use deep neural networks to learn the regression function from simulated samples. The method is theoretically proven to work for fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and solutions of stochastic differential equations driven by fBm, with L2 errors converging to zero as the frequency of discrete observations increases.

## Method Summary
The authors implement their method by considering prediction as a nonparametric regression problem, obtaining the regression function through simulated samples and deep neural networks. The prediction problem is formulated as minimizing mean square error (MSE) between predicted and true values, with the optimal predictor being the conditional expectation E[WT | F_s]. Deep neural networks are used to approximate this conditional expectation function, with theoretical guarantees for convergence when applied to fractional Brownian motion and related processes.

## Key Results
- The method achieves L2 error convergence to zero for fractional Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations
- Predictions based on discrete observations converge to those based on continuous observations as observation frequency increases
- Numerical experiments show mean square errors within small ranges compared to theoretical optimal predictions
- The method's performance is not significantly affected by the number of discrete observations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep neural networks can approximate the conditional expectation function for path-dependent processes as a nonparametric regression problem.
- Mechanism: The prediction problem is framed as minimizing mean square error (MSE) between predicted and true values. The optimal predictor is the conditional expectation E[WT | F_s], which is estimated via a neural network minimizing empirical MSE over simulated data.
- Core assumption: The conditional expectation function belongs to a function class that neural networks can approximate well (e.g., hierarchical composition models).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This method is implemented by considering the prediction as a nonparametric regression and obtaining the regression function through simulated samples and deep neural networks."
  - [section] "In nonparametric regression, we consider a random vector X ∈ Rd and a random variable Y ∈ R satisfying E[Y 2] < ∞. Nonparametric regression is aimed at predicting the value of the response variable Y from the value of the observation vector X..."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus focuses on parameter estimation rather than conditional expectation prediction, so direct evidence is limited.
- Break condition: If the regression function is not in a smooth or hierarchical composition class, the approximation error may not converge to zero.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The method works for Gaussian processes like fractional Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations.
- Mechanism: Since fBm is Gaussian, the conditional expectation has an explicit form via multivariate normal distribution properties. Neural networks can learn this relationship from simulated data.
- Core assumption: The process being predicted is Gaussian or can be expressed in terms of Gaussian processes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When applying this method to fractional Brownian motion and the solutions of some stochastic differential equations driven by it, we theoretically proved that the L2 errors converge to 0..."
  - [section] "Notice that Zt is Gaussian, so we can obtain the proposition for (7) in a similar way." (Proposition 11)
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on parameter estimation rather than Gaussian process prediction.
- Break condition: If the process is non-Gaussian and cannot be expressed through Gaussian components, the explicit conditional expectation formula may not exist.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: As observation frequency increases, predictions based on discrete observations converge to predictions based on continuous observations.
- Mechanism: With increasing N (number of discrete observations), the information captured approaches that of continuous observations. The neural network predictions converge to the theoretically optimal predictions.
- Core assumption: The process has continuous paths and the discrete observations become dense enough to approximate continuous information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "With the frequency of discrete observations tending to infinity, the predictions based on discrete observations converge to the predictions based on continuous observations..."
  - [section] "With the frequency of discrete observations tending to infinity, the predictions based on discrete observations converge to the predictions based on continuous observations, which implies that we can make approximations by the method."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence about convergence of discrete to continuous predictions.
- Break condition: If the process has discontinuities or the observation frequency doesn't increase sufficiently, convergence may not occur.

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: What function classes are known to be well-approximated by deep neural networks according to recent approximation theory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation -> Neural network training -> Prediction -> Evaluation
  - Data generation: Simulate sample paths of the stochastic process
  - Neural network training: Minimize empirical MSE using gradient-based optimization
  - Prediction: Use trained network to predict future values from discrete observations
  - Evaluation: Compare predictions with theoretical optimal predictions using MSE

- Critical path: The most critical component is the neural network architecture and training process, as this directly determines prediction accuracy.

- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Depth vs width of neural network: Deeper networks can capture more complex relationships but may overfit
  - Training data quantity: More data improves generalization but increases computational cost
  - Observation frequency: Higher frequency provides more information but increases dimensionality

- Failure signatures:
  - High MSE compared to theoretical optimal predictions
  - Predictions not converging as observation frequency increases
  - Network training failing to converge or overfitting

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the method on fractional Brownian motion with known analytical solution to verify convergence
  2. Vary the Hurst index H to observe its effect on prediction accuracy
  3. Compare predictions using different numbers of discrete observations to test convergence behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis is limited to Gaussian processes, particularly fractional Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations
- Neural network architecture and hyperparameters are not systematically explored
- The method's applicability to non-Gaussian path-dependent processes remains an open question

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The theoretical framework for Gaussian processes is sound, and the convergence results for fBm are mathematically rigorous.

**Medium Confidence**: Numerical experiments demonstrate practical effectiveness but are limited to a narrow class of processes.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about generalizability to non-Gaussian path-dependent processes are speculative and not supported by theoretical analysis or numerical experiments.

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on path-dependent processes with non-Gaussian distributions, such as jump-diffusion processes or processes with non-linear drift terms, to assess its broader applicability.

2. Systematically vary neural network architectures (depth, width, activation functions) and training procedures to determine the sensitivity of prediction accuracy to these choices and identify optimal configurations.

3. Conduct experiments with varying observation frequencies spanning multiple orders of magnitude to more rigorously verify the convergence claim and identify the rate of convergence for different Hurst parameters.
