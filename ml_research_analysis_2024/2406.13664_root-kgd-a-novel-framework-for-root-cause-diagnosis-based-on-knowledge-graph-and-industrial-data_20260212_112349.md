# Root-KGD: A Novel Framework for Root Cause Diagnosis Based on Knowledge Graph and Industrial Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13664
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13664
- Reference count: 35
- Novel fault root cause diagnosis framework integrating knowledge graph and industrial data

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Root-KGD, a novel fault root cause diagnosis framework that integrates knowledge graph and industrial data. The framework constructs a Prior Industrial Knowledge Graph (PIKG) to represent domain knowledge and uses data-driven modeling to extract fault features. A Ripple Fault Propagation Algorithm (RFPA) is designed to perform knowledge graph reasoning for root cause identification. The method is validated on two industrial processes, TEP and MFF, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to existing methods. Root-KGD not only provides accurate root cause variable diagnosis but also offers interpretable fault-related information by locating faults to physical entities in the knowledge graph. The lightweight nature of the framework makes it suitable for online industrial applications.

## Method Summary
Root-KGD combines knowledge graph reasoning with data-driven feature extraction for industrial fault diagnosis. The method constructs a PIKG encoding domain knowledge about physical entities and their relationships, extracts fault features using Reconstruction-Based Contribution (RBC) from industrial data, and applies RFPA to simulate fault propagation through the knowledge graph. Root cause scores are calculated by aligning RFPA results with RBC contributions using cosine similarity. The framework is validated on Tennessee Eastman Process and Multiphase Flow Facility datasets, demonstrating accurate root cause identification with interpretability benefits from the knowledge graph structure.

## Key Results
- Accurate root cause variable diagnosis on TEP and MFF industrial processes
- Improved accuracy compared to Transfer Entropy and Granger Causality methods
- Interpretable fault-related information through physical entity localization in PIKG
- Lightweight framework suitable for online industrial applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The knowledge graph integrates domain knowledge with data-driven features to enhance interpretability and accuracy in root cause diagnosis.
- Mechanism: PIKG encodes structural relationships between devices, streams, and variables, allowing fault propagation reasoning that combines static topology with dynamic fault data.
- Core assumption: The fault propagation behavior can be effectively modeled using relational paths and attenuation functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Root-KGD uses the knowledge graph to represent domain knowledge and employs data-driven modeling to extract fault features from industrial data."
  - [section] "PIKG is composed of two entity types: physical entities and data entities, denoted as E^p and E^d."
- Break condition: If the relational paths do not accurately represent the true fault propagation behavior, the model's reasoning will be flawed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Ripple Fault Propagation Algorithm (RFPA) simulates fault propagation through the knowledge graph to identify root cause nodes.
- Mechanism: RFPA propagates fault quantities from an initial node to connected nodes, with attenuation based on relation types and propagation frequency, until convergence.
- Core assumption: The attenuation parameters (dr, or, σr) can be set to reflect the true fault propagation dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Ripple Fault Propagation Algorithm (RFPA) is designed to perform knowledge graph reasoning for root cause identification."
  - [section] "RFPA is proposed based on the combination of structural features and entity fault features in knowledge graphs."
- Break condition: If the attenuation parameters are not well-tuned, the fault propagation simulation may not align with actual fault behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Root cause scores are calculated by aligning fault propagation results with data-driven fault contributions.
- Mechanism: Cosine similarity is used to compare the fault simulation sequence from RFPA with the contribution-based fault representation, yielding a root cause score.
- Core assumption: The fault contribution scores from RBC can effectively represent the fault state of variables.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It then combines the knowledge graph and data features to perform knowledge graph reasoning for root cause identification."
  - [section] "The aligned fault simulation sequence corresponding to Ev, denoted as S^A_V = {s^A_1, s^A_2, ..., s^A_nv}, is extracted from S^A_RFPA."
- Break condition: If the data-driven fault contributions do not accurately reflect the true fault state, the alignment will be ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its limitations in fault diagnosis
  - Why needed here: Understanding why RBC is used instead of traditional PCA-based contribution methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the "smearing effect" in PCA-based fault diagnosis, and how does RBC address it?

- Concept: Transfer Entropy and Granger Causality
  - Why needed here: To understand the comparison methods and their limitations in online industrial applications.
  - Quick check question: How do TE and GC differ in their approach to causal inference in time series data?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (TransE, ComplEx, RotateE)
  - Why needed here: To grasp the foundation of knowledge graph reasoning methods and why a new approach is proposed.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between TransE and ComplEx in terms of handling multi-relational data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  PIKG Construction -> Fault Feature Extraction -> RFPA Algorithm -> Root Cause Reasoning

- Critical path:
  1. Construct PIKG from domain knowledge
  2. Extract fault features using RBC on industrial data
  3. Apply RFPA to simulate fault propagation from each node
  4. Calculate root cause scores using cosine similarity between RFPA results and RBC contributions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. accuracy: Knowledge graph provides interpretability but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to deep learning methods
  - Online vs. offline: The lightweight nature of the framework enables online diagnosis, but may not capture all complex fault patterns

- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect PIKG construction: May lead to wrong fault propagation paths
  - Poor RBC results: If the data-driven contribution scores are inaccurate, the root cause reasoning will be flawed
  - Mis-tuned RFPA parameters: Can cause unrealistic fault propagation simulations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate PIKG construction on a simple industrial process with known fault propagation paths
  2. Test RBC fault feature extraction on synthetic data with controlled fault contributions
  3. Apply RFPA with various parameter settings on a small knowledge graph to observe fault propagation behavior

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of Root-KGD scale with the size and complexity of the industrial process and the knowledge graph?

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct systematic grid search or sensitivity analysis on RFPA parameters (σr, priority orders, attenuation factors) to determine stability of results and identify optimal parameter ranges, including testing on synthetic data with known ground truth.

2. **PIKG Construction Reproducibility Test**: Have independent domain experts construct PIKGs for same industrial process and compare resulting root cause diagnoses to validate robustness to different interpretations of domain knowledge.

3. **Scalability Benchmark**: Apply framework to larger industrial dataset with 100+ variables and measure computational time, memory usage, and accuracy degradation; compare against GNN-based methods to assess claimed "lightweight" advantage in realistic scenarios.
