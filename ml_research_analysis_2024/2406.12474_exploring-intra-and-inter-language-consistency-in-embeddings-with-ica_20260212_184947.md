# Exploring Intra and Inter-language Consistency in Embeddings with ICA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.12474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12474
- Authors: Rongzhi Li; Takeru Matsuda; Hitomi Yanaka
- Reference count: 12
- One-line primary result: ICA reveals interpretable semantic axes in word embeddings, with approximately 30% of identified axes showing consistency across English, Japanese, and Chinese, supported by fair human agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.364).

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the consistency of semantic axes within and across languages using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on word embeddings. The authors employ Icasso to ensure the reproducibility of ICA components by running multiple iterations and clustering the results, identifying high-quality semantic axes for English, Japanese, and Chinese. They then apply statistical tests to verify inter-language consistency, finding significant correspondences among the semantic axes across the three languages. The results demonstrate that ICA can uncover universal semantic axes, with approximately 30% of the identified axes showing consistency across languages, supported by a Fleiss' kappa score of 0.364 indicating fair agreement with human judgment.

## Method Summary
The authors apply ICA to 300-dimensional FastText word embeddings for English, Japanese, and Chinese (50,000 words each, with 6,903 common across languages). They use Icasso to run ICA multiple times (10 runs) and cluster the results, identifying high-quality components with quality index >0.8. For each retained component, they identify the top 3 representative words by sorting the S matrix rows. They then perform pairwise statistical tests across languages using the Hyvärinen and Ramkumar (2013) method, with FDR=1% and FPR=1% thresholds, to find consistent semantic axes. The resulting clusters are evaluated via human judgment (5 bilingual/trilingual annotators, binary classification, Fleiss' kappa calculation).

## Key Results
- ICA reveals interpretable semantic axes in word embeddings by decomposing them into statistically independent components.
- Approximately 30% of the identified semantic axes show consistency across English, Japanese, and Chinese.
- Human evaluation with a Fleiss' kappa score of 0.364 indicates fair agreement with the statistical findings.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ICA reveals interpretable semantic axes in word embeddings by decomposing them into statistically independent components.
- Mechanism: ICA assumes that word embeddings can be represented as a linear mixture of independent latent semantic features. By maximizing non-Gaussianity of these features, ICA extracts components that correspond to distinct semantic concepts (e.g., "fruit" axis for apple, banana, peach).
- Core assumption: Word embeddings contain independent semantic dimensions that can be linearly separated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ICA creates clearer semantic axes by identifying independent key features."
  - [section 2]: "ICA is based on the assumption that X is represented as X = AS, where A indicates how these factors are combined in each of the d observed variables."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for independence assumption in embeddings.
- Break condition: If word embeddings contain highly correlated semantic features or non-linear dependencies that cannot be separated linearly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Icasso ensures reproducibility of ICA components by clustering multiple runs.
- Mechanism: ICA results can vary due to random initialization. Icasso runs ICA multiple times (m runs) and computes similarity measures between all pairs of components across runs. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering groups similar components, and quality indices identify highly reproducible clusters.
- Core assumption: Reproducible ICA components will cluster together across multiple runs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "Icasso was proposed to solve the reliability problem in ICA by implementing ICA multiple times and then clustering them."
  - [section 3.1]: "Clusters with a quality index close to 1 represent highly reproducible independent components."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence for effectiveness of Icasso clustering in NLP domain.
- Break condition: If ICA components are inherently unstable or if noise dominates the signal, making clustering ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Statistical tests identify consistent semantic axes across languages by testing independence between components.
- Mechanism: For each pair of languages, compute p-values for null hypothesis that components are independent. Use FDR/FPR corrections for multiple testing. Components with low p-values are considered significantly similar and clustered together.
- Core assumption: Semantic axes with similar activation patterns across languages indicate universal concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "We apply the method proposed by Hyvärinen and Ramkumar (2013)... to explore common independent components across subjects."
  - [section 5.1]: "As a result of the inter-language analysis, 47 clusters, 120 out of 354 (118 × 3) vectors, were found."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence for universality of semantic axes across languages.
- Break condition: If languages have fundamentally different semantic structures or if statistical tests are too conservative/eager.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
  - Why needed here: ICA is the core technique for extracting interpretable semantic axes from word embeddings.
  - Quick check question: What assumption does ICA make about the data matrix X?
- Concept: Statistical significance testing and multiple hypothesis correction
  - Why needed here: To validate that identified cross-language correspondences are not due to chance.
  - Quick check question: Why do we need FDR correction when testing multiple component pairs?
- Concept: Clustering evaluation metrics (quality index)
  - Why needed here: To assess the reliability of ICA components within a single language.
  - Quick check question: What does a quality index close to 1 indicate about an ICA component cluster?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Icasso module -> Statistical testing module -> Interpretation module -> Validation module

- Critical path:
  1. Load word embeddings for all languages
  2. Apply Icasso to each language independently
  3. Select high-quality components from each language
  4. Perform pairwise statistical tests across languages
  5. Cluster consistent components across languages
  6. Interpret components with representative words
  7. Validate results with human judgment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of ICA runs vs. computational cost (10 runs chosen)
  - Number of clusters vs. granularity of semantic axes (300 clusters chosen)
  - Significance thresholds (FDR=1%, FPR=1%) vs. false positives/negatives
  - Number of representative words (3 chosen) vs. interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Low quality indices across all clusters → ICA instability or insufficient data
  - Few inter-language correspondences → Language-specific semantics or conservative thresholds
  - Poor human agreement (low Fleiss' kappa) → Misalignment between statistical and human notions of semantic similarity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply Icasso to English embeddings only, verify quality index distribution matches expectations
  2. Perform pairwise statistical tests between English and Japanese, check p-value distribution
  3. Apply the full pipeline to a smaller subset of words (e.g., 1000 most frequent) to verify end-to-end functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the number of semantic axes (independent components) identified in each language relate to the linguistic properties of that language (e.g., morphological complexity, vocabulary size)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that Chinese has more clusters than Japanese despite both being target languages, and suggests this may be due to Chinese words having more meanings or correspondences with English words.
- Why unresolved: The paper only speculates on possible reasons without conducting a systematic linguistic analysis to verify the relationship between language properties and the number of semantic axes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the morphological and lexical properties of the three languages (English, Japanese, Chinese) with the number of semantic axes identified could reveal if there's a correlation between language structure and the complexity of semantic representations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do contextualized word embeddings (like BERT) compare to static embeddings (like FastText) in terms of identifying universal semantic axes across languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions they attempted to use BERT but faced challenges due to the lack of sufficient multilingual parallel corpora, particularly for English, Japanese, and Chinese.
- Why unresolved: The paper couldn't include results from BERT due to data limitations and convergence issues, leaving a gap in understanding how contextual embeddings perform in this task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a large-scale multilingual parallel corpus and ensuring proper convergence of ICA on contextualized embeddings would allow a direct comparison with static embeddings and reveal if contextual information improves the identification of universal semantic axes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the identified universal semantic axes be effectively utilized for machine translation tasks, and if so, what are the limitations and potential improvements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that the robust and reliable semantic axes identified could be combined to construct compositional semantic maps and potentially applied to translation among words in different languages based on the correspondence among components.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the practical application of these semantic axes in translation tasks, nor does it discuss the potential challenges or limitations of such an approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing a translation system that leverages the identified semantic axes and evaluating its performance on various translation tasks (e.g., word-level, phrase-level, sentence-level) would demonstrate the practical utility and limitations of using universal semantic axes for machine translation.

## Limitations
- The study lacks direct corpus evidence supporting the independence assumption underlying ICA.
- The statistical tests for inter-language consistency may be overly conservative or eager, potentially missing subtle but meaningful semantic correspondences.
- The human judgment validation represents a relatively small-scale evaluation that may not capture the full complexity of cross-linguistic semantic relationships.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The reproducibility mechanism via Icasso and the statistical framework for inter-language comparison are well-established methods with clear implementation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The identification of consistent semantic axes across languages is supported by statistical evidence but requires further validation with larger human studies.
- **Low Confidence**: The core assumption that ICA can reveal universal semantic axes in word embeddings lacks direct corpus validation and may be language-dependent.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct corpus-based validation of the independence assumption by analyzing co-occurrence patterns and correlation structures in the original embeddings to verify whether semantic features are indeed independent and linearly separable.
2. Perform a larger-scale human evaluation with diverse annotators across multiple language pairs to assess the generalizability of the inter-language consistency findings and refine the Fleiss' kappa interpretation.
3. Test the methodology on additional language pairs (e.g., Spanish-French, Arabic-Hebrew) and different embedding models (e.g., BERT, GloVe) to evaluate the robustness of the ICA-based semantic axis extraction across linguistic families and embedding architectures.
