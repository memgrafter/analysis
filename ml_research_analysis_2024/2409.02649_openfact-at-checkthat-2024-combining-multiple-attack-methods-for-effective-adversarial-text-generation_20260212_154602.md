# OpenFact at CheckThat! 2024: Combining Multiple Attack Methods for Effective Adversarial Text Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.02649
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02649
- Reference count: 33
- This study proposes an ensemble learning approach combining multiple adversarial attack methods to improve attack effectiveness in text classification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of generating effective adversarial examples for text classification models in credibility assessment tasks. The authors propose an ensemble learning approach that combines multiple adversarial attack methods, including modified versions of BERT-Attack, Genetic algorithms, TextFooler, and CLARE, to improve attack effectiveness. Their methodology involves systematically testing and refining these methods on five datasets across different misinformation tasks. The results show significant improvements in BODEGA scores, with their best method achieving scores ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 across different tasks and victim models. Notably, the CLARE method demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest BODEGA scores in most cases while preserving textual similarity and fluency. The study concludes that combining multiple attack strategies can create more sophisticated and effective adversarial attacks, contributing to the development of more robust and secure systems. Future work includes exploring additional ensemble configurations and integrating large language models for further improvements.

## Method Summary
The study employs an ensemble approach to generate adversarial text examples for classification models. The methodology systematically tests and refines multiple adversarial attack methods including modified BERT-Attack, Genetic algorithms, TextFooler, and CLARE. The approach is applied across five datasets covering fake news classification, hate speech detection, propaganda recognition, rumor detection, and COVID-19 misinformation detection. The attack methods are combined in a staged pipeline where each method addresses weaknesses of previous ones. The effectiveness is evaluated using BODEGA scores, which combine confusion score, semantic score (using BLEURT), and character score (based on Levenshtein distance).

## Key Results
- The ensemble approach achieved significant improvements in BODEGA scores, ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 across different tasks and victim models
- CLARE method demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest BODEGA scores in most cases while preserving textual similarity and fluency
- Modified BERT-Attack with increased substitute candidates and adjusted thresholds showed improved attack success rates while maintaining semantic preservation
- The ensemble approach proved more effective than individual attack methods, with CLARE achieving BODEGA scores of 0.92, 0.83, and 0.82 for BERT, BiLSTM, and RoBERTa models respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ensemble methods improve adversarial attack effectiveness by combining complementary strengths of different attack algorithms.
- Mechanism: The paper systematically combines multiple adversarial attack methods (BERT-Attack, Genetic algorithms, TextFooler, CLARE) in a staged approach where each method addresses weaknesses of others. When one method fails, another is applied, creating a more robust attack pipeline.
- Core assumption: Different attack methods have complementary failure modes, so combining them will cover more edge cases than any single method.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our methodology involves systematically testing and refining these methods... By developing modified versions of BERT-Attack and hybrid methods, we achieved significant improvements"
  - [section 4] "In general our approach can be characterized as a special case of ensemble learning. We took the inspiration from this machine learning group of techniques."
- Break condition: If attack methods share similar failure modes or if computational overhead outweighs performance gains, the ensemble approach may not provide meaningful improvement.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modified BERT-Attack with increased substitute candidates and adjusted thresholds improves attack success while maintaining semantic similarity.
- Mechanism: The BAm variant increases substitute candidates from 36 to 72 and lowers the threshold_pred_score from 0.3 to 0.2, allowing the algorithm to select less semantically related substitutes that are more likely to fool the classifier while still preserving overall meaning.
- Core assumption: Increasing the pool of substitute candidates while relaxing semantic constraints will improve attack success without significantly degrading text quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Due to the fact, that balance between semantic preservation and attack success rate can be regulated throughout a threshold of semantic similarity score of substituted word, we modified 'threshold_pred_score' parameter from 0.3 to 0.2."
  - [table 2] Shows BAm improves BODEGA scores in many cases due to higher success scores despite slightly reduced semantic scores.
- Break condition: If semantic degradation becomes too severe or if the increased computational cost outweighs the modest gains in attack success.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CLARE's mask-then-infill procedure using pre-trained masked language models provides superior attack effectiveness while preserving textual similarity and fluency.
- Mechanism: CLARE employs contextualized perturbations (Replace, Insert, Merge) that allow flexible text modification beyond simple word substitution, leveraging the pre-trained masked language model to generate fluent and grammatical adversarial examples.
- Core assumption: The mask-then-infill approach can generate more natural and effective perturbations than simple synonym replacement while maintaining text quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "This algorithm outperforms other adversarial attack methods due to its unique mask-then-infill procedure using a pre-trained masked language model."
  - [table 3] CLARE achieves the highest BODEGA scores in most cases, with scores ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 across different tasks and victim models.
- Break condition: If the computational cost of the mask-then-infill procedure becomes prohibitive or if the pre-trained model's understanding doesn't generalize well to all domains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial attack methodology and BODEGA evaluation framework
  - Why needed here: Understanding how adversarial attacks work and how their effectiveness is measured is crucial for implementing and evaluating the ensemble approach
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of the BODEGA score and how do they measure different aspects of attack effectiveness?

- Concept: Ensemble learning principles and their application to adversarial attacks
  - Why needed here: The paper's core innovation is applying ensemble learning concepts to adversarial attack methods, so understanding these principles is essential
  - Quick check question: How does the staged approach (BAm2 → Genetic → GSWSE&TF → CLARE) embody ensemble learning principles?

- Concept: Natural language processing model vulnerabilities and attack strategies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how NLP models can be fooled through text perturbations is fundamental to implementing the attack methods
  - Quick check question: What are the different types of text perturbations used in adversarial attacks (character, word, sentence level)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input text → BAm2 modifications → if failed, Genetic algorithm → if failed, GSWSE&TF → if failed, CLARE → output adversarial examples
- Critical path: The staged pipeline processes text through four main attack stages, with each stage handling cases that failed previous stages
- Design tradeoffs: Computational cost vs. attack effectiveness (more sophisticated methods like CLARE are more effective but computationally expensive), semantic preservation vs. attack success (relaxing constraints improves success but may degrade text quality), method complexity vs. implementation difficulty (ensemble approach is more complex to implement and maintain)
- Failure signatures: Low BODEGA scores despite high success rates (indicating poor semantic preservation), computational timeouts during CLARE processing, inconsistent performance across different victim models or datasets, manual annotation discrepancies showing semantic changes not captured by BLEURT
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and test the modified BERT-Attack (BAm2) on a single dataset to establish baseline improvements over standard BERT-Attack
  2. Add the Genetic algorithm fallback for cases where BAm2 fails, measuring the improvement in success rate
  3. Implement the GSWSE&TF hybrid approach and compare its BODEGA scores against the BAm2&Genetic combination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of adversarial attacks vary across different languages beyond English and Chinese?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that OpenAttack supports multilingual capabilities and has the potential for additional languages.
- Why unresolved: The study primarily focused on English datasets, and the authors did not explore the effectiveness of their methods on other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with adversarial attacks on non-English datasets to compare effectiveness and performance across multiple languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using large language models (LLMs) on the quality and naturalness of adversarial examples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors plan to extend their methods by using various data sources and large language models (LLMs) in future work.
- Why unresolved: The study did not incorporate LLMs in their current experiments, leaving the potential impact on adversarial example quality unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating LLMs into the adversarial attack framework and evaluating the resulting adversarial examples for naturalness and effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different ensemble configurations affect the robustness and success rate of adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention exploring additional ensemble configurations in future work to develop more robust adversarial attack frameworks.
- Why unresolved: The study tested specific ensemble methods but did not exhaustively explore the full range of possible configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically testing various ensemble configurations and comparing their performance in terms of attack success rate and robustness against different victim models.

## Limitations

- The evaluation framework relies heavily on the BODEGA metric, which may not fully capture nuanced aspects of adversarial effectiveness
- The modified BERT-Attack method shows improved performance but with slightly reduced semantic scores, raising questions about the trade-off between attack success and text quality preservation
- The ensemble approach's computational efficiency remains unclear, particularly for the CLARE method which is computationally expensive

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core claim that ensemble methods improve adversarial attack effectiveness is well-supported by systematic experimentation across multiple datasets and victim models.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about the optimal balance between semantic preservation and attack success require further validation, as the long-term implications for text quality and model robustness are not fully explored.

**Low Confidence:** The novelty and effectiveness of the specific ensemble configuration proposed (BAm2 → Genetic → GSWSE&TF → CLARE) need further validation, as alternative configurations could potentially yield better results.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study of Ensemble Components:** Systematically remove each component of the ensemble (starting with CLARE) to quantify its individual contribution to overall performance and determine if simpler combinations could achieve similar results with lower computational cost.

2. **Cross-Domain Robustness Testing:** Apply the ensemble approach to datasets outside the original five domains, particularly focusing on specialized domains like legal or medical text, to evaluate generalizability and identify potential domain-specific failure modes.

3. **Human Evaluation of Semantic Preservation:** Conduct comprehensive human evaluations comparing BLEURT scores with human judgments of semantic similarity and fluency, particularly for cases where BODEGA scores indicate high success but potential semantic degradation.
