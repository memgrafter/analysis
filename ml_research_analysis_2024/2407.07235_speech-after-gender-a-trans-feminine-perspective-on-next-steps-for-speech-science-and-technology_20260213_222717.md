# Speech After Gender: A Trans-Feminine Perspective on Next Steps for Speech Science and Technology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.07235
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07235
- Reference count: 0
- Speaker verification models achieve 21.52-29.00% EER on voice-modified dataset vs near-perfect performance on standard benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges fundamental assumptions in speech technology by demonstrating that current speaker modeling approaches fail when confronted with intra-speaker voice modification. Using the Versatile Voice Dataset (VVD) where trans-feminine voice teachers modify their voices across 27 pitch, resonance, and weight configurations, the authors show that speaker verification models perform poorly while gender classification models produce predictions spanning the full male-female range. The work argues that treating gender as a categorical proxy for vocal texture is inadequate for capturing the flexibility of human vocal identity.

## Method Summary
The study creates the Versatile Voice Dataset (VVD) with 3 trans-feminine speakers producing 6 sentences in 27 voice configurations each, varying pitch, resonance, and weight. Speaker verification is evaluated using pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN models from SpeechBrain and NeMo, with EER computed on VVD versus standard benchmarks (VoxCeleb1, VCTK). Gender classification uses Random Forest on speaker embeddings, comparing performance on VVD versus unmodified speech. Human perception studies involve expert and non-expert listeners identifying same-speaker voices across configurations. The analysis demonstrates fundamental failures of categorical gender approaches and proposes modeling individual vocal qualities as a path forward.

## Key Results
- Speaker verification EER reaches 21.52-29.00% on VVD versus near-perfect performance on standard benchmarks
- Gender classification models produce predictions spanning the full 0-1 (female-male) range across voice modifications
- Expert listeners perform near chance levels identifying same-speaker voices across extreme modifications
- Vocal qualities (pitch, resonance, weight) show near-perfect correlation with expert rankings but poor correlation with model predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speaker verification models fail because they assume vocal texture is static, but voice modification shows high intra-speaker variability
- Mechanism: Current speaker verification systems use embeddings that capture speaker identity as a fixed characteristic. When speakers modify their voice along pitch, resonance, and weight dimensions, the resulting audio contains similar acoustic features to different speakers, causing the models to misclassify same-speaker voices as different speakers
- Core assumption: Speaker identity is treated as a static property rather than a dynamic one that can vary while maintaining speaker identity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This modeling approach to speaker verification fundamentally assumes that a speaker's vocal texture is static, which is violated by the speakers in the VVD"
  - [section] "the EER of speaker verification on VVD is remarkably higher than typical test performance, with EER on VVD being 21.52% for NeMo and 29.00% for SpeechBrain"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on speaker verification but don't specifically address voice modification scenarios
- Break condition: If models are trained on diverse voice modifications from the same speakers, they would learn to recognize intra-speaker variability as part of speaker identity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gender classification fails because categorical gender labels cannot capture the continuous perceptual space of voice qualities
- Mechanism: Gender classification models map voice features to binary categories, but voice modification creates intermediate points in this space. As pitch, resonance, and weight change, the model's predictions shift continuously across the gender spectrum rather than staying within one category, revealing that gender is being used as a proxy for vocal texture
- Core assumption: Gender can be treated as a discrete category for voice classification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Using gender as a proxy, however, begins to lose its predictive power with more vocal diversity"
  - [section] "we see that the predictions across voices span almost the entire range of 0 (Female) to 1 (Male) for both models and all speakers"
  - [section] "While current speaker embeddings do implicitly encode high-level perceptual qualities such as pitch and resonance, multiple configurations produce similar predictions, revealing an ambiguity between vocal configuration and binary gender"
- Break condition: If models are trained to predict continuous vocal qualities instead of categorical gender, they would better capture the relationship between voice modification and perceived gender

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human listeners, including experts, struggle to identify same-speaker voices across extreme modifications because they assume vocal texture is fixed
- Mechanism: Both human perception and automated models rely on the assumption that a speaker's voice remains relatively constant. When presented with highly modified voices, listeners lack reference points for recognizing the underlying speaker identity, leading to performance near chance levels for extreme modifications
- Core assumption: Vocal texture is fixed and deviations indicate different speakers
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we see that, across both types of pairs, even experts struggle to tell if two voice clips are produced by the same speaker, performing at random when voices are most distinct"
  - [section] "non-expert performance diverges with that of experts, consistently rating voices with an L1-Distance greater than 3 as belonging to different speakers"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss speaker verification but don't address human perception of modified voices
- Break condition: If listeners are explicitly trained to recognize intra-speaker variability and given contextual information about voice modification techniques, their performance would improve

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Voice modification techniques and their acoustic correlates
  - Why needed here: Understanding how pitch, resonance, and weight modification affects acoustic features is crucial for interpreting why current models fail and how to improve them
  - Quick check question: How does increasing pharyngeal resonance affect formant frequencies and overall voice quality?

- Concept: Speaker verification and gender classification model architectures
  - Why needed here: Knowing how ECAPA-TDNN and similar models extract and use speaker embeddings helps understand why they fail on modified voices and what architectural changes might help
  - Quick check question: What acoustic features do speaker verification models typically emphasize, and how might these change with voice modification?

- Concept: Perceptual voice qualities and their measurement
  - Why needed here: Moving beyond categorical gender requires understanding how to measure and model pitch, resonance, and weight as continuous variables
  - Quick check question: What acoustic measurements best capture the perceptual qualities of resonance and weight in voice?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection (VVD creation) → Feature extraction (ECAPA-TDNN embeddings) → Classification (gender and speaker verification) → Analysis (error analysis and human perception studies)
- Critical path: VVD creation → baseline model evaluation → error analysis → proposed improvements (vocal texture modeling)
- Design tradeoffs: Using categorical gender labels provides simple classification but loses information about vocal texture; modeling continuous vocal qualities requires more complex representations but captures richer information
- Failure signatures: High EER on VVD indicates models assume static speaker identity; gender predictions spanning full range indicate categorical gender cannot capture voice modification; human performance near chance on extreme modifications indicates perceptual assumptions about fixed vocal texture
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train speaker verification models on modified voices from the same speakers to see if they can learn intra-speaker variability
  2. Replace categorical gender labels with continuous vocal quality measurements and retrain gender classification models
  3. Implement and evaluate the proposed baseline vocal texture measurement using F0, formants, and HNR as features for speaker identification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the theoretical limits of behavioral voice modification across pitch, resonance, and weight dimensions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "With training, the human voice is incredibly flexible, and the limits of intra-speaker vocal flexibility are unknown."
- Why unresolved: Current research has focused on typical voices and inter-speaker variability rather than exploring the full range of intra-speaker modifications possible through behavioral training.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive dataset mapping the complete perceptual space of vocal modifications achievable by trained speakers, along with acoustic measurements establishing boundaries of human vocal tract flexibility.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can speaker verification systems be designed to maintain accuracy across extreme intra-speaker voice modifications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that speaker verification systems achieve high error rates (21.52-29.00% EER) on voices modified across 27 configurations, compared to near-perfect performance on standard benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: Current speaker verification models assume static vocal characteristics and are trained on unmodified voices, failing to account for deliberate behavioral modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of speaker verification models explicitly trained on diverse intra-speaker modifications that achieve low error rates across extreme voice transformations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal representation for modeling individual vocal qualities like pitch, resonance, and weight?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose modeling individual qualities of vocal texture such as pitch, resonance, and weight, but note that current PQ-Representation models perform poorly on the VVD dataset.
- Why unresolved: Existing perceptual voice quality models are based on cisgender voices and fail to capture the full complexity of vocal texture across diverse voice modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a new representation model that accurately captures intra-speaker vocal variations across pitch, resonance, and weight dimensions, validated on diverse voice modification datasets.

## Limitations
- Dataset size (3 speakers, 27 configurations, 6 sentences) limits generalizability to broader populations
- Focus on trans-feminine voice teachers may not capture full diversity of voice modification practices
- Reliance on pre-trained models without fine-tuning means results show current limitations but don't explore fundamental architectural constraints

## Confidence
- High confidence: Speaker verification models achieve high EER (21.52-29.00%) on VVD while maintaining near-perfect performance on standard benchmarks
- Medium confidence: Human experts struggle to identify same-speaker voices across extreme modifications
- Medium confidence: Gender classification models produce predictions spanning the full male-female range on modified voices

## Next Checks
1. Generalize findings to larger populations by extending VVD to 10-20 speakers representing diverse voice modification practices, demographics, and techniques
2. Fine-tune ECAPA-TDNN models on modified voices from the same speakers within VVD to determine whether current architectures can learn intra-speaker variability
3. Implement and evaluate the proposed vocal texture measurement system using F0, formants, and HNR features on VVD to assess improvements over categorical gender approaches
