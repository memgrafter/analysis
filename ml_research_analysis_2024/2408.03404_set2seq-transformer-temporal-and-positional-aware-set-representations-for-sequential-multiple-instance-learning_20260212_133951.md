# Set2Seq Transformer: Temporal and Positional-Aware Set Representations for Sequential Multiple-Instance Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.03404
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03404
- **Reference count**: 40
- **One-line primary result**: Set2Seq Transformer outperforms strong static and temporal baselines on both artistic success prediction and short-term wildfire danger forecasting tasks.

## Executive Summary
Set2Seq Transformer addresses sequential multiple-instance learning by combining permutation-invariant set representations with temporal modeling. The model learns representations that capture both the relative ordering of events within sequences (via positional encodings) and the absolute time progression across timesteps (via learnable temporal embeddings). This dual temporal encoding enables effective modeling of both local phenomena and global temporal characteristics. Evaluated on two diverse tasks—artistic success prediction using WikiArt images and wildfire danger forecasting using fire-driving variables—the method demonstrates superior performance compared to static and temporal baselines, particularly in early forecasting scenarios with limited temporal context.

## Method Summary
Set2Seq Transformer jointly learns permutation-invariant set representations, positional encodings, and learnable temporal embeddings. The model first processes unordered sets using DeepSets or Set Transformer architectures to obtain set representations. These are then combined with positional encodings (sine/cosine functions for relative positions) and temporal embeddings (learnable functions for absolute time) before being fed into a Transformer encoder. The architecture is evaluated on two tasks: WikiArt-Seq2Rank for artistic success prediction (ranking artists based on visual features) and Mesogeos for wildfire danger forecasting (binary classification based on fire-driving variables). The method uses pointwise MSE loss for ranking tasks and weighted cross-entropy for classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves superior Kendall's τ and MAE scores on WikiArt-Seq2Rank for multiple artistic success indicators (mentions in eBooks, NYT reviews, Wikipedia pageviews)
- Delivers higher PR-AUC and F1-scores on Mesogeos dataset, especially under early forecasting conditions with limited temporal context
- Outperforms strong static baselines (DeepSets, Set Transformer) and temporal baselines (LSTM, Transformer with max pooling) across both tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining positional encodings with learnable temporal embeddings enables the model to capture both local phenomena (via positional encodings) and global temporal characteristics (via temporal embeddings).
- Mechanism: The model learns a representation for each timestep by summing three components: a set representation, a positional encoding, and a temporal embedding. The positional encoding uses sine and cosine functions to capture relative positions within the sequence, while the temporal embedding uses a learnable function to encode absolute time progression.
- Core assumption: The relative order of timesteps within a sequence provides different information than the absolute time values, and both are necessary for effective modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It combines positional encodings with learnable temporal embeddings to capture both relative ordering and absolute time progression"
  - [section]: "We argue that encoding position-aware representations of observed events in a fixed and finite time interval... can capture local phenomena... In addition, learning temporal representations of observed events in discrete timesteps across not predefined and almost infinite time intervals... can capture global characteristics"
- Break condition: If the task only requires either local ordering or global time progression but not both, or if the two types of temporal information are redundant for the specific domain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Set2Seq Transformer improves performance by effectively learning permutation-invariant set representations while capturing temporal dependencies.
- Mechanism: The model first learns permutation-invariant representations of individual sets using DeepSets or Set Transformer architectures, then processes these set representations through a Transformer encoder that incorporates both positional and temporal information.
- Core assumption: Static multiple-instance learning methods cannot capture temporal dynamics, while sequential methods cannot represent sets, making a combined approach necessary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It combines positional encodings with learnable temporal embeddings to capture both relative ordering and absolute time progression"
  - [section]: "This is in contrast to static multiple-instance learning,
