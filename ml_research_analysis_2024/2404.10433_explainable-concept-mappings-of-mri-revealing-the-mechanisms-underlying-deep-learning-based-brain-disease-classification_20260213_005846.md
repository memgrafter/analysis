# Explainable concept mappings of MRI: Revealing the mechanisms underlying deep learning-based brain disease classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.10433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10433
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: CNN achieves 75.64% balanced accuracy in AD classification using R2* maps, with concepts primarily in basal ganglia consistent with iron accumulation pathology

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of interpreting deep neural networks used for Alzheimer's disease classification by investigating the concepts learned by convolutional neural networks using quantitative MRI data (R2* maps) and Concept Relevance Propagation. The researchers trained a relevance-guided CNN to classify AD patients from normal controls using R2* maps, then systematically analyzed the learned concepts through CRP and compared results with conventional region of interest analysis. The CNN achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 75.64%±5.16%, sensitivity of 69.67%±9.55%, specificity of 81.61%±5.45%, and AUC of 0.76±0.05. The study demonstrated that heat- and concept mapping can serve as exploratory tools to identify areas of pathological tissue changes and reveal internal mechanisms of deep learning classification networks for medical diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The study used a relevance-guided CNN (Graz+ architecture) to classify Alzheimer's disease patients from normal controls using R2* MRI maps. The method involved calculating R2* maps from spoiled FLASH sequences, registering them to MNI152 standard space, and training a 4-layer CNN with relevance guidance for 60 epochs. Concept Relevance Propagation was then applied to analyze the learned concepts by conditioning on specific hidden-layer channels, allowing visualization of how each concept contributes to final classification. Results were validated against conventional region of interest analysis and histological findings about iron accumulation in AD.

## Key Results
- The CNN achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 75.64%±5.16%, sensitivity of 69.67%±9.55%, specificity of 81.61%±5.45%, and AUC of 0.76±0.05
- Highly relevant concepts were primarily found in and adjacent to the basal ganglia, consistent with established histological findings about iron accumulation in AD
- Concept Relevance Propagation successfully isolated and identified individual learned concepts within the CNN, providing granular insights into the network's decision-making process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The CNN learns high-level visual concepts that align with pathological tissue changes in AD.
- Mechanism: The relevance-guided CNN uses R2* maps as input, where higher R2* values indicate increased iron concentration. Since iron accumulation is a known pathological feature in AD, the network learns to identify patterns of increased R2* in specific brain regions (basal ganglia) as discriminative features.
- Core assumption: The CNN's learned features (concepts) from R2* maps correspond to actual pathological changes rather than data artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In line with established histological findings and the region of interest-based analyses, highly relevant concepts were primarily found in and adjacent to the basal ganglia."
  - [section 2.5] "R2* is highly positively correlated with iron concentration in gray matter, and increased iron levels in the left and the right basal ganglia are frequent concepts found in AD."
- Break condition: If the network instead learned from confounding variables (e.g., motion artifacts, scanner bias) rather than true iron-related pathology.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) can isolate and identify individual learned concepts within the CNN.
- Mechanism: CRP extends traditional backpropagation by conditioning on specific hidden-layer channels (concepts). This allows visualization of how each concept contributes to the final classification, rather than showing a single aggregated heatmap.
- Core assumption: Individual convolutional channels encode interpretable, meaningful concepts rather than random patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By applying RelMax [1], with the objective to maximize the relevance criterion, we ranked the test inputs for each concept channel."
  - [section 2.8] "CRP [1] enables conditioning on a concept encoded by a hidden-layer channel. Hence, for this analysis we computed the concept-conditional explanations for all eight channels of the last down-convolutional layer."
- Break condition: If the isolated concepts don't correspond to interpretable patterns or show no spatial consistency across different inputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The relevance-guided network architecture improves interpretability by focusing attention on brain parenchyma.
- Mechanism: The Graz+ architecture adds a relevance loss term that encourages higher relevance values within predefined brain masks (attention masks). This regularizes the network to focus on relevant brain regions rather than exploiting irrelevant image areas.
- Core assumption: Constraining relevance to brain parenchyma eliminates spurious correlations while preserving true disease-related features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4] "To guide the training process, we extended the classifier's categorical cross entropy loss (loss CCE) by a loss term to act as a regularizer: lossrelevance(R, M) = −1T vec(R ⊙ M), which enforces higher relevance values in R at positions marked by the focus region M."
  - [abstract] "To focus the classifier's attention within brain parenchyma, we applied a relevance-guided regularized network (Graz+)."
- Break condition: If the relevance constraint removes important discriminative features or if the network finds alternative ways to exploit data artifacts outside the attention mask.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantitative MRI parameter R2* and its relationship to tissue iron concentration
  - Why needed here: The study uses R2* maps as input features, and understanding this relationship is crucial for interpreting why the CNN focuses on certain brain regions
  - Quick check question: What does an increased R2* value indicate about tissue composition in the context of AD?

- Concept: Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) methodology
  - Why needed here: CRP is the key technique used to identify and visualize individual learned concepts within the CNN
  - Quick check question: How does CRP differ from standard backpropagation-based heatmapping methods?

- Concept: Relevance-guided neural network training
  - Why needed here: The Graz+ architecture uses a custom loss function to regularize relevance distribution, which is essential for understanding the model's interpretability properties
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the relevance loss term in the Graz+ architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: R2* maps (208 × 256 × 64)
  - Preprocessing: Brain mask extraction (FSL-SIENAX), R2* map computation, registration to MNI152
  - Network: 4-layer CNN with relevance guidance (Graz+)
  - Output: Classification probabilities for AD/NC
  - Analysis: CRP for concept identification, ROI analysis for validation

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocessing pipeline (brain masks → R2* computation → registration)
  2. CNN training with relevance guidance
  3. CRP computation for concept identification
  4. Validation against histological findings and ROI analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using quantitative R2* maps vs. standard T1-weighted images: Provides specific pathological information but requires more complex preprocessing
  - Relevance-guided training vs. standard training: Improves interpretability but may slightly reduce classification performance
  - Concept-based analysis vs. global heatmaps: Provides more granular insights but requires more computational resources

- Failure signatures:
  - High relevance outside brain parenchyma (attention mask not working)
  - Concepts that don't correspond to known AD pathology (network learning artifacts)
  - Poor correlation between CRP results and ROI analysis (methodological issues)
  - Low classification accuracy despite good interpretability (tradeoff between performance and explainability)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify R2* preprocessing pipeline: Check that R2* maps correctly highlight areas of known iron accumulation
  2. Test relevance guidance: Train with and without relevance loss to confirm it improves interpretability without severely harming performance
  3. Validate CRP methodology: Compare CRP-identified concepts against manually defined regions of interest to ensure consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the identified concepts in the CNN relate to specific pathophysiological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease beyond iron accumulation in the basal ganglia?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies concepts primarily in and adjacent to the basal ganglia, consistent with histological findings about iron accumulation, but questions remain about what other disease mechanisms the CNN may be learning.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on validating the CNN's learning against known histological findings but doesn't explore whether the network identifies other disease-related features or mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional analysis comparing the CNN's learned concepts with other established AD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid plaques, tau tangles, glucose metabolism patterns) or pathological changes in other brain regions would clarify whether the network captures broader disease mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How generalizable are the learned concepts across different MRI protocols, field strengths, and patient populations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study uses a specific 3T MRI protocol and a single clinical cohort, but the paper doesn't address whether the learned concepts would transfer to other imaging conditions or patient populations.
- Why unresolved: The study doesn't test the model's performance or concept consistency across different MRI acquisition parameters, field strengths (e.g., 1.5T vs 3T), or diverse patient cohorts with varying disease stages or comorbidities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the same CNN architecture on datasets with different MRI protocols, field strengths, and diverse patient populations would demonstrate the generalizability of the learned concepts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the identified concepts evolve over time as Alzheimer's disease progresses, and can they predict disease progression?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study uses cross-sectional data to identify concepts but doesn't examine how these concepts change longitudinally or whether they can predict disease progression.
- Why unresolved: The study doesn't include longitudinal analysis to track how concept relevance and spatial patterns change over time, nor does it assess whether the concepts have predictive value for disease progression or conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal analysis of R2* maps and CNN concept evolution in patients with repeated scans over time, along with clinical outcome data, would reveal whether the identified concepts can track disease progression and predict future clinical states.

## Limitations

- The study relies on Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) without validation through ablation studies or comparison with alternative XAI methods
- The interpretation that learned concepts align with pathological iron accumulation assumes R2* maps directly reflect tissue iron content, which may not hold uniformly across brain regions
- The relatively small sample size (n=226) and specific acquisition parameters limit generalizability to other clinical settings

## Confidence

- High confidence: The CNN's ability to classify AD from R2* maps with the reported accuracy metrics
- Medium confidence: The alignment between CRP-identified concepts and known AD pathology in basal ganglia
- Low confidence: The interpretability improvements specifically attributable to the relevance-guided architecture versus standard CNNs

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study comparing CRP with alternative XAI methods (LIME, SHAP) to verify concept identification accuracy
2. Validate the R2*-iron concentration relationship across different brain regions using histological correlation data
3. Test the model's performance on an independent dataset with different acquisition parameters to assess generalizability
