# EndoGS: Deformable Endoscopic Tissues Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.11535
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11535
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: EndoGS achieves 37.654 PSNR, 0.965 SSIM, and 0.036 LPIPS on DaVinci robotic surgery videos while maintaining ~40 FPS real-time rendering

## Executive Summary
EndoGS introduces a Gaussian Splatting-based approach for deformable endoscopic tissue reconstruction from single-viewpoint videos in robotic surgery. The method addresses the challenge of modeling dynamic tissue deformation while maintaining real-time performance by incorporating deformation fields, depth-guided supervision, and spatial-temporal weight masks. Unlike traditional volumetric methods like NeRF, EndoGS leverages the efficiency of Gaussian Splatting with extensions for dynamic scenes, achieving superior rendering quality and speed compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
EndoGS reconstructs deformable endoscopic tissues by initializing 3D Gaussians from stereo video frames using COLMAP, then optimizing them with a two-stage training process. The method incorporates deformation fields parameterized by time and spatial features from HexPlane encoding to model dynamic tissue motion. Depth-guided supervision uses Huber loss on estimated depth maps to provide geometric constraints, while spatial-temporal weight masks mitigate tool occlusion artifacts during optimization. The system outputs real-time rendered frames with tool masks applied, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for surgical navigation.

## Key Results
- Achieves 37.654 PSNR, 0.965 SSIM, and 0.036 LPIPS on DaVinci robotic surgery videos
- Maintains real-time rendering speed of approximately 40 FPS
- Outperforms existing methods like EndoNeRF and ForPlane in both quality and efficiency metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deformation fields enable modeling of non-rigid tissue motion while preserving Gaussian splatting efficiency
- Mechanism: EndoGS uses a lightweight MLP to predict Gaussian deformations parameterized by time and spatial features from HexPlane encoding, allowing dynamic scene representation without full volumetric optimization
- Core assumption: Time-varying tissue deformation can be approximated by a continuous deformation field acting on static Gaussian parameters
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach incorporates deformation fields to handle dynamic scenes"
  - [section 2.3] "We use introduce the Gaussian deformation to represent the time-varying motions and shapes"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - this is novel to EndoGS
- Break condition: If tissue deformation is too complex or non-smooth for MLP-based deformation prediction

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Depth-guided supervision mitigates monocular optimization limitations in single-viewpoint reconstruction
- Mechanism: EndoGS incorporates Huber loss on estimated depth maps to provide additional 3D constraints beyond appearance-based reconstruction
- Core assumption: Stereo depth estimation provides reliable geometric priors that can regularize the Gaussians' 3D positions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "depth-guided supervision to optimize 3D targets with a single viewpoint"
  - [section 2.4] "we introduce depth-guided loss with the estimated depth maps"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - this combination is specific to EndoGS
- Break condition: If estimated depth maps are inaccurate or inconsistent with appearance information

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Spatial-temporal weight masks reduce tool occlusion artifacts during optimization
- Mechanism: EndoGS applies binary tool masks combined with temporal occlusion statistics to weight the reconstruction loss, focusing optimization on visible tissue regions
- Core assumption: Tool occlusion patterns are temporally consistent and can be captured by mask statistics
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "spatial-temporal weight masks to mitigate tool occlusion"
  - [section 2.4] "We leverage spatiotemporal importance sampling strategy to indicate the crucial areas related to the occlusion issue"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - this specific weighting scheme is novel to EndoGS
- Break condition: If tool occlusion patterns are too complex or irregular for simple mask-based weighting

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D Gaussian Splatting representation and rasterization
  - Why needed here: Understanding the base representation that EndoGS builds upon for dynamic scenes
  - Quick check question: How are 3D Gaussians projected to 2D pixels for rendering?

- Concept: Dynamic scene representation techniques (NeRF vs Gaussian Splatting)
  - Why needed here: Understanding why Gaussian Splatting is preferred over NeRF for real-time surgical reconstruction
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences in optimization between dynamic NeRF and dynamic Gaussian Splatting?

- Concept: Monocular 3D reconstruction challenges and depth regularization
  - Why needed here: Understanding why depth guidance is necessary for single-viewpoint optimization
  - Quick check question: Why does monocular reconstruction suffer from overfitting compared to stereo reconstruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (stereo video frames, estimated depth maps, tool masks) → Core (static Gaussian initialization → dynamic deformation field → weighted rasterization) → Supervision (L1 appearance loss + Huber depth loss + spatial TV + temporal TV) → Output (real-time rendered frames with tool masks)

- Critical path: Video frames → Depth estimation → Gaussian initialization → Deformation prediction → Rasterization → Weighted supervision → Optimized Gaussians

- Design tradeoffs:
  - HexPlane vs other spatial encodings (tradeoff: efficiency vs expressiveness)
  - Depth regularization weight (tradeoff: geometric accuracy vs appearance fidelity)
  - Tool mask weighting (tradeoff: artifact reduction vs completeness)

- Failure signatures:
  - Blurry or inconsistent depth maps → Poor 3D geometry
  - Tool masks not aligned with actual tool positions → Artifact introduction
  - Insufficient Gaussians → Missing fine details
  - Too many Gaussians → Slow rendering, overfitting

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test static Gaussian splatting on single frame (baseline performance)
  2. Add simple time-varying deformation (validate dynamic extension)
  3. Integrate tool masks and depth regularization (validate occlusion handling)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the performance of EndoGS degrade when applied to monocular endoscopic videos without stereo depth estimates?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors use depth-guided supervision with estimated stereo depth maps and note that monocular reconstruction provides limited information and makes overfitting likely. They state this is an ill-posed problem but do not evaluate performance without depth guidance.
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states monocular reconstruction is challenging but only presents results with depth guidance, leaving the performance gap unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing EndoGS performance with and without depth guidance on the same dataset, measuring PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS degradation.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on synthetic test masks that may not fully represent real surgical scenarios
- Limited ablation study without comparisons against other established dynamic reconstruction baselines
- Method depends on accurate depth estimation, which could propagate errors through the reconstruction process

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Real-time rendering performance (~40 FPS) and PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS metrics (37.654/0.965/0.036) on the test set
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization to different surgical procedures and tissue types not represented in the DaVinci dataset
- **Medium confidence**: Robustness to varying tool occlusion patterns beyond those captured in the training masks

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test EndoGS on endoscopic videos from different surgical systems and tissue types to assess generalization beyond the DaVinci dataset
2. **Depth estimation sensitivity**: Systematically evaluate how errors in estimated depth maps affect the final reconstruction quality to understand the reliability of the depth-guided supervision
3. **Tool mask robustness**: Validate performance with manually annotated tool masks versus automatically generated ones to assess sensitivity to mask accuracy
