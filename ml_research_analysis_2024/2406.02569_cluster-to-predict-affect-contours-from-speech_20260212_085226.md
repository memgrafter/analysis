# Cluster-to-Predict Affect Contours from Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02569
- Authors: Gökhan Kuşçu; Engin Erzin
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: F1 scores of 0.84 for arousal and 0.75 for valence in four-class speech-driven affect-contour prediction model

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Cluster-to-Predict (C2P) framework for continuous emotion recognition (CER) by reformulating it as a prediction problem of dynamic affect-contour clusters from speech. The approach learns affect-contour clusters through an unsupervised iterative optimization process that minimizes both clustering loss and speech-driven affect-contour prediction loss. Using the RECOLA dataset, the proposed method achieves promising classification results with F1 scores of 0.84 for arousal and 0.75 for valence, demonstrating that the learned clusters are more predictable from speech representations than direct regression approaches.

## Method Summary
The C2P framework processes speech in 2-second windows with 1-second overlap, extracting Wav2Vec 2.0Large embeddings (1024-dim) for each frame. The AffectNet CNN extracts 8-dimensional latent representations from affect contours, which are clustered using k-means. The SpeechNet CNN learns to predict cluster labels from Wav2Vec features. Both networks are jointly optimized using a weighted sum of their classification losses (α=0.2), with training conducted for 50 epochs using Adam optimizer (lr=0.001, batch size 256). The approach transforms continuous affect values into discrete cluster labels that are more predictable from speech features.

## Key Results
- F1 score of 0.84 for arousal classification in four-class model
- F1 score of 0.75 for valence classification in four-class model
- Demonstrates superior predictability of affect-contour clusters from speech compared to direct regression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The C2P framework learns affect-contour clusters that are more predictable from speech representations by jointly optimizing clustering and prediction losses. The AffectNet extracts latent representations of affect contours, which are clustered using k-means. The SpeechNet learns to map speech features to these cluster labels. Joint optimization ensures that the clusters are shaped to be more predictable from speech. This relies on the assumption that latent affect representations can be clustered in a way that makes cluster assignments more predictable from speech features than direct regression of affect values.

### Mechanism 2
Using Wav2Vec 2.0 as a pre-trained feature extractor provides rich, contextualized speech representations that improve the predictability of affect-contour clusters. Wav2Vec 2.0 processes raw audio waveforms to produce 1024-dimensional embeddings for each 20ms frame, capturing phonetic and prosodic information relevant to emotional expression. These embeddings are processed by the SpeechCNN to predict affect-contour cluster labels. This assumes that Wav2Vec embeddings contain discriminative information for emotional attributes that can be leveraged for affect-contour cluster prediction.

### Mechanism 3
The 2-second temporal window with 1-second overlap captures sufficient context for modeling dynamic affect contours while maintaining computational efficiency. The system processes speech in 2-second windows, extracting Wav2Vec embeddings and affect contour vectors. This window size balances the need for temporal context with the need for fine-grained temporal resolution. The assumption is that 2-second windows capture enough temporal information to represent meaningful changes in affect attributes while being short enough to maintain temporal resolution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Clustering algorithms (k-means)
  - Why needed here: The C2P framework relies on k-means clustering to group latent affect representations into discrete clusters that can be predicted from speech.
  - Quick check question: What is the main objective of k-means clustering, and how does it determine cluster assignments?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks for feature extraction
  - Why needed here: Both the AffectNet and SpeechCNN use convolutional layers to extract hierarchical features from affect contours and speech representations, respectively.
  - Quick check question: How do convolutional layers capture local patterns in sequential data, and why are they effective for this task?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning and joint optimization
  - Why needed here: The C2P framework uses a semi-supervised approach where clustering (unsupervised) and prediction (supervised) are jointly optimized to improve both clustering quality and prediction accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What are the benefits of joint optimization in semi-supervised learning, and how does it differ from pre-training and fine-tuning approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wav2Vec 2.0 -> SpeechCNN -> Cluster labels; AffectNet -> Latent representations -> k-means clustering; Joint loss function
- Critical path: 1) Segment speech and affect contours into 2-second windows 2) Extract Wav2Vec embeddings for speech segments 3) Pass affect contours through AffectNet to get latent representations 4) Update k-means cluster centroids using latent representations 5) Train SpeechNet and AffectNet jointly using cluster labels
- Design tradeoffs: Window size vs. temporal resolution (2-second windows with 1-second overlap), Dimensionality of latent representations (8 dimensions), Weighting factor α (0.2)
- Failure signatures: Low classification accuracy (poor mapping from speech to affect-contour clusters), Unstable cluster assignments across epochs (insufficient clustering stability), High joint loss that doesn't decrease (optimization issues)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Vary the number of clusters (k=2 to 10) and evaluate classification performance 2) Test different latent representation dimensions (4, 8, 16) 3) Compare performance using different pre-trained feature extractors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (9.5 hours from 27 utterances) may limit generalizability
- Evaluation focuses on classification metrics without extensive comparison to direct regression approaches
- Hyperparameter choices (latent dimension, cluster count, weighting factor) appear empirical without systematic optimization

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Technical implementation details of C2P framework, Wav2Vec 2.0 feature extraction, CNN architectures, and joint optimization procedure are clearly specified and technically sound. Classification results (F1 scores of 0.84 for arousal and 0.75 for valence) are directly reported and verifiable.

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that affect-contour clusters are more predictable from speech than direct regression lacks direct comparative experiments with state-of-the-art CER methods. Effectiveness of joint optimization over separate pipelines is demonstrated but could benefit from ablation studies.

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability to other datasets and affect attributes beyond arousal and valence remains untested. Potential biases in RECOLA dataset and behavior with different affect annotation schemes are not addressed.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments comparing C2P framework against established continuous emotion recognition baselines that use direct regression to quantify the advantage of cluster-to-predict formulation.

2. Systematically evaluate the contribution of each component (Wav2Vec embeddings, joint optimization, clustering approach) through ablation studies to determine which elements are essential for performance.

3. Test the trained models on other emotional speech datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, MSP-Improv) to assess the robustness and generalizability of affect-contour cluster representations across different recording conditions and annotation schemes.
