# Fairness-Aware Job Scheduling for Multi-Job Federated Learning

## Quick Facts

- Addresses fair job scheduling in multi-job federated learning environments using Lyapunov optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of fair job scheduling in multi-job federated learning where multiple FL servers compete for access to shared client datasets. The authors propose FairFedJS, a Lyapunov optimization-based approach that jointly optimizes scheduling fairness and system revenue by considering both current demand and job payment bids. The method introduces a virtual queue mechanism to track dataset demand and a Job Scheduling Index that combines queue length, payment, and client reliability to rank jobs. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in scheduling fairness and convergence speed compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed FairFedJS approach uses Lyapunov optimization to address the joint optimization problem of scheduling fairness and system revenue in multi-job federated learning environments. The method introduces a virtual queue mechanism to track dataset demand across jobs and calculates a Job Scheduling Index (JSI) that combines queue length, payment bids, and client reliability metrics. This index determines job priority for accessing shared client datasets. The optimization framework dynamically adjusts job scheduling based on current system state while ensuring long-term fairness guarantees through the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty technique.

## Key Results
- Achieves 31.9% lower scheduling unfairness compared to the best baseline
- Provides 1.0% faster convergence speed while maintaining comparable test accuracy
- Enables jobs to adjust payments to improve scheduling priority and ensures fair allocation of high-demand client datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming the scheduling problem into a Lyapunov optimization framework that balances immediate system revenue against long-term fairness objectives. The virtual queue mechanism tracks dataset demand over time, creating a buffer that smooths scheduling decisions and prevents starvation of low-paying jobs. The Job Scheduling Index combines multiple factors - queue length (representing demand), payment bids (representing revenue potential), and client reliability (representing training quality) - into a single metric that guides scheduling decisions. This multi-factor approach ensures that both economic efficiency and fairness considerations are balanced in real-time scheduling decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Lyapunov Optimization**: Needed for transforming complex scheduling problems into tractable optimization frameworks; quick check: verify stability conditions are satisfied in the virtual queue system
- **Federated Learning**: Needed as the core distributed learning paradigm being scheduled; quick check: ensure FL model updates are correctly aggregated across clients
- **Queue Theory**: Needed for modeling dataset demand and job waiting times; quick check: validate queue stability and boundedness properties
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Needed for handling multiple competing FL servers; quick check: confirm proper coordination mechanisms between agents
- **Payment-Based Priority**: Needed for introducing economic incentives into scheduling; quick check: verify payment mechanisms don't create unfair advantages for high-budget jobs

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Virtual Queue System -> Lyapunov Optimization Engine -> Job Scheduling Index Calculator -> FL Server Coordinator -> Client Dataset Allocator

### Critical Path
Job arrival → Queue update → JSI calculation → Scheduling decision → Model training → Result aggregation → Queue update

### Design Tradeoffs
The payment-based priority system introduces economic flexibility but may disadvantage smaller organizations. The virtual queue approach adds computational overhead but provides better fairness guarantees. The multi-factor JSI balances multiple objectives but increases decision complexity. The Lyapunov optimization ensures long-term stability but requires careful parameter tuning.

### Failure Signatures
Queue instability leading to job starvation, payment manipulation attacks where jobs artificially inflate bids, convergence degradation due to poor scheduling decisions, and client reliability misestimation causing suboptimal job assignments.

### First 3 Experiments
1. Baseline comparison with single-job FL scheduling to quantify multi-job overhead
2. Stress test with varying payment distributions to evaluate fairness under economic pressure
3. Scalability test with increasing client and job counts to measure performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on relatively small-scale datasets (Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10) with 50 clients and 10 FL servers
- Assumes independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data across clients
- Payment-based priority mechanism may create economic barriers for smaller organizations
- Does not address potential privacy concerns from virtual queue tracking across multiple jobs

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical framework and mathematical foundations are well-defined and sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results are credible within tested scenarios but may not generalize to larger systems
- **Medium Confidence**: Payment-based priority mechanism shows effectiveness but practical implications require further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FairFedJS performance on larger-scale federated learning systems with 1000+ clients and non-i.i.d. data distributions
2. Conduct extensive testing across diverse dataset types beyond image classification to validate generalization
3. Implement real-world deployment in a controlled multi-tenant federated learning environment to measure actual economic impacts and fairness outcomes
