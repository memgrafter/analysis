# A Hybrid Filtering for Micro-video Hashtag Recommendation using Graph-based Deep Neural Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10367
- Reference count: 14
- Proposes a hybrid filtering approach for micro-video hashtag recommendation using graph-based deep neural networks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MISHON, a hybrid filtering approach for hashtag recommendation on micro-videos that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The method leverages a graph-based deep neural network to model complex interactions between users and multimodal content (visual, acoustic, textual). By constructing an interaction graph and applying GraphSAGE for feature refinement, the model captures semantic information and enriches micro-video representations. The approach also addresses the cold-start user problem through a social influence and content-based technique that recommends hashtags based on influential users' behavior.

## Method Summary
The MISHON framework consists of three main components: feature mining, feature refinement, and hashtag recommendation. First, modality-specific features are extracted using pre-trained models (Vision Transformer for visual, wav2vec2.0 for acoustic, and BERT for textual content). An attention mechanism is then applied to each modality to identify and emphasize the most relevant features for hashtag recommendation. The refined modality representations are used to construct an interaction graph with four node types (visual, acoustic, textual modalities, and users) and seven edge types. GraphSAGE is employed to propagate and aggregate information through the graph, refining both modality and user embeddings. Finally, the refined representations are combined and passed through a dense layer with softmax activation to predict relevant hashtags. For cold-start users, a social influence technique recommends hashtags based on the behavior of popular users with high engagement rates.

## Key Results
- MISHON achieves relative improvements of 3.6%, 2.8%, and 6.5% in F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods on TMALL, INSVIDEO, and YFCC datasets respectively
- The social influence and content-based technique for cold-start users shows a relative improvement of 15.8% in F1-score over content-only approaches
- The model demonstrates consistent performance across different datasets, validating its generalizability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The graph-based deep neural network effectively captures and refines modality-specific and user representations by modeling user-to-user, modality-to-modality, and user-to-modality interactions. By constructing a graph with four types of nodes (visual, acoustic, textual modalities, and users) and seven types of edges, the model uses GraphSAGE to propagate and aggregate information from neighboring nodes, thereby enriching the embeddings. Core assumption: The interactions between nodes in the graph are meaningful and can be used to improve the representation of each node.

### Mechanism 2
The attention mechanism filters out noisy information and highlights the most relevant features in each modality for hashtag recommendation. The attention mechanism assigns weights to each unit in the modality-specific features based on their importance for hashtag recommendation, and the weighted sum is used to obtain an enriched representation. Core assumption: Certain features in each modality are more important than others for determining the relevance of hashtags.

### Mechanism 3
The social influence technique effectively addresses the cold-start user problem by recommending hashtags based on the behavior of influential users. The model identifies popular users based on their engagement rate and recommends hashtags used by these users to cold-start users, assuming that new users will mimic the behavior of popular users to gain social attention. Core assumption: Cold-start users are likely to use hashtags similar to those used by popular users in order to increase their content's visibility.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: To model complex interactions between users and micro-video modalities and learn informative node embeddings
  - Quick check question: What is the key operation in a GNN that allows it to aggregate information from neighboring nodes?

- **Concept**: Attention Mechanisms
  - Why needed here: To filter out noisy information and highlight the most relevant features in each modality for hashtag recommendation
  - Quick check question: How does an attention mechanism determine the importance of each feature in a representation?

- **Concept**: Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: To leverage pre-trained models (ViT for visual features, Wav2Vec2.0 for acoustic features, BERT for textual features) to extract meaningful representations from each modality
  - Quick check question: What are the benefits of using pre-trained models for feature extraction compared to training from scratch?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Feature mining (pre-trained models + attention) -> Graph construction (4 node types, 7 edge types) -> Feature refinement (GraphSAGE) -> Hashtag recommendation (dense layer + softmax)
- **Critical path**: Input micro-video and user -> Extract modality features -> Apply attention -> Construct interaction graph -> Refine embeddings with GraphSAGE -> Combine representations -> Predict hashtags
- **Design tradeoffs**: The model trades off computational complexity for improved performance by using GNNs and attention mechanisms. The social influence technique adds complexity but addresses the cold-start problem.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on cold-start users, failure to capture modality-specific nuances, or inability to generalize to new datasets
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation study: Remove the attention mechanism and evaluate the impact on performance
  2. Edge construction sensitivity: Vary the thresholds for edge construction and evaluate the impact on performance
  3. Cold-start user analysis: Compare the performance of the social influence technique to a content-only baseline for cold-start users

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed model compare when using different aggregation functions (e.g., mean, max, min, sum, product) in the GraphSAGE framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the authors experimented with various aggregation functions, including mean, max, min, sum, and product, and found that the mean aggregator function performed the best, with improvements ranging from 0.1-1.5% in hit rate, 0.0-0.5% in precision, 0.6-2.1% in recall, and 0.1-0.7% in F1-score over other functions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance differences between the aggregation functions, and it is unclear how much each function contributes to the overall performance of the model.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more detailed analysis of the performance of each aggregation function, including visualizations of the performance differences, would help to resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed model handle the cold-start user problem when there is no historical interaction data available for the user?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a social influence and content-based technique to address the cold-start user problem, which involves modeling the interaction of cold-start users with influential users and discovering popular hashtagging trends.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the model handles the cold-start user problem when there is no historical interaction data available for the user, and it is unclear how effective this approach is in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more detailed explanation of the social influence and content-based technique, including examples of how it works in practice, would help to resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed model handle the temporal sensitivity of micro-videos and hashtags?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper does not explicitly address the temporal sensitivity of micro-videos and hashtags, but it does mention that micro-videos are "topical and temporally sensitive," implying that the relevance of hashtags associated with a given micro-video can evolve over time.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the model handles the temporal sensitivity of micro-videos and hashtags, and it is unclear how effective this approach is in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more detailed explanation of how the model handles the temporal sensitivity of micro-videos and hashtags, including examples of how it works in practice, would help to resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks sensitivity analysis for graph construction thresholds, which significantly impact model performance
- The social influence technique's assumptions about cold-start user behavior are not empirically validated
- No ablation studies are provided to quantify the individual contribution of each model component

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of using pre-trained models for feature extraction (Vision Transformer, wav2vec2.0, BERT) and the general framework of multimodal graph construction
- **Medium confidence**: The attention mechanism's effectiveness in filtering relevant features and the overall performance improvements (3.6-6.5% F1-score improvements), as these are demonstrated but lack ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: The social influence technique's assumptions about cold-start user behavior and the specific threshold values for graph construction

## Next Checks

1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on graph construction thresholds by varying the cosine similarity (0.6-0.9) and Jaccard similarity (0.3-0.7) parameters to identify optimal values and demonstrate robustness to threshold selection.

2. Perform ablation studies systematically removing components (attention mechanism, graph refinement, social influence) to quantify each component's contribution to the reported performance improvements.

3. Validate the social influence assumptions by comparing engagement rate against alternative influence metrics (follower count, retweet ratio, hashtag adoption velocity) and testing whether cold-start users actually mimic popular users' hashtag usage patterns through qualitative analysis of recommendation outcomes.
