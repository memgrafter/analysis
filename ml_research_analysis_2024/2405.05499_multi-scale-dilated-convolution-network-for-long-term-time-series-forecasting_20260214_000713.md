# Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution Network for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.05499
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05499
- Authors: Feifei Li; Suhan Guo; Feng Han; Jian Zhao; Furao Shen
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: MSDCN achieves up to 12.9% improvement in MSE over TimesNet and 9.4% over NLinear while being approximately 400 times faster than TimesNet

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MSDCN, a novel architecture for long-term time series forecasting that combines multi-scale dilated convolutions with an autoregressive module. The method uses exponentially growing dilation rates and varying kernel sizes to capture temporal dependencies at multiple scales without information loss from downsampling. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show MSDCN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and inference speed, achieving significant improvements in MSE and MAE metrics across various prediction lengths.

## Method Summary
MSDCN employs dilated convolutions with exponentially growing dilation rates and varying kernel sizes to extract multi-scale temporal features from time series data. The architecture uses two distinct convolutional modules with different kernel sizes to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies, which are then fused using learned weights. An autoregressive module captures linear relationships, and the final prediction is the sum of both components. The model is trained using Huber loss and Adam optimizer, and demonstrates significant inference speed improvements over competing approaches.

## Key Results
- MSDCN achieves up to 12.9% improvement in MSE over TimesNet and 9.4% over NLinear on benchmark datasets
- The model demonstrates inference speed improvements of approximately 400x compared to TimesNet and 17x compared to Autoformer
- Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the multi-scale convolutional and autoregressive modules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-scale dilated convolutions enable the network to capture temporal dependencies at multiple resolutions without losing information through downsampling.
- Mechanism: Dilated convolutions with exponentially growing dilation rates and varying kernel sizes allow the network to sample time series data at different scales. Larger dilations capture long-term dependencies, while smaller dilations capture short-term patterns.
- Core assumption: Time series data contain periodic and trend components at multiple scales that can be effectively captured through dilated convolutions with exponentially growing dilations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "We design different convolution blocks with exponentially growing dilations and varying kernel sizes to sample time series data at different scales."
- Break condition: If the time series lacks clear multi-scale periodic structure, or if the exponential dilation schedule doesn't align with the actual data frequencies, the multi-scale extraction becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining convolutional and autoregressive modules captures both non-linear and linear dependencies in time series data.
- Mechanism: The convolutional module extracts complex non-linear temporal patterns through multi-scale feature extraction, while the autoregressive module directly models linear relationships. The final prediction is the sum of both components.
- Core assumption: Time series data contain both linear and non-linear relationships that benefit from separate modeling approaches.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Furthermore, we utilize traditional autoregressive model to capture the linear relationships within the data."
- Break condition: If the time series is predominantly either linear or non-linear, one module may dominate or interfere with the other's effectiveness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The two-level convolution structure (long-term and short-term) provides complementary feature extraction that improves forecasting accuracy.
- Mechanism: The model uses two distinct convolutional modules with different kernel sizes - one for long-term dependencies and one for short-term dependencies. These features are fused using learned weights.
- Core assumption: Different forecasting tasks benefit from different balances of short-term and long-term information, and this balance varies across datasets.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "We design different convolution blocks with exponentially growing dilations and varying kernel sizes to sample time series data at different scales."
- Break condition: If the dataset's temporal patterns don't benefit from explicit separation of long and short-term features, or if the learned fusion weights consistently favor one module, the two-level structure may be unnecessary complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dilated convolutions and receptive field expansion
  - Why needed here: Understanding how dilated convolutions work is critical to grasping how MSDCN captures multi-scale temporal features without losing information through downsampling.
  - Quick check question: How does a dilated convolution with dilation rate 2 differ from a standard convolution in terms of the input positions it considers?

- Concept: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonality, and noise
  - Why needed here: MSDCN's multi-scale approach implicitly performs decomposition, so understanding traditional decomposition methods helps explain why this approach is effective.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components typically found in time series decomposition, and how might each be captured at different scales?

- Concept: Linear vs non-linear time series relationships
  - Why needed here: The model combines autoregressive (linear) and convolutional (non-linear) components, so understanding when each type of relationship dominates is important for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What are some examples of time series patterns that would be better captured by linear models versus non-linear models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Normalization → [Long conv module + Short conv module] → Fusion → FFN → Autoregressive → Sum → Output

- Critical path: Input normalization layer → Long-term convolutional module (larger kernels, exponentially growing dilations) → Short-term convolutional module (smaller kernels, exponentially growing dilations) → Feature fusion layer (learned weights) → Feed-forward neural network layer → Autoregressive module (linear transformation) → Output layer (sum of conv and autoregressive outputs)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shallow vs deep architecture: MSDCN uses shallow convolutions for efficiency vs deeper networks that might capture more complex patterns but are slower
  - Multi-scale vs single-scale: Multi-scale captures more patterns but adds complexity and parameters
  - Linear + non-linear vs pure non-linear: Combining approaches captures both types of relationships but adds implementation complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with simple patterns (overfitting to complexity)
  - Sensitivity to dilation schedule not matching data frequencies
  - Autoregressive module dominating or being dominated by convolutional module
  - Performance degradation on very short time series (insufficient context)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare MSDCN with only convolutional module vs only autoregressive module on a dataset to quantify each component's contribution
  2. Test different dilation schedules (linear vs exponential growth) to find optimal configuration
  3. Evaluate performance on datasets with known multi-scale structure vs datasets with single-scale patterns to validate multi-scale effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The multi-scale approach relies heavily on the assumption that time series contain clear periodic and trend components at multiple scales, which may not hold for all real-world datasets
- The fixed exponential dilation schedule may not optimally align with the actual frequency structure of different time series
- Training efficiency comparisons are not provided, only inference speed improvements are discussed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The empirical results showing MSDCN's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets are well-supported by the experimental data and ablation studies.
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical justification for combining convolutional and autoregressive modules is reasonable but lacks extensive mathematical grounding for why this specific combination is optimal.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that the two-level convolution structure provides complementary feature extraction is primarily supported by performance improvements rather than direct interpretability analysis of what each module actually learns.

## Next Checks
1. **Dilation schedule sensitivity**: Systematically test different dilation rate progressions (linear, exponential, adaptive) across the benchmark datasets to determine if the exponential schedule is optimal or if performance varies significantly with different schedules.

2. **Module contribution analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments isolating the convolutional module from the autoregressive module on datasets with known linear vs non-linear characteristics to quantify each component's actual contribution to forecasting accuracy.

3. **Generalization to shorter series**: Evaluate MSDCN's performance on time series with varying lengths, particularly focusing on cases where the input window is shorter than the effective receptive field, to identify the minimum required context for the multi-scale approach to be effective.
