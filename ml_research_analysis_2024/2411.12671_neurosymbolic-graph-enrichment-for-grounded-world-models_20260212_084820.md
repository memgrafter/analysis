- The paper introduces a neurosymbolic method to enhance LLM reactive capabilities by integrating structured semantic representations with multimodal inputs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a neurosymbolic approach that enhances large language models' reactive capabilities by integrating structured semantic representations with multimodal inputs. The system transforms images into natural language descriptions, converts them into Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs, and enriches these with knowledge from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. Through iterative graph extensions using 11 heuristics covering presuppositions, implicatures, causal relations, and moral values, the system creates a multimodal, knowledge-augmented formal representation. The approach bridges the gap between unstructured language models and formal semantic structures, enabling more comprehensive understanding of complex real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
The neurosymbolic pipeline begins with multimodal input processing, where images are converted to natural language descriptions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These descriptions are then transformed into Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs, which serve as the semantic backbone. The system enriches these graphs through iterative extensions using 11 carefully designed heuristics that incorporate linguistic knowledge from WordNet and factual knowledge from Wikidata. The heuristics cover various semantic dimensions including presuppositions, implicatures, causal relations, and moral values. The enriched AMR graphs are evaluated for plausibility through human judgment and validated against foundational ontologies to ensure logical integrity and semantic coherence.

## Key Results
- High plausibility ratings (mean > 3 on a 5-point scale) across most heuristics
- Strong logical integrity and foundational ontology alignment
- Effective bridging of unstructured language models and formal semantic structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its multi-layered approach to semantic enrichment. By starting with image-to-text conversion, it grounds abstract representations in concrete visual inputs. The AMR graph structure provides a formal, interpretable semantic framework that captures meaning beyond surface-level text. The 11 heuristics systematically extend this representation by incorporating different types of semantic knowledge - from basic linguistic relationships to complex inferential patterns. The iterative enrichment process allows the system to build progressively richer representations that capture nuances often missed by standard language models. The validation against foundational ontologies ensures that the enriched representations maintain logical consistency and real-world applicability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)**: A semantic formalism that represents sentence meaning as directed acyclic graphs, needed for formal semantic representation and quick check: can be visualized as graphs with nodes for concepts and edges for relations
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: AI systems that process both visual and textual inputs, needed for multimodal grounding and quick check: should produce coherent text descriptions from images
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Structured representations of facts and relationships, needed for semantic enrichment and quick check: consist of entities connected by typed relations
- **Heuristics for Semantic Enrichment**: Rule-based inference patterns for extending semantic representations, needed for systematic knowledge augmentation and quick check: should produce plausible semantic extensions
- **Ontological Alignment**: Process of mapping representations to formal ontologies, needed for logical consistency validation and quick check: should maintain semantic coherence across different representation levels
- **Human Plausibility Assessment**: Evaluation method using human judgment, needed for validating semantic quality and quick check: should show consistent ratings across different evaluators

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image -> VLM -> Text Description -> AMR Converter -> Base AMR Graph -> 11 Heuristics -> Enriched AMR Graph -> Human Evaluation -> Ontological Validation

**Critical Path**: The most time-sensitive sequence is Image processing through VLM conversion to text description, as this initial step grounds all subsequent semantic processing. Any delay or error here propagates through the entire pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes semantic richness over computational efficiency, using multiple knowledge sources and iterative enrichment. This increases accuracy but also computational cost and potential for error propagation. The reliance on human evaluation for plausibility introduces subjectivity but ensures semantic quality.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor image descriptions from VLM lead to weak base AMR graphs
- Heuristic conflicts create semantically inconsistent graphs
- Over-enrichment produces implausible semantic extensions
- Ontological misalignment indicates logical inconsistencies
- Low inter-rater agreement in human evaluation suggests ambiguity

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test single heuristic application on simple image descriptions to verify basic enrichment functionality
2. Validate AMR conversion accuracy using known sentence-to-graph mappings
3. Measure human agreement rates on plausibility ratings for baseline cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relied heavily on human judgment, introducing potential subjectivity and bias
- The 11 heuristics may not capture all forms of semantic inference needed for complex reasoning
- Performance with languages other than English remains untested, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation and basic functionality
- Medium confidence in evaluation results due to subjective human ratings and limited test cases
- Medium confidence in claims about bridging unstructured and formal representations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct double-blind human evaluation where annotators are unaware of system output versus ground truth to measure inter-rater reliability and potential bias
2. Test system performance across multiple languages using parallel AMR datasets to assess cross-linguistic robustness
3. Implement systematic stress testing with adversarial inputs designed to challenge each of the 11 heuristics, measuring failure rates and identifying edge cases where enrichment logic breaks down
