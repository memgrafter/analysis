# Online Learning Of Expanding Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08660
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08660
- Reference count: 40
- Online algorithm for expanding graph topology inference with sub-100ms per time instant performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of online network topology inference for expanding graphs where nodes join over time. The authors propose a projected proximal gradient descent algorithm that handles growing graph dimensions through recursive covariance updates with different strategies for new and existing nodes. The method specializes in Gaussian Markov random fields and demonstrates effectiveness on both controlled and real-world datasets, including COVID-19 and financial networks.

## Method Summary
The approach uses projected proximal gradient descent to minimize a loss function linking graph structure to observed signals. A key innovation is the recursive covariance update strategy that employs zero-padding and mask-based updates to handle expanding graph dimensions. The algorithm maintains different update strategies for blocks corresponding to existing nodes versus new nodes, enabling efficient adaptation to topology changes while preserving continuity for stable connections.

## Key Results
- Algorithm recovers graph topology after new nodes join by leveraging zero-padding and mask-based updates
- Achieves running times of 2.5 to 91 milliseconds per time instant depending on iterations
- Maintains performance close to offline solutions while requiring only a few iterations per new sample
- Demonstrates effectiveness on controlled data and real-world COVID-19 and financial network datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The online algorithm recovers graph topology even after new nodes join by leveraging zero-padding and different update strategies for existing and new nodes.
- Mechanism: The algorithm maintains a growing covariance matrix by zero-padding to match dimensions when new nodes arrive. It uses mask-based updates (M1, M2) that apply different forgetting factors to blocks corresponding to existing nodes (γ1) and new nodes ((1−γ)), enabling faster adaptation for new nodes while preserving continuity for existing ones.
- Core assumption: The graph topology evolves smoothly over time, with existing nodes maintaining stable connectivity while new nodes establish connections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We leverage zero-padding to keep track of Ĉt in an expanding fashion... Masks M1 and M2 help in using different update strategies for the blocks in Ĉt related to new nodes and the blocks related to previously existing nodes."
  - [abstract] "We introduce a strategy that enables different types of updates for nodes that just joined the network and for previously existing nodes."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The projected proximal gradient descent approach enables efficient topology inference with low computational complexity.
- Mechanism: The algorithm performs a proximal gradient step with ℓ1 regularization for sparsity, projecting onto the feasible set SNt at each iteration. This combines gradient descent on the smooth part of the objective with proximal operator for the non-smooth ℓ1 norm, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional graphs.
- Core assumption: The loss function linking graph structure to observed signals is differentiable, and the proximal operator for ℓ1 norm can be computed efficiently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We now propose an online algorithm based on PPG descent, a well-established method for minimizing non-smooth functions such as the ℓ1 norm present in our objective function."
  - [section] "The proximal operator of the ℓ1 norm is the soft-thresholding operator, which can be computed entry-wise as Tλ(Zij) = max{|Zij| − λ, 0}sign(Zij) for some matrix Z."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The algorithm tracks dynamic graph changes with bounded cumulative regret, ensuring convergence as the number of samples grows.
- Mechanism: The dynamic cumulative regret bound shows that the tracking error depends on the path length of the optimal solution sequence, which captures how much the graph topology changes over time. The bound ensures that if changes are sub-linear, the average error converges to zero.
- Core assumption: The optimal graph solutions change smoothly over time, and the step size η is chosen appropriately (η ≤ ϵ²).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Theorem 1 asserts that the ability of Algorithm 1 to track the dynamic and expanding topology depends on the evolution of the optimal solution to (12), given by PTt=2 ‖S*t − S*⌊Nt⌋t−1‖F."
  - [section] "As T → ∞, Theorem 1 guarantees that if the sum of the variations in S*t is sub-linear in time, then 1/T PTt=1 ‖Ŝt − S*t‖F → 0."

  - Why needed here: The algorithm maintains an expanding covariance matrix that must be updated recursively as new nodes join, requiring understanding of different update strategies for stationary vs non-stationary settings.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the rank-one correction update and the exponential decay update for covariance matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Covariance update module -> Projected proximal gradient descent engine -> Convex combination layer -> Loss function interface -> Projection operator

- Critical path: Covariance update → Gradient computation → Proximal step → Convex combination → Output estimate

- Design tradeoffs: Number of iterations per time instant vs computational cost and tracking accuracy; choice of forgetting factor for new vs existing nodes

- Failure signatures: Accumulation of tracking error when new nodes arrive frequently; poor adaptation when graph changes are abrupt rather than smooth

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-node addition test: Start with 100-node graph, add one node, verify algorithm recovers connections
  2. Batch addition test: Add multiple nodes simultaneously, measure recovery time and accuracy
  3. Dynamic topology test: Introduce controlled topology changes over time, evaluate tracking error and cumulative regret

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of online expanding graph learning scale with the number of incoming nodes and their connectivity patterns in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how the frequency of incoming nodes affects the quality of the online algorithm, but real-world datasets are limited in scope.
- Why unresolved: Real-world data often has complex connectivity patterns that may not be fully captured by controlled experiments, and the scalability of the algorithm to large networks with diverse connectivity remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on large-scale real-world networks with varying numbers of incoming nodes and diverse connectivity patterns would provide insights into the algorithm's scalability and robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed online algorithm handle scenarios where the connectivity of existing nodes changes significantly over time, not just the addition of new nodes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes that the connectivity of existing nodes changes smoothly over time, but this assumption may not hold in all real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The algorithm's performance in scenarios with significant changes in existing node connectivity is not explicitly tested, leaving its adaptability to such changes unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets where existing node connectivity changes significantly over time would demonstrate the algorithm's ability to adapt to such changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of the distance metric d(·, ·) in the objective function affect the quality of the estimated graph topology in online expanding graph learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that different distance metrics can be used to capture prior knowledge about the evolution of the graph, but the impact of this choice on performance is not explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of different distance metrics, leaving the optimal choice for various scenarios unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of different distance metrics on both synthetic and real-world datasets would reveal their impact on the quality of the estimated graph topology.

1. **Scaling Experiment:** Implement the algorithm for graphs with 1000+ nodes and measure runtime and tracking accuracy as the number of iterations per time instant scales. Compare against the claimed 2.5-91ms per time instant range.

2. **Robustness Test:** Introduce abrupt topology changes (e.g., random rewiring of connections) and measure the algorithm's ability to recover. Compare tracking error against the smooth evolution assumption.

3. **Alternative Signal Models:** Replace the Gaussian Markov random field assumption with alternative graph signal models (e.g., graph filter outputs) and evaluate whether the algorithm maintains effectiveness or requires modification.
