# Noise Filtering Benchmark for Neuromorphic Satellites Observations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.11233
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11233
- **Reference count**: 40
- **One-line primary result**: Learning-based noise filtering algorithms outperform logical approaches in preserving satellite signals while removing noise in event-based observations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of noise filtering for event-based satellite observations using Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). The authors propose two novel algorithms - CrossConv (logical-based) and FEAST (learning-based) - and benchmark them against 11 state-of-the-art methods using a new high-resolution satellite dataset with ground truth annotations. Results demonstrate that learning-based approaches significantly outperform logical methods in maintaining signal preservation while effectively removing noise, with FEAST achieving the highest ROC/AUC and denoising accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study introduces the Ev-Satellites dataset containing 100 event files (30 seconds each) from an Astrosite observatory with ground truth labels for satellites, stars, hot pixels, and background noise. Two novel algorithms are proposed: CrossConv uses spatial convolution kernels to identify and remove high-firing-rate noise pixels, while FEAST employs spiking neuron-like units with adaptive selection thresholds to learn spatiotemporal features. Both algorithms are benchmarked against 11 state-of-the-art noise filtering methods using ROC curves and metrics including Signal Retain (SR), Noise Removal (NR), Denoise Accuracy (DA), and Hot Pixel Removal (HPR).

## Key Results
- FEAST algorithm achieves the highest ROC/AUC and denoising accuracy across all tested algorithms
- CrossConv excels in hot pixel removal but is less effective at background noise filtering
- Learning-based methods outperform logical approaches in preserving sparse satellite signals while removing noise
- Optimal performance requires larger window sizes (20 seconds) compared to traditional star filtering applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CrossConv removes high-firing-rate noise and hot pixels while preserving sparse satellite events.
- Mechanism: Applies four spatial convolution kernels to accumulated event image, divides by maximum-intensity image to amplify signal-noise variance, then thresholds to isolate and remove noise pixels.
- Core assumption: Hot pixels and high-noise regions have significantly higher firing rates than sparse satellite signals.
- Evidence anchors: Section describing CrossConv algorithm implementation and abstract mentioning convolution kernel approach.
- Break condition: If satellite signals have high-density regions or glinting occurs, they may be misclassified as noise.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FEAST learns discriminative spatiotemporal features to classify signal vs. noise events in sparse scenes.
- Mechanism: Uses spiking neuron-like units with adaptive selection thresholds to extract event contexts, updates weights via Hebbian learning, and classifies events based on trained templates.
- Core assumption: Signal and noise events have distinguishable spatiotemporal patterns learnable from training data.
- Evidence anchors: Section detailing FEAST's exponentially decaying time surface kernel and abstract describing spiking neuron units.
- Break condition: If noise characteristics change significantly between training and deployment, performance degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adding linear classifier to FEAST improves hot pixel removal while maintaining signal preservation.
- Mechanism: FEAST+C uses same trained weight matrices, constructs feature map, downsamples active regions, applies max-pooling, and uses linear classifier with OPIUM to distinguish events.
- Core assumption: Learned FEAST features are linearly separable for signal vs. noise classification.
- Evidence anchors: Section describing FEAST+Classifier implementation and abstract mentioning linear classifier addition.
- Break condition: If feature space is not linearly separable, linear classifier underperforms compared to nonlinear methods.

## Foundational Learning

- **Event-based cameras and DVS pixel operation**: Understanding how DVS sensors generate events asynchronously is essential for interpreting noise characteristics and filtering effectiveness.
  - Quick check: What triggers an event in a DVS pixel, and how is polarity encoded?

- **ROC curves and binary classification metrics**: Evaluating noise filtering algorithms requires understanding TPR, FPR, and AUC trade-offs between signal preservation and noise removal.
  - Quick check: How does varying classification threshold affect ROC curve?

- **Hebbian learning and adaptive thresholds in spiking neural networks**: FEAST's learning mechanism relies on weight updates and threshold adaptation central to distinguishing signal from noise.
  - Quick check: What is FEAST's neuron weight update rule, and how do thresholds adapt during learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Event stream → accumulation → filtering (CrossConv/FEAST/FEAST+C) → evaluation
- **Critical path**: 1) Load event stream and ground truth labels 2) Run filtering algorithm with optimal parameters 3) Compute evaluation metrics and ROC curve 4) Compare against baselines
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - CrossConv: Fast, lightweight, excels at hot pixel removal, less effective at background noise
  - FEAST: Higher accuracy, learning-based, requires training data and more computation
  - FEAST+C: Best overall performance, adds complexity and memory overhead
- **Failure signatures**: High false positives (noise as signal), high false negatives (signal as noise), inconsistent performance across recordings
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run CrossConv on sample event file, vary threshold, plot ROC curve, compute SR/NR/HPR
  2. Train FEAST on 50% dataset, test on 50%, compare AUC with CrossConv
  3. Implement FEAST+C, train with same features, evaluate hot pixel removal vs. signal retention

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal window size for noise filtering in extremely sparse event-based satellite observations?
- Basis: Paper discusses window size effects finding logical algorithms improve with larger windows while IETS, STCF, and YNoise decrease.

- What evidence would resolve: Successful neuromorphic hardware implementation and benchmarking demonstrating real-time performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between DVS bias settings and noise filtering performance in low-light conditions?
- Basis: Paper notes bias settings affect signal clarity and noise performance depends on illumination and user settings.
- Why unresolved: Acknowledges importance but lacks systematic studies on bias configurations.
- What evidence would resolve: Comprehensive experiments varying bias settings across different light conditions and noise levels.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can noise filtering algorithms better distinguish between very faint stars and background noise?
- Basis: Paper notes differentiating faint stars from noise is challenging at higher limiting magnitudes.
- Why unresolved: Focused on satellite events for evaluation, acknowledging faint stars blend with noise.
- What evidence would resolve: Development and validation of algorithms effectively separating faint stellar events from background noise.

## Limitations

- Small dataset size (100 event files, 30 seconds each) may not capture full variability of observation conditions
- Ground truth labeling framework relies on assumptions about event clustering that may introduce errors
- Evaluation metrics don't fully capture temporal continuity of satellite tracks or impact on downstream tracking algorithms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: CrossConv's effectiveness in hot pixel removal and general superiority of learning-based methods
- **Medium Confidence**: FEAST algorithm's overall performance claims given small dataset size and potential overfitting
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods due to unspecified baseline implementations

## Next Checks

1. Test CrossConv and FEAST algorithms on event streams from different DVS sensors or varying noise conditions to assess generalizability beyond Ev-Satellites dataset.

2. Implement temporal consistency check by measuring filtering impact on satellite track continuity using simple tracker before/after filtering.

3. Conduct ablation studies on FEAST by varying neuron count, context window size, and training set size to identify sensitivity to architectural choices.
