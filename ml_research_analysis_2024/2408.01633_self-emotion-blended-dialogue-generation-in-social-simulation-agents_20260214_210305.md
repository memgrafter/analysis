# Self-Emotion Blended Dialogue Generation in Social Simulation Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.01633
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01633
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Incorporating self-emotion improves naturalness and humanness of LLM-generated dialogues in social simulation agents

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for incorporating self-emotion (emotional states stemming from life events outside the conversation) into dialogue generation for social simulation agents. The framework allows agents to experience events and emotional states before engaging in conversations or group discussions. Through experiments using GPT-4 and fine-tuned FLAN-T5 models, the study demonstrates that self-emotion significantly influences dialogue strategy selection and decision-making processes, with approximately 50-66% of decisions changing in group discussions when agents have negative self-emotions.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a framework where agents first experience life events that generate self-emotion states, then use these emotional states to inform their dialogue strategies and decision-making during conversations. The framework was tested through two main scenarios: a birthday party planning task and a museum visit planning task. Both GPT-4 and fine-tuned FLAN-T5 models were employed to generate agent dialogues. The evaluation involved human assessors rating the naturalness and humanness of the generated dialogues, comparing outputs with and without self-emotion consideration.

## Key Results
- Self-emotion incorporation improved the naturalness and humanness of generated dialogues
- GPT-4 and fine-tuned FLAN-T5 models produced more human-like dialogue strategies when considering self-emotion
- In group discussions, self-emotion significantly altered decision-making, with approximately 50-66% of decisions changing
- Negative self-emotion states had the most pronounced effect on decision outcomes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on grounding agent behavior in temporally and contextually relevant emotional states. By having agents process life events before dialogue engagement, the framework creates a more coherent internal state that naturally influences communication patterns, topic selection, and decision priorities. This temporal sequencing of emotional processing followed by social interaction mimics human conversational dynamics where prior experiences shape current interactions.

## Foundational Learning

**Emotional State Modeling**
- *Why needed*: Provides agents with psychological depth beyond surface-level responses
- *Quick check*: Can the agent maintain consistent emotional tone across multiple exchanges?

**Event-to-Emotion Translation**
- *Why needed*: Bridges the gap between external stimuli and internal affective states
- *Quick check*: Does the event-emotion mapping produce plausible emotional responses for given scenarios?

**Dialogue Strategy Selection**
- *Why needed*: Translates emotional states into concrete conversational behaviors
- *Quick check*: Are emotional states appropriately reflected in dialogue choices (e.g., assertiveness, empathy)?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Event Generator -> Self-Emotion Module -> Dialogue Strategy Selector -> LLM-based Response Generator -> Human Evaluation Pipeline

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from event generation through self-emotion processing to dialogue strategy selection, as these components must complete before the LLM can generate contextually appropriate responses. The self-emotion module serves as the pivotal transformation point that differentiates this approach from standard dialogue systems.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework trades computational efficiency for psychological realism. By requiring pre-processing of emotional states, the system adds latency compared to direct dialogue generation but gains in behavioral authenticity. The choice between GPT-4 and FLAN-T5 represents a capability-versus-resource tradeoff, with GPT-4 providing superior performance at higher computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**
Systems without self-emotion tend to produce generic, context-agnostic responses that lack personal investment. When self-emotion modules fail, agents may exhibit emotional inconsistency or inappropriate affective responses to conversational content. The most common failure mode is emotional state persistence beyond realistic timeframes, leading to contextually inappropriate dialogue.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare dialogue coherence scores between self-emotion and baseline conditions across multiple conversation turns
2. Test emotional state decay rates to determine optimal temporal boundaries for self-emotion influence
3. Evaluate cross-scenario generalization by applying self-emotion processing from one context (birthday planning) to another (museum planning)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on subjective human assessment metrics rather than objective behavioral measures
- Limited generalizability beyond collaborative planning scenarios to more complex social interactions
- Does not address potential demographic or cultural biases in self-emotion assignment and expression

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Self-emotion incorporation affects dialogue strategy selection and decision-making in controlled settings
- **Medium confidence**: Self-emotion improves naturalness and humanness based on human evaluation metrics
- **Medium confidence**: 50-66% decision change rate from limited scenario testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal studies examining self-emotion effects across multiple interaction sessions and emotional history development
2. Implement blinded evaluations where raters assess dialogue quality without knowing self-emotion conditions
3. Test framework across diverse social scenarios including conflict resolution and crisis management tasks
