# Temporal Spiking Neural Networks with Synaptic Delay for Graph Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16851
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16851
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces GRSNN for knowledge graph reasoning with synaptic delay, achieving competitive performance with 20× energy savings

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Graph Reasoning Spiking Neural Networks (GRSNN) for knowledge graph reasoning, leveraging synaptic delay and temporal coding to encode relation information and process graph paths. GRSNN serves as a neural generalization of path-based graph algorithms, enabling efficient parallel computation and superior interpretability. Empirical results demonstrate competitive performance across transductive and inductive knowledge graph completion, as well as homogeneous graph link prediction tasks, with theoretical energy savings of 20× compared to non-spiking counterparts. GRSNN achieves strong performance with fewer parameters and sparse spike computation, highlighting the potential of biologically inspired SNNs for efficient reasoning in graph-based AI applications.

## Method Summary
GRSNN extends traditional SNNs by incorporating learnable synaptic delays and temporal coding to encode relation properties and perform graph reasoning. The model uses current-based Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with discrete time steps, where synaptic connections have both weighted values and learnable delays. During inference, spike trains propagate through the network with delays accumulating along paths, and temporal decoding extracts path information from spike timing patterns. The model is trained using backpropagation through time with surrogate derivatives to handle non-differentiable spiking functions. GRSNN is designed to generalize path-based graph algorithms like Katz Index and Personalized PageRank, processing multiple paths simultaneously through parallel spike propagation.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive performance on FB15k-237 and WN18RR knowledge graph completion with fewer parameters than baselines
- Demonstrates superior energy efficiency with theoretical 20× savings compared to non-spiking counterparts
- Shows strong generalization on inductive tasks where entity information is unavailable during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synaptic delay encodes relation properties in spiking time, enabling graph reasoning.
- Mechanism: Each synaptic connection has a learnable delay parameter that represents the edge's relation property. When spike trains propagate, the time at which spikes arrive at target neurons accumulates delays along the path, effectively encoding path properties in spike timing.
- Core assumption: Delay values can be learned to represent meaningful relation properties and that these delays accumulate linearly along paths.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper reveals that SNNs, when amalgamated with synaptic delay and temporal coding, are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning"
  - [section 3.2] "We consider link prediction tasks of knowledge graphs and GRSNN is proposed as a neural generalization to the path formulation of graph algorithms"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence, but related works (paper_id: 10012, 78127) discuss delays in SNNs
- Break condition: If delay values cannot be learned to represent meaningful relation properties, or if non-linear path properties cannot be encoded through simple delay accumulation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple temporal spikes represent multiple paths simultaneously, enabling parallel path processing.
- Mechanism: Unlike traditional path-based algorithms that compute paths sequentially, GRSNN propagates spikes through the network where different spikes at different times represent different paths. The spike train from target neurons encodes information about all possible paths from source to target.
- Core assumption: The spiking neuron model can maintain distinct spike trains for different paths without interference, and decoding can extract path information from spike timing patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "Unlike SNNs for traditional graph tasks, we generalize the model to allow both positive and negative synaptic weights, acting as complementary transformations to learnable synaptic delays"
  - [section 3.2] "In GRSNN, spike trains propagate over time, with spikes at different times simultaneously maintaining all paths from the source node"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence, but related works (paper_id: 51623, 98490) discuss spike-based learning paradigms
- Break condition: If spike interference occurs preventing path distinction, or if decoding cannot reliably extract path information from temporal patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal coding with weighted spike times enables efficient path property aggregation.
- Mechanism: The decoding function assigns different weights to spikes at different times (emphasizing earlier spikes), allowing the network to compute path aggregations like Katz Index or Personalized PageRank through weighted summation of spike trains.
- Core assumption: Temporal coding can effectively replace traditional aggregation operations and that the weighted sum of spike trains can compute the desired path properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "A decoding function D calculates the pair representation hq(x, y) = D(sq_y(t)) for link prediction, and we primarily utilize temporal coding D(sq_y(t)) = Στ λτ sq_y[τ]/Στ λτ"
  - [section 3.2] "Proposition 3.1. Katz Index, Personalized PageRank, and Graph Distance can be solved by GRSNN under specific settings"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence, but related works (paper_id: 111989, 52243) discuss temporal processing in SNNs
- Break condition: If temporal coding cannot effectively replace traditional aggregation, or if the weighted sum cannot compute the required path properties.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) spiking neuron dynamics
  - Why needed here: The model uses current-based LIF neurons for spike generation and propagation
  - Quick check question: What happens to a neuron's membrane potential when it receives input spikes, and how does this lead to spike generation?

- Concept: Backpropagation through time for spiking neural networks
  - Why needed here: The model is trained using surrogate gradients to handle the non-differentiable spiking function
  - Quick check question: How does the straight-through estimator work for training quantized delay parameters in SNNs?

- Concept: Graph path formulations (Katz Index, Personalized PageRank)
  - Why needed here: GRSNN generalizes these path-based graph algorithms using spiking neural networks
  - Quick check question: How do Katz Index and Personalized PageRank differ in their path aggregation methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input neurons -> Graph nodes (spiking populations) -> Synapses (weighted connections with delays) -> Output neurons -> Temporal decoding function

- Critical path:
  1. Current injection to source neurons
  2. Spike propagation through network with delays
  3. Spike train generation at target neurons
  4. Temporal decoding to obtain pair representation
  5. Link prediction using learned function

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Delay vs. weight parameters: Delays encode temporal path properties while weights provide complementary transformations
  - Number of neurons per node: More neurons allow better path distinction but increase computational cost
  - Discrete time steps: More steps provide finer temporal resolution but increase training complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Spike rate too low: Network isn't propagating information effectively
  - Spike rate too high: Network may be saturated or have vanishing gradients
  - Poor performance on inductive tasks: Model may be overfitting to specific entities rather than learning relation properties

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify spike propagation with known delay patterns on simple graphs
  2. Test temporal decoding accuracy for different path formulations
  3. Evaluate performance degradation when removing synaptic delays

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can GRSNN achieve further energy savings by optimizing synaptic delay implementation on neuromorphic hardware?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the additional energy overhead of synaptic delay is marginal, but notes that future hardware advancements could further reduce costs.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses a Ring Buffer, which is common but may not be the most energy-efficient approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing energy consumption of different synaptic delay implementations on neuromorphic hardware, such as event-driven schemes or specialized delay circuits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does GRSNN perform on larger-scale knowledge graphs with more entities and relations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper primarily focuses on datasets with a moderate number of entities and relations, and mentions that on-chip memory limitations could be an issue for large-scale graphs.
- Why unresolved: The scalability of GRSNN to larger graphs is not explicitly tested, and the impact of increased graph size on performance and energy efficiency is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating GRSNN on benchmark datasets with significantly more entities and relations, such as Wikidata or YAGO, and comparing performance and energy consumption to other methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can GRSNN be extended to handle multi-modal knowledge graphs that include entities and relations beyond text, such as images or graphs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on text-based knowledge graphs, but mentions that graph tasks are prevalent in AI applications, suggesting potential for extension to other modalities.
- Why unresolved: The current GRSNN formulation is designed for text-based knowledge graphs, and its ability to handle other modalities is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Adapting GRSNN to incorporate multi-modal information, such as image features or graph embeddings, and evaluating its performance on multi-modal knowledge graph completion tasks.

## Limitations

- The energy efficiency claims (20× savings) are based on theoretical spiking operations rather than measured hardware implementation metrics
- Limited empirical evidence for how specific learned delay values map to relation semantics in knowledge graphs
- The model's scalability to larger graphs with thousands of entities and relations remains untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using synaptic delays for temporal encoding of graph paths is theoretically sound and well-grounded in SNN literature
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical performance results across multiple datasets are robust, but the interpretability claims need further validation
- **Low confidence**: The energy efficiency estimates and their real-world implications for hardware deployment remain speculative without experimental verification

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing synaptic delays to quantify their specific contribution to performance gains versus the baseline SNN architecture
2. Perform interpretability analysis mapping learned delay values to known relation properties in knowledge graphs to verify semantic encoding
3. Implement a prototype on neuromorphic hardware to empirically measure energy consumption and validate the theoretical efficiency estimates against actual power metrics
