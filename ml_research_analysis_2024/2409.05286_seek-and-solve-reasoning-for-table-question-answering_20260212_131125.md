# Seek and Solve Reasoning for Table Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.05286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05286
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Llama-3.1-70B achieved 79.1% accuracy on HiTab test set with SS-CoT demonstrations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses table-based question answering (TQA) with complex tables by leveraging Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities through a two-stage Seek-and-Solve pipeline. The approach uses Chain of Thought reasoning during information seeking (Seek-CoT) and consecutive reasoning from these paths in the Solve stage, outperforming task simplification alone. The authors also distill a single-step TQA-solving prompt using demonstrations with Seek-and-Solve Chain of Thought (SS-CoT) paths under In-Context Learning settings, achieving performance comparable to multi-step approaches.

## Method Summary
The Seek-and-Solve pipeline integrates two reasoning stages: a Seek stage where the LLM seeks relevant information from complex tables and generates Chain of Thought (Seek-CoT), and a Solve stage where reasoning proceeds consecutively from Seek-CoT to answer questions. The method uses tree-based semantic representations to model table header hierarchies, improving information seeking accuracy. Additionally, the authors distill a single-step TQA-solving prompt using demonstrations with SS-CoT paths under In-Context Learning settings, allowing the LLM to perform both information seeking and question answering in one step while maintaining multi-step performance.

## Key Results
- Llama-3.1-70B achieved 79.1% accuracy on HiTab test set using SS-CoT demonstrations
- Seek-CoT was shown to be more valuable than Seek-Result for guiding Solve stage reasoning
- Single-step TQA-solving prompt with SS-CoT demonstrations achieved performance on par with multi-step approaches
- The Seek-and-Solve pipeline significantly enhanced performance on complex TQA tasks compared to task simplification alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Seek-CoT (Chain of Thought generated during the Seek stage) is more valuable than Seek-Result (the simplified task) for guiding the Solve stage reasoning.
- Mechanism: The reasoning path (Seek-CoT) contains intermediate steps that are grounded in table semantics and question analysis, providing a more coherent reasoning foundation than the simplified task alone. When the Solve stage LLM reasons consecutively from Seek-CoT, it can correct errors and maintain better coherence.
- Core assumption: The reasoning path that leads to a simplified task contains information about why certain table elements are relevant, which is more useful than just knowing which elements are relevant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the reasoning process during task simplification may be more valuable than the simplified tasks themselves"
  - [section]: "Extensive experiments show that Seek-CoT can be more valuable than Seek-Result. By utilizing Seek-CoT over Seek-Result, the Seek-and-Solve pipeline significantly enhances complex TQA tasks"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for this specific mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating tree-based semantic representations improves table understanding for TQA tasks.
- Mechanism: Modeling table header hierarchies as node-based trees allows the LLM to reason about table structure more systematically. Tree paths linearized as tuples represent hierarchical semantics, enabling more accurate identification of relevant table regions during the Seek stage.
- Core assumption: Hierarchical table structures contain semantic information that flat representations cannot capture, and LLMs can leverage this structure when provided in tree format.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "modeling table header hierarchies as tree structures [1] [18] are beneficial for understanding table semantics and seeking information from complex tables"
  - [section]: "we model the table's row and column header hierarchies as a row tree and a column tree, respectively"
  - [corpus]: Weak - while tree structures are mentioned in related work, specific evidence for this paper's approach is not in the corpus

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: In-Context Learning with demonstrations containing SS-CoT paths enables single-step TQA solving that matches multi-step approaches.
- Mechanism: Demonstrations with complete Seek-and-Solve Chain of Thought (SS-CoT) paths guide the LLM to perform both information seeking and question answering in a single step. The SS-CoT provides structured reasoning that grounds each step in relevant table contents.
- Core assumption: LLMs can learn to replicate complex reasoning patterns from demonstrations, and grounding each reasoning step in table contents improves accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we distill a single-step TQA-solving prompt from this pipeline, using demonstrations with SS-CoT paths to guide the LLM in solving complex TQA tasks under In-Context Learning settings"
  - [section]: "Experimental results show that using samples with SS-CoT paths as demonstrations, this single-step TQA-solving prompt can guide the LLM to achieve performance on par with multistep approaches"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific ICL approach with SS-CoT demonstrations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: Enables the LLM to break down complex TQA reasoning into intermediate steps, improving accuracy and faithfulness to the table data
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between vanilla-CoT and Seek-CoT in this paper's approach?

- Concept: In-Context Learning (ICL)
  - Why needed here: Allows the model to learn from demonstrations without fine-tuning, enabling the single-step TQA-solving prompt to achieve multi-step performance
  - Quick check question: How does the paper use ICL differently in the Seek stage versus the TQA-solving prompt?

- Concept: Tree-based table representation
  - Why needed here: Captures hierarchical table semantics that flat representations miss, enabling better information seeking from complex tables
  - Quick check question: What information does each node in the table tree structure store according to the paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw table → Tree structure conversion → Seek stage (information seeking) → Solve stage (reasoning from Seek-CoT) → Answer
- Critical path: Raw table → Tree structure conversion → Seek stage (information seeking) → Solve stage (reasoning from Seek-CoT) → Answer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Including full table in prompts vs. simplified versions (tradeoff between completeness and focus)
  - Using separate LLM calls vs. single integrated prompt (tradeoff between modularity and efficiency)
  - Tree path selection granularity (tradeoff between specificity and coverage)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on tables with complex hierarchical structures
  - Inability to correct errors from Seek stage when using task simplification
  - Degraded performance when demonstrations in ICL don't match target task distribution
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance with and without Seek-CoT in the Solve stage to validate the core mechanism
  2. Test error tolerance by using different LLM capabilities in Seek vs. Solve stages
  3. Evaluate single-step prompt performance against the full Seek-and-Solve pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Seek-and-Solve pipeline vary with different tree structures for modeling table semantics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a node-based tree structure to model table header hierarchies and suggests that this structure is beneficial for understanding table semantics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore alternative tree structures or compare their effectiveness in the Seek-and-Solve pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different tree structures (e.g., different node definitions, alternative linearization methods) and comparing their performance in the Seek-and-Solve pipeline would provide insights into the optimal tree structure for TQA tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Seek-and-Solve pipeline be effectively applied to other types of structured data beyond tables, such as graphs or knowledge bases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on table-based question answering and introduces a tree structure to model table semantics, suggesting a structured approach to information seeking and reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the application of the Seek-and-Solve pipeline to other structured data formats.
- What evidence would resolve it: Adapting the Seek-and-Solve pipeline to handle graphs or knowledge bases and evaluating its performance on question answering tasks involving these data structures would determine its generalizability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different prompt engineering techniques on the performance of the TQA-solving prompt with SS-CoT demonstrations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses prompt engineering techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) to guide the LLM's reasoning process.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of various prompt engineering techniques on the performance of the TQA-solving prompt.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different prompt engineering techniques (e.g., different CoT formats, ICL settings) and comparing their performance with the SS-CoT demonstrations would provide insights into the optimal prompt engineering approach for TQA tasks.

## Limitations

- The Seek-and-Solve pipeline relies heavily on the quality of the Seek-CoT generation, which may not always be accurate or efficient
- The paper lacks direct comparisons with state-of-the-art table-specific models that use specialized architectures rather than general LLMs
- The computational cost of the two-stage pipeline versus the single-step approach is not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using reasoning paths (Seek-CoT) over simplified results for guiding Solve stage reasoning, supported by experimental results showing improved performance and error tolerance.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of tree-based semantic representations for table understanding, as the paper shows benefits but lacks direct ablation studies isolating this component's contribution.
- **Medium Confidence**: The single-step prompt distillation achieving comparable performance to multi-step approaches, though the evaluation primarily focuses on one LLM model (Llama-3.1-70B).

## Next Checks

1. **Error Analysis and Robustness Testing**: Conduct detailed error analysis on the HiTab and WikiTableQuestions datasets to identify failure modes, particularly focusing on tables with deeply nested hierarchies or ambiguous question formulations. Test the system's robustness by intentionally introducing errors in the Seek stage and measuring the Solve stage's ability to recover.

2. **Ablation Studies on Tree Representation**: Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of tree-based semantic representations by comparing performance with and without tree structures, using different tree linearization methods, and testing on tables with varying levels of hierarchical complexity.

3. **Generalization Across LLM Models**: Validate the single-step prompt distillation approach across multiple LLM architectures and sizes beyond Llama-3.1-70B, including both larger and smaller models, to assess whether the SS-CoT demonstration approach generalizes or is model-specific.
