# gaHealth: An English-Irish Bilingual Corpus of Health Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03575
- Reference count: 0
- First bilingual health corpus for Irish language developed

## Executive Summary
This study presents gaHealth, a bilingual corpus of health data for the low-resource English-Irish language pair. The corpus was developed by extracting and cleaning parallel documents from government sources, creating a specialized toolchain to handle noisy PDF inputs and align sentence-level data. Neural machine translation models were trained using this in-domain corpus, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models for health-related translation between English and Irish.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a comprehensive corpus creation pipeline starting with PDF extraction from government health documents. They implemented a specialized toolchain to clean noisy PDF outputs and align parallel sentences between English and Irish versions. The corpus was then used to train neural machine translation models specifically for the health domain. The methodology emphasizes handling the challenges of low-resource language pairs and noisy document formats common in government publications.

## Key Results
- BLEU score improvement of up to 22.2 points (40%) over top models from LoResMT2021 Shared Task
- First bilingual health corpus specifically created for the Irish language
- Successfully demonstrated application of domain-specific corpus for improved translation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improvement in translation quality stems from domain-specific training data that captures the specialized vocabulary and phrasing patterns common in health-related documents. By focusing on government health sources, the corpus ensures consistency in terminology and style, which is particularly important for low-resource languages where training data is scarce. The specialized toolchain addresses the common challenge of processing noisy PDF documents to extract clean parallel text.

## Foundational Learning
- **Corpus alignment methodology**: Why needed - to create parallel sentence pairs from unaligned documents; Quick check - verify alignment accuracy through spot-checking
- **PDF text extraction techniques**: Why needed - government documents are often in PDF format; Quick check - compare extracted text against original PDF quality
- **Domain adaptation for low-resource languages**: Why needed - general corpora don't capture domain-specific terminology; Quick check - evaluate domain-specific vs. general model performance
- **BLEU score interpretation**: Why needed - automated metrics for translation quality; Quick check - verify calculation methodology matches baseline
- **Neural machine translation training**: Why needed - modern approach for translation quality; Quick check - confirm model architecture and training parameters

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: PDF Extraction -> Text Cleaning -> Sentence Alignment -> Neural MT Training -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The pipeline follows a sequential flow where quality at each stage directly impacts downstream components. PDF extraction quality affects cleaning accuracy, which influences alignment precision, ultimately determining translation model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach prioritizes domain specificity over corpus size, accepting limited data volume in exchange for highly relevant health domain content. This tradeoff is justified for low-resource languages where quality often trumps quantity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor alignment quality manifests as translation errors in terminology consistency. Cleaning failures appear as garbled text or missing content in final translations. Model performance issues indicate problems with either corpus quality or training methodology.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test PDF extraction accuracy on sample documents to verify cleaning toolchain effectiveness
2. Evaluate sentence alignment precision using human validation on sample pairs
3. Compare baseline BLEU scores using different evaluation methodologies to clarify improvement claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The BLEU score improvement claims (22.2 points, 40%) may have reporting inconsistencies and lack transparency in baseline comparison methodology
- Corpus development relies entirely on government sources, potentially introducing domain bias and limiting broader applicability
- Specialized toolchain robustness and generalizability to other low-resource language pairs remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical approach for corpus development and toolchain creation is methodologically sound; claim of first Irish health corpus is verifiable
- **Medium confidence**: BLEU score improvements require additional verification due to potential reporting ambiguities and lack of baseline methodology details
- **Low confidence**: Claims about toolchain robustness and corpus applicability beyond government domains lack empirical support

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the BLEU score calculation using publicly available corpus and detailed baseline model specifications to verify the claimed 22.2-point improvement
2. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing translations from gaHealth corpus against baseline models to assess alignment between automated metrics and human judgments
3. Perform comprehensive corpus quality analysis including parallel sentence alignment accuracy, domain representativeness across health subdomains, and systematic assessment of noise levels in PDF extraction
