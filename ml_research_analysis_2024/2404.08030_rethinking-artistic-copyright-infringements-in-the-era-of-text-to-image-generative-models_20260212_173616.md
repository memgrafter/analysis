# Rethinking Artistic Copyright Infringements in the Era of Text-to-Image Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08030
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08030
- Reference count: 40
- Only 20.2% of artists in WikiArt dataset are at risk of style copying by popular text-to-image generative models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the growing concern about text-to-image generative models copying artistic styles, potentially infringing on artists' copyrights. The authors introduce ArtSavant, a practical tool that detects style copying by reformulating the problem as classification over sets of images rather than individual images. ArtSavant combines two complementary methods: DeepMatch, a neural network classifier achieving 89.3% accuracy, and TagMatch, an interpretable tag-based classifier with 61.6% top-1 accuracy. Empirical analysis reveals that only a minority of artists (20.2%) are at risk of having their styles copied by popular generative models like Stable Diffusion and OpenJourney.

## Method Summary
The authors develop ArtSavant, a detection tool that reformulates artistic copyright infringement as a classification problem over image sets. The tool combines DeepMatch, which uses a neural network classifier on image embeddings with majority voting, and TagMatch, which employs a novel zero-shot selective multilabel tagging method using CLIP to create interpretable tag signatures. The methods are validated on a WikiArt dataset of 372 artists before being applied to generated images to assess style copying risks.

## Key Results
- DeepMatch achieves 89.3% accuracy in recognizing artistic styles across 372 artists
- TagMatch provides interpretable insights with 61.6% top-1 and 82.5% top-5 accuracy
- Only 20.2% of artists in the dataset are at risk of having their styles copied by popular generative models
- The classification-over-image-sets approach successfully detects artistic style copying where image-wise methods might fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The classification problem over image sets can detect artistic style copying by comparing a test portfolio to reference artist portfolios.
- Mechanism: Reformulates artistic copyright infringement as a classification task over sets of images rather than individual images, using DeepMatch and TagMatch to compare portfolios.
- Core assumption: Unique artistic styles exist for a large fraction of artists and can be distinguished by comparing sets of their works.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we first reformulate the problem of 'artistic copyright infringement' to a classification problem over image sets, instead of probing image-wise similarities."
  - [section] "we first reformulate the copyright infringement of artistic styles through the lens of classification over image sets, rather than a single image."
- Break condition: If unique artistic styles do not exist for a large fraction of artists, or if styles are too similar to distinguish between artists.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DeepMatch can recognize artistic styles by mapping each artist to a neural signature via a classifier.
- Mechanism: Uses a neural network classifier on images and majority voting aggregation to obtain one prediction for a set of images, implicitly mapping each artist to a neural signature during training.
- Core assumption: Neural classifiers can capture unique and frequently co-occurring characteristics of artists in their embedding space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DeepMatch achieves 89.3% accuracy in recognizing artistic styles across a dataset of 372 artists from WikiArt."
  - [section] "DeepMatch implicitly maps each artist to a vector (via the classification head) during training, which can be interpreted as a neural signature representing an artist."
- Break condition: If the neural signature does not capture unique characteristics or if majority voting fails to aggregate predictions effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TagMatch can detect and articulate artistic styles using interpretable tag signatures.
- Mechanism: Tags individual artworks using zero-shot selective multilabel classification with CLIP, composes tags to find unique tag signatures per artist, and matches these signatures to detect artistic styles.
- Core assumption: Tag compositions become less frequent as the number of atomic tags increases, making them unique to specific artists.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TagMatch provides explainable insights with 61.6% top-1 and 82.5% top-5 accuracy."
  - [section] "TagMatch first tags individual artworks using a tagging method via a novel zero-shot, selective, multilabel classification using CLIP."
- Break condition: If tag compositions do not become unique enough to distinguish artists or if tagging method fails to capture relevant stylistic elements.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Classification over image sets
  - Why needed here: To detect artistic style copying by comparing sets of images rather than individual images, capturing the holistic nature of artistic style.
  - Quick check question: Why is classification over image sets more effective than image-wise comparisons for detecting artistic style copying?

- Concept: Neural signatures
  - Why needed here: To represent unique artistic styles in a way that neural classifiers can distinguish between different artists.
  - Quick check question: How do neural signatures capture the unique characteristics of an artist's style?

- Concept: Tag signatures
  - Why needed here: To provide interpretable and attributable explanations for style detection, making the tool useful for non-technical stakeholders.
  - Quick check question: How do tag signatures enable analytic arguments for artistic style copying?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  WikiArt dataset (372 artists, 90,960 artworks) -> DeepMatch classifier (MLP on CLIP embeddings) + TagMatch (CLIP-based tagging) -> ArtSavant detection tool -> Generated image analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Curate WikiArt dataset with at least 100 works per artist
  2. Train DeepMatch classifier on image embeddings
  3. Implement TagMatch tagging and tag composition
  4. Validate methods on held-out real art
  5. Apply methods to generated images to detect style copying

- Design tradeoffs:
  - DeepMatch offers higher accuracy but lacks interpretability
  - TagMatch provides interpretability but lower accuracy
  - Combining both methods balances accuracy and interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Low match rates in generated images may indicate styles are not copied
  - High match rates with low confidence may indicate superficial style similarities
  - Inability to recognize certain artists' styles may indicate overly similar styles

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train DeepMatch classifier and validate on held-out real art
  2. Implement TagMatch tagging and validation on held-out real art
  3. Apply both methods to generated images and analyze results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of TagMatch vary when applied to artists with very similar styles versus those with distinct styles?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that some artists, like Palma Il Giovane, have styles that are very similar to other artists in the dataset, which can make it challenging to recognize their unique styles using DeepMatch.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of TagMatch's performance across artists with varying degrees of stylistic similarity, nor does it discuss how this might affect the interpretability and attribution capabilities of the tool.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic analysis of TagMatch's accuracy and interpretability when applied to artists with highly similar styles versus those with distinct styles would provide insights into the tool's robustness and limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential improvements in tag-based classification if a more advanced image tagging model than CLIP is used?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that CLIP, while effective, is known to have issues with complex concepts and may not achieve perfect recall in tagging.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of using more advanced or specialized image tagging models on the performance and interpretability of TagMatch.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different image tagging models and comparing their impact on the accuracy and interpretability of TagMatch would help identify potential improvements and limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the prevalence of artistic style copying change when using more advanced text-to-image generative models than those studied in the paper?
- Basis in paper: The paper analyzes the style copying capabilities of three specific text-to-image generative models (Stable Diffusion v1.4, v2.0, and OpenJourney) and finds that only 20% of artists are at high risk of style copying.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate whether newer or more advanced generative models might exhibit different or increased tendencies for style copying.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a similar analysis using the latest text-to-image generative models and comparing the results with those from the paper would provide insights into how the prevalence of style copying evolves with technological advancements.

## Limitations

- The study relies on publicly available artworks from WikiArt, which may not be representative of all artistic styles or capture the full diversity of artistic expression.
- The detection methods may not generalize well to artists outside the WikiArt dataset or to contemporary digital art forms.
- The empirical finding that only 20.2% of artists are at risk of style copying is based on specific generative models and may not apply to other models or future developments.
- The interpretability provided by TagMatch comes at the cost of lower accuracy compared to DeepMatch, potentially limiting its practical utility in real-world copyright disputes.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The methodology for detecting artistic style copying through classification over image sets is technically sound and well-supported by the empirical results.
- Medium confidence: The empirical finding that only 20.2% of artists are at risk of style copying is plausible but may not generalize to other datasets or generative models.
- Medium confidence: The interpretability provided by TagMatch is valuable for practical applications, but the lower accuracy compared to DeepMatch limits its standalone utility.

## Next Checks

1. Validate the detection methods on a more diverse dataset that includes contemporary digital artists and non-Western artistic traditions to assess generalizability beyond WikiArt.

2. Test the methods on additional text-to-image generative models beyond Stable Diffusion and OpenJourney to determine if the 20.2% risk estimate holds across different model architectures.

3. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether the interpretability provided by TagMatch aligns with expert judgments of artistic style similarity and potential copyright infringement.
