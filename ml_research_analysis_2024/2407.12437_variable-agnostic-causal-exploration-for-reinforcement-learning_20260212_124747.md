core_contribution: VACERL introduces a framework for RL agents to discover causal
  relationships without assuming predefined environmental variables. It automatically
  identifies crucial observation-action steps using attention mechanisms, constructs
  a causal graph, and uses this to improve exploration via intrinsic rewards or hierarchical
  subgoals.
