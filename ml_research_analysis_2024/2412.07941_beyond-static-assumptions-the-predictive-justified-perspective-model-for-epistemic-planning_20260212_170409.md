# Beyond Static Assumptions: the Predictive Justified Perspective Model for Epistemic Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.07941
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07941
- Reference count: 7
- Extends JP model with predictive retrieval functions for dynamic variables

## Executive Summary
The paper extends the Justified Perspective model for Epistemic Planning to handle dynamic environments with changing variables. The proposed Predictive Justified Perspective model uses past observations to predict changes in processual variables, enabling agents to reason about nested beliefs over changing variables. The model introduces a predictive retrieval function that estimates variable values based on their changing patterns, while maintaining consistency with observations. Implemented in the Grapevine domain, the PJP model demonstrates flexibility in handling various variable types including first-order polynomials, power functions, and sinusoidal functions.

## Method Summary
The PJP model extends the JP model by incorporating processual variables that change due to environmental effects rather than agent actions. Instead of assuming beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation, the model uses past observations to predict changes through predictive retrieval functions. These functions estimate variable values based on their changing patterns while maintaining three consistency properties: preserving consistency (predicted values consistent with observations), recursive consistency (stable when additional predicted values are included), and reconstructive consistency (do not conflict with agents' observations). The model was implemented using Breadth-First Search in the Grapevine domain with PDDL+ encoding.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates successful prediction of variable values using different function types (polynomial, power, sinusoidal)
- Shows computational cost increases with problem complexity but maintains validity of generated plans
- Extends epistemic planning applicability to real-world dynamic environments like robotics and autonomous systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The PJP model extends the JP model by introducing processual variables and predictive retrieval functions, enabling agents to reason about nested beliefs over changing variables.
- Mechanism: Instead of assuming beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation, the PJP model uses past observations to predict changes in processual variables through a predictive retrieval function that estimates variable values based on their changing patterns.
- Core assumption: Processual variables can be modeled with known types (e.g., first-order polynomials, power functions, sinusoidal functions) and their changing patterns can be inferred from past observations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed Predictive Justified Perspective model uses past observations to predict changes in processual variables, enabling agents to reason about nested beliefs over changing variables."
  - [section]: "Rather than following the JP model's assumption that beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation, the PJP model uses past observations to predict changes in variables."
- Break condition: If the processual variable type is unknown or too complex to model with the available predictive retrieval functions, the PJP model cannot accurately predict variable values.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The PJP model maintains consistency between predictions and observations through preserving consistency, recursive consistency, and reconstructive consistency properties of the predictive retrieval function.
- Mechanism: The predictive retrieval function ensures that predicted values are consistent with observed values (preserving consistency), stable when additional predicted values are included (recursive consistency), and do not conflict with agents' observations (reconstructive consistency).
- Core assumption: The predictive retrieval function can be designed to satisfy all three consistency properties for the given processual variable types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The prediction function pr_type(v) estimates the value of variable v at time t by deriving v's changing pattern based on the given state sequence ⃗s. A valid predictive retrieval function must be preserving consistent and recursively consistent."
- Break condition: If the predictive retrieval function cannot satisfy the consistency properties for a particular processual variable type, the PJP model may generate inconsistent beliefs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The PJP model extends the applicability of epistemic planning to dynamic environments by supporting reasoning about nested beliefs over changing variables, demonstrated through experiments in the Grapevine domain.
- Mechanism: By incorporating processual variables and predictive retrieval functions, the PJP model can handle scenarios where variables change due to environmental effects rather than agent actions, such as moving objects or falling balls.
- Core assumption: The Grapevine domain with processual variables is representative of real-world dynamic environments where epistemic planning can be applied.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Implemented in the Grapevine domain, the PJP model demonstrates flexibility in handling various variable types including first-order polynomials, power functions, and sinusoidal functions."
- Break condition: If the dynamic environment involves processual variables that cannot be modeled with the available predictive retrieval functions, the PJP model may not be applicable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Processual variables and their changing patterns
  - Why needed here: The PJP model introduces processual variables to model variables that change due to environmental effects rather than agent actions. Understanding how these variables change over time is crucial for implementing the predictive retrieval functions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a static variable and a processual variable in the context of epistemic planning?

- Concept: Predictive retrieval functions and their consistency properties
  - Why needed here: The predictive retrieval functions are the core mechanism that enables the PJP model to predict variable values based on past observations. Understanding the consistency properties (preserving, recursive, and reconstructive) is essential for implementing valid predictive retrieval functions.
  - Quick check question: What are the three consistency properties that a valid predictive retrieval function must satisfy in the PJP model?

- Concept: Epistemic planning and nested beliefs
  - Why needed here: The PJP model is an extension of epistemic planning that focuses on reasoning about agents' knowledge and beliefs, including nested beliefs (beliefs about other agents' beliefs). Understanding the basics of epistemic planning is necessary to appreciate the contributions of the PJP model.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between knowledge and belief in epistemic planning, and how does the PJP model handle nested beliefs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Processual Variable Model (Ω) -> Predictive Retrieval Functions (PR) -> PJP Function (f_i) -> Ternary Semantics (T)

- Critical path:
  1. Define the processual variable model (Ω) for the domain
  2. Implement predictive retrieval functions (PR) for each processual variable type
  3. Integrate the PJP function (f_i) with the predictive retrieval functions
  4. Use the ternary semantics (T) to evaluate epistemic formulas in planning problems

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. complexity: The PJP model offers flexibility in handling various processual variable types but requires more complex implementation of predictive retrieval functions
  - Accuracy vs. computational cost: More accurate predictive retrieval functions may increase computational cost, especially for complex processual variable types
  - Domain-specific vs. domain-independent: Some predictive retrieval functions (e.g., for static variables) can be domain-independent, while others require domain-specific knowledge

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent beliefs: If the predictive retrieval functions do not satisfy the consistency properties, agents may generate inconsistent beliefs
  - Poor predictions: If the processual variable types are too complex or unknown, the predictive retrieval functions may generate poor predictions
  - Computational inefficiency: If the predictive retrieval functions are too complex or the number of processual variables is too large, the PJP model may become computationally inefficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple domain with one processual variable (e.g., a moving object) and test the PJP model's ability to predict its position over time
  2. Compare the PJP model's predictions with ground truth in a domain with known processual variable types (e.g., first-order polynomials)
  3. Test the PJP model's ability to handle nested beliefs in a multi-agent domain with changing variables (e.g., the Grapevine domain)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can learning-based methods like neural networks be integrated into the PJP model's predictive retrieval functions to eliminate the need for predefined processual variable models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "Beyond these examples, the model's flexibility is further demonstrated by its support for incorporating alternative prediction functions (Definition 10). This allows for the integration of learning-based methods such as linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks."
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this as a potential direction but does not provide concrete implementation details or evaluate such approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of the PJP model successfully incorporating neural network-based predictive retrieval functions, showing improved performance over predefined models in dynamic environments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs between different predictive retrieval functions in terms of planning efficiency and accuracy in complex epistemic planning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "An interesting point that can be noticed is that the choice of the predictive retrieval function may influence the efficiency of the planner. For example, the prlinear reg used in G2 is less efficient (from τp) compared to the analytical method in G1."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only compare a limited set of predictive retrieval functions, and a systematic analysis of their computational costs and accuracy across various problem types is lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments comparing multiple predictive retrieval functions (analytical, regression-based, machine learning-based) across diverse epistemic planning benchmarks, measuring both computational time and solution quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the PJP model handle scenarios where agents have conflicting beliefs about the coefficients of processual variables, particularly in adversarial settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates agents having different beliefs about variable values in Example 1, but does not address how to handle conflicts when agents disagree on the underlying parameters governing variable changes.
- Why unresolved: The current PJP model assumes a single processual variable model, but in multi-agent settings with conflicting information, agents might maintain different models or coefficient estimates.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal extension of the PJP model that incorporates agent-specific processual variable models, along with experimental validation showing how the planner handles conflicting coefficient beliefs in adversarial planning scenarios.

## Limitations

- The model relies heavily on accurate modeling of processual variable types, failing when variables exhibit complex or unknown patterns
- Computational overhead increases significantly with nested belief levels and large numbers of processual variables
- Current implementation focuses on single-agent perspectives without demonstrated multi-agent nested belief handling

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core mechanism of extending JP models with predictive retrieval functions for processual variables is well-specified and theoretically grounded.
- Medium confidence: The consistency properties (preserving, recursive, reconstructive) are formally defined but require empirical validation across diverse variable types.
- Medium confidence: The Grapevine domain experiments demonstrate proof-of-concept functionality, but the small problem instances may not capture scalability challenges in real-world applications.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-variable type validation**: Test the predictive retrieval functions on synthetic data with known ground truth for polynomial, power, and sinusoidal functions to measure prediction accuracy across all variable types.
2. **Scalability stress test**: Implement the PJP model on larger problem instances with increased numbers of processual variables and nested belief levels to identify computational bottlenecks and assess real-world applicability.
3. **Multi-agent nested belief evaluation**: Extend the current single-agent experiments to multi-agent scenarios where agents must reason about each other's beliefs about changing variables, measuring both correctness and computational overhead.
