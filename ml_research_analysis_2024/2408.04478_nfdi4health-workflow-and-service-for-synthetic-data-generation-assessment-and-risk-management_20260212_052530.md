# NFDI4Health workflow and service for synthetic data generation, assessment and risk management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04478
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04478
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Introduces NFDI4Health toolkit for generating and evaluating synthetic clinical data with privacy preservation

## Executive Summary
NFDI4Health addresses the challenge of generating synthetic health data from multimodal longitudinal clinical studies with missing values. The toolkit combines two AI-based generative models, VAMBN and MultiNODEs, with a web-based evaluation tool called SYNDAT. VAMBN uses a hybrid autoencoder-Bayesian Network approach to preserve complex clinical correlations, while MultiNODEs generates realistic continuous-time trajectories using Neural ODEs. SYNDAT provides comprehensive assessment of both data quality and privacy risks through multiple metrics.

## Method Summary
The NFDI4Health toolkit employs VAMBN, which uses heterogeneous incomplete variational autoencoders per module connected by a Bayesian Network to model dependencies in multimodal clinical data. MultiNODEs generates continuous-time patient trajectories by encoding data into latent space, solving Neural ODEs, and decoding back to original space. SYNDAT evaluates synthetic data quality using discrimination complexity, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and correlation preservation metrics, while also assessing privacy risks through a framework based on Giomi et al.'s work.

## Key Results
- Synthetic data generated by VAMBN closely mimics real clinical data with high scores in quality metrics
- SYNDAT successfully identifies quality and privacy risks in synthetic data through multi-metric evaluation
- The toolkit enables data sharing and collaboration in clinical research while preserving patient privacy
- VAMBN shows better interpretability through its Bayesian Network structure compared to monolithic generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VAMBN's hybrid modeling (autoencoder + Bayesian Network) preserves complex clinical correlations better than monolithic generative models.
- Mechanism: VAMBN first encodes heterogeneous, incomplete data into a low-dimensional latent space per module, then models inter-module dependencies via a Bayesian Network. This separates local structure (handled by autoencoders) from global dependency structure (handled by Bayesian Network), enabling realistic synthetic data generation for multimodal longitudinal clinical studies.
- Core assumption: The latent representation learned by the autoencoder per module captures all relevant statistical structure for that module.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] VAMBN is described as a hybrid approach that "initially the potentially high dimensional feature space of a clinical study is grouped into modules" and "connected via a Bayesian Network."
  - [section] VAMBN uses "Heterogeneous Incomplete Variational Autoencoder" for each module and then connects them via a Bayesian Network to model visit sequences and missingness.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for VAMBN's specific mechanism; assumption is based on cited papers.
- Break condition: If modules are not truly independent or the Bayesian Network cannot accurately capture inter-module dependencies, the synthetic data will lose correlation structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MultiNODEs generates realistic continuous-time trajectories by solving Neural ODEs in latent space.
- Mechanism: MultiNODEs encodes static and longitudinal data jointly into a latent space, uses this as initial conditions for a Neural ODE, solves the ODE to obtain a latent disease trajectory, and decodes this back to the original data space. This allows interpolation and extrapolation of patient trajectories on continuous time scales.
- Core assumption: The Neural ODE accurately represents the underlying temporal dynamics of the clinical data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] MultiNODEs "model the longitudinal part of the data on a continuous time scale using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE)."
  - [section] MultiNODEs "are trained via variational inference it is possible to generate highly realistic synthetic patient trajectories on continuous time scale."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for MultiNODEs' specific mechanism; assumption is based on cited papers.
- Break condition: If the Neural ODE cannot capture the true temporal dynamics, generated trajectories will be unrealistic, especially during extrapolation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SYNDAT's multi-metric evaluation captures both data quality and privacy risk in synthetic clinical data.
- Mechanism: SYNDAT uses three quality metrics (ML classifier discrimination, Jensen-Shannon Divergence for distribution similarity, and Frobenius norm of correlation matrices for correlation preservation) to assess data fidelity, and privacy risk scores based on Giomi et al.'s framework to assess re-identification risks. This multi-faceted approach provides a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data utility and privacy.
- Core assumption: The three quality metrics together provide a sufficient assessment of synthetic data fidelity to real clinical data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] SYNDAT "uses metrics like discrimination complexity, distribution similarity, and correlation preservation to evaluate synthetic data."
  - [section] SYNDAT compares real and synthetic data using "ability to discriminate between real and synthetic data by a machine learning (ML) classifier," "similarity of marginal statistical distributions...measured via their Jensen-Shannon-Divergence (JSD)," and "a score measuring the preservation of the correlation structure."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for SYNDAT's specific metrics; assumption is based on cited papers.
- Break condition: If any of the metrics fail to capture critical aspects of data quality or privacy, the evaluation will be incomplete or misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Why needed here: VAMBN and MultiNODEs both use VAEs as part of their generative modeling approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a VAE and a standard autoencoder, and why is this difference important for generative modeling?

- Concept: Bayesian Networks
  - Why needed here: VAMBN uses a Bayesian Network to model dependencies between modules after initial encoding.
  - Quick check question: How does a Bayesian Network represent probabilistic dependencies, and why is this useful for modeling clinical data with complex inter-variable relationships?

- Concept: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)
  - Why needed here: MultiNODEs uses Neural ODEs to model continuous-time trajectories in latent space.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using a Neural ODE over a discrete-time RNN for modeling continuous-time processes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VAMBN: Heterogeneous Incomplete VAE (per module) → Bayesian Network → Synthetic Data. MultiNODEs: Joint Encoder → Neural ODE Solver → Decoder → Synthetic Data. SYNDAT: Data Upload → Quality/Privacy Metric Computation → Visualization/Outlier Detection.
- Critical path: For VAMBN: Data preprocessing → Module encoding → Bayesian Network modeling → Data synthesis. For MultiNODEs: Data preprocessing → Joint encoding → Neural ODE solving → Data synthesis. For SYNDAT: Data upload → Metric computation → Visualization.
- Design tradeoffs: VAMBN vs MultiNODEs: VAMBN is computationally lighter and provides interpretable Bayesian Network graph, but MultiNODEs better preserves correlation structure and enables continuous-time trajectory generation. SYNDAT vs other evaluation tools: SYNDAT provides both quality and privacy assessment in one tool, but may not cover all possible evaluation metrics.
- Failure signatures: VAMBN: Synthetic data with unrealistic correlations between modules. MultiNODEs: Generated trajectories that diverge from realistic patient patterns. SYNDAT: Quality metrics that don't align with domain expert assessment.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run VAMBN on a small synthetic dataset and visualize the Bayesian Network to check if it captures known dependencies.
  2. Generate synthetic trajectories with MultiNODEs and compare them to real trajectories using t-SNE embedding.
  3. Use SYNDAT to evaluate synthetic data from a simple generative model and check if the metrics align with visual inspection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between privacy guarantees (e.g., differential privacy) and data utility in synthetic clinical data generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future research should also focus on the further development of implementations that provide privacy guarantees for generative methods while limiting potential loss of data utility."
- Why unresolved: Differential privacy implementation in generative models typically reduces data utility, and the trade-off is not well-defined for clinical data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing synthetic data quality and privacy risk scores across different DP implementations and parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective are synthetic data generation methods like VAMBN and MultiNODEs for federated learning across multiple clinical data centers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future developments could include the use of synthetic data to facilitate federated learning (FL), where data scientists need to develop algorithms without having direct access to data."
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses potential applications but does not provide empirical validation of synthetic data use in federated learning settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating model performance and data utility when training on synthetic data distributed across federated nodes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the best practices for systematically comparing generative models for synthetic clinical data beyond the metrics provided in SYNDAT?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Another aspect which we aimed at addressing by introducing SYNDAT was the lack of consensus for the systematic and objective methods for comparing generative models, focusing primarily on synthetic health data cohorts."
- Why unresolved: While SYNDAT provides evaluation tools, the paper acknowledges that there is no universal consensus on comprehensive model comparison methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of standardized benchmark datasets and comparison frameworks for clinical synthetic data generation.

## Limitations
- Validation is based on only two datasets (ADNI and RKI glioblastoma data), which may not represent full diversity of clinical data scenarios
- Privacy risk assessment relies on Giomi et al. framework, but effectiveness for complex multimodal clinical data requires further validation
- Computational complexity of VAMBN for large-scale studies is not fully characterized
- Relationship between quality metrics and actual downstream analytical utility needs more investigation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The hybrid modeling approach (autoencoder + Bayesian Network) for VAMBN is theoretically sound and addresses a well-defined problem in clinical data synthesis
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of MultiNODEs for continuous-time trajectory generation, based on limited empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence**: SYNDAT's multi-metric evaluation framework, pending broader validation across diverse clinical datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test VAMBN and MultiNODEs on additional clinical datasets with different modalities and missingness patterns to assess generalizability
2. Conduct user studies with clinical researchers to validate that synthetic data generated by NFDI4Health toolkit supports meaningful downstream analyses
3. Perform systematic privacy risk assessment using membership inference attacks to validate the effectiveness of privacy preservation mechanisms
