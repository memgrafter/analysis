# VideoEspresso: A Large-Scale Chain-of-Thought Dataset for Fine-Grained Video Reasoning via Core Frame Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14794
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14794
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces VideoEspresso dataset with 37.2K videos and 100K+ QA pairs for fine-grained video reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VideoEspresso, a large-scale video question-answering dataset designed to enhance fine-grained video reasoning through semantic-aware core frame selection and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. The dataset construction pipeline employs semantic filtering to reduce redundancy, generates QA pairs using GPT-4o, and enriches reasoning with CoT evidence grounded in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To leverage this high-quality data, the authors propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework that combines a lightweight Frame Selector with a two-stage instruction-tuned reasoning LVLM. Evaluated across 14 tasks on 9 popular LVLMs, their method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines on most tasks with an average accuracy of 34.1%, and demonstrates significant gains in efficiency and reasoning depth. The code and dataset will be publicly released.

## Method Summary
The VideoEspresso dataset is constructed through a pipeline that includes semantic filtering to remove redundant frames, QA pair generation using GPT-4o, and enrichment with Chain-of-Thought annotations grounded in spatial and temporal dimensions. The Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework consists of a lightweight Frame Selector that identifies semantically relevant frames, followed by a two-stage instruction-tuned reasoning LVLM that performs fine-grained video reasoning. The approach is evaluated across 14 tasks on 9 popular LVLMs, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 34.1%.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 14 tasks on 9 popular LVLMs
- Average accuracy of 34.1% on benchmark tasks
- Outperformed baselines on most tasks while demonstrating improved efficiency and reasoning depth

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining semantic-aware core frame selection with multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning. The semantic filtering process reduces redundancy in video frames, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant information. The CoT annotations provide step-by-step reasoning evidence that is grounded in both spatial and temporal dimensions, enabling more accurate and interpretable answers. The Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework leverages a lightweight Frame Selector to identify key frames, followed by a reasoning LVLM that performs fine-grained analysis, creating a division of labor that optimizes both efficiency and accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic Filtering**: Why needed - To reduce redundancy and focus on relevant information; Quick check - Verify that filtered frames retain essential semantic content
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Why needed - To provide interpretable, step-by-step reasoning for complex video questions; Quick check - Ensure CoT steps logically connect to final answers
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Why needed - To integrate visual and temporal information for comprehensive video understanding; Quick check - Validate that both spatial and temporal cues are effectively utilized
- **Instruction Tuning**: Why needed - To adapt large models to specific video reasoning tasks; Quick check - Confirm improved performance on task-specific benchmarks
- **Frame Selection**: Why needed - To identify semantically relevant frames for efficient processing; Quick check - Measure the impact of selected frames on final accuracy
- **Hybrid Collaboration**: Why needed - To combine lightweight selection with heavy reasoning for optimal efficiency; Quick check - Compare against end-to-end approaches

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw Video -> Semantic Filter -> Frame Selector -> Reasoning LVLM -> QA Output
**Critical Path**: The semantic filtering and frame selection stages are critical for reducing input complexity and focusing the reasoning LVLM on relevant content.
**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades some potential information loss from filtering for significant gains in efficiency and reasoning quality. The use of GPT-4o for annotation introduces potential biases but enables scalable dataset construction.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor frame selection could lead to missing crucial information; inadequate semantic filtering might retain redundant frames, reducing efficiency; CoT annotations may not fully capture human-like reasoning patterns.
**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study of semantic filtering impact on accuracy and efficiency; 2) Evaluation of frame selection quality through human assessment; 3) Testing robustness on out-of-distribution video content.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on GPT-4o for QA generation and CoT annotation may introduce biases and not fully capture human-like reasoning
- Semantic filtering could inadvertently remove frames with subtle but important information
- The 34.1% average accuracy indicates significant room for improvement in real-world applications

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The dataset construction pipeline and Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework are well-defined and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The state-of-the-art claims are supported by experiments across 14 tasks, though the relatively low average accuracy (34.1%) indicates the approach is promising but not yet highly reliable
- **Low Confidence**: The long-term generalizability of the approach to diverse real-world scenarios remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of the semantic-aware core frame selection versus other components of the framework
2. Test the approach on out-of-distribution video content (e.g., different domains, quality, or length) to assess robustness
3. Perform human evaluation of the CoT annotations to validate their alignment with human reasoning processes and identify potential systematic biases in the GPT-4o generated explanations
