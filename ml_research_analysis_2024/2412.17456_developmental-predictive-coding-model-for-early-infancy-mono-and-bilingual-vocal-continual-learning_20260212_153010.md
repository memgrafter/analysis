# Developmental Predictive Coding Model for Early Infancy Mono and Bilingual Vocal Continual Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17456
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17456
- Reference count: 36
- One-line primary result: Model demonstrates online learning advantages and replicates perceptual narrowing effects in early infancy speech sound learning

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a small-sized generative neural network with continual learning based on predictive coding for early infancy speech sound learning. The model uses a self-organizing map (SOM) layer to encode MFCC inputs into fixed neurons, adding new neurons when variance drops below a threshold to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that second language acquisition during later infancy presents greater challenges compared to early infancy learning, replicating the perceptual narrowing effect. The model excels at capturing inherent differences between languages while continuously updating with new data.

## Method Summary
The model employs a predictive coding-based continual learning approach using a small generative neural network with a self-organizing map (SOM) layer. MFCC vectors (20-dimensional) from speech data are encoded into a SOM with initially 2000 neurons, which dynamically expands when variance of neuron activity falls below 0.00002. The model operates in two modes: continual learning (CL) with predictive coding for online adaptation, and compositional optimization (CO) for later-infancy sound reproduction. The system is trained on 16 minutes of English speech (L1) and 8 minutes each of French/Chinese (L2), measuring reconstruction error between input and output MFCCs.

## Key Results
- Model demonstrates online learning advantages by continuously updating with new data and adapting to changing inputs
- Second language acquisition during later infancy presents greater challenges compared to early infancy learning, replicating perceptual narrowing effects
- Compositional optimization mode shows improved performance with greater number of constituents but requires further optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The SOM layer captures speech sound clusters and reduces catastrophic forgetting.
- Mechanism: SOM encodes MFCC inputs into fixed neurons; when variance drops below threshold, new neurons are added to encode novel sounds without overwriting old representations.
- Core assumption: Variance of SOM neuron activity reliably indicates novelty vs. learned inputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Models excel at capturing inherent differences between languages.
  - Error decreases over time, with mean error among 41000 inputs approaching 0.
- Break condition: If threshold for adding neurons is too high, new sounds overwrite existing ones, causing catastrophic forgetting.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Predictive coding via continual learning enables real-time adaptation to new speech inputs.
- Mechanism: SOM acts as static mapper; errors between predicted and actual MFCC are propagated to adjust generative decoder weights over time.
- Core assumption: Minimizing prediction error improves reproduction of speech sounds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Model continuously updates with new data, making it adaptable and responsive to changing inputs.
  - Continual learning is fundamental to predictive coding, allowing adaptation and improvement based on new sensory input.
- Break condition: If prediction error is not properly minimized, system fails to reproduce accurate speech sounds.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Compositional optimization models later infancy imitation using combinations of earlier-learned sound constituents.
- Mechanism: Decoder reconstructs sounds by composing outputs from N highest-activity neurons, weighted by learned coefficients, without updating SOM.
- Core assumption: Later-acquired sounds are built from combinations of earlier-learned sound elements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Later-learned sounds are generated based on compositional nature of sounds acquired during critical developmental periods.
  - Replication of later-acquired sounds relies on accumulation of various sound elements from crucial developmental period in early life.
- Break condition: If number of constituents N is too small, model cannot reconstruct complex later-acquired sounds.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
  - Why needed here: MFCCs provide compact, perceptually relevant representation of speech sounds suitable for small neural networks
  - Quick check question: What is the dimensionality of the MFCC vectors used in this model?

- Concept: Self-organizing maps (SOMs)
  - Why needed here: SOMs provide topology-preserving encoding of high-dimensional speech inputs into lower-dimensional space, enabling clustering and novelty detection
  - Quick check question: How does the SOM determine which neuron is the best-matching unit for a given input?

- Concept: Predictive coding
  - Why needed here: Predictive coding allows model to learn by minimizing difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs, enabling continual adaptation
  - Quick check question: What role does prediction error play in updating the model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (MFCC) -> SOM layer (Y, 2000 neurons) -> Dynamic layer (Z, variable neurons) -> Decoder weights (W2, W3) -> Reconstructed MFCC
- Critical path:
  1. Encode MFCC → SOM activation
  2. SOM output → Z neuron activation
  3. Z activation → Reconstructed MFCC via decoder
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Small SOM size (2000 neurons) vs. risk of under-representation
  - Fixed vs. dynamic Z layer size for adaptability
  - Predictive coding (online) vs. compositional optimization (offline)
- Failure signatures:
  - High reconstruction error indicates poor encoding or decoding
  - Catastrophic forgetting if new sounds overwrite old neuron activations
  - Poor adaptation if prediction error is not minimized
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train SOM on 16 minutes of English MFCCs; verify clustering and reconstruction error decrease
  2. Compare CL vs. CO modes on French/Chinese L2 reconstruction; measure error trends
  3. Test catastrophic forgetting by training on L1 then L2; compare L1 reconstruction before/after

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the variance threshold for neuron addition in the SOM layer affect the model's ability to generalize across different languages?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that increasing threshold value enhances dynamism of layer Z but exacerbates problem of poor generalization.
- Why unresolved: Paper does not provide experimental results or detailed analysis on impact of different threshold values on generalization performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments with varying threshold values and their effects on model performance across multiple languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the model's performance in second language (L2) acquisition be improved by optimizing the number of constituents in the compositional optimization (CO) mode?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that performance tends to enhance with greater number of constituents but does not optimize this parameter.
- Why unresolved: Study does not explore relationship between number of constituents and model performance in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying number of constituents and measuring their impact on L2 acquisition performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle phoneme sets that differ significantly between L1 and L2, especially in tonal languages like Chinese?
- Basis in paper: Paper mentions intention to develop model for language sound sequence learning, focusing on varying phoneme-sets and tonal variations, but does not address this in current study.
- Why unresolved: Current experiments do not include languages with significantly different phoneme sets or tonal variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating languages with diverse phoneme sets and tonal variations.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the impact of the model's online learning capability on its ability to adapt to new linguistic data compared to traditional offline training methods?
- Basis in paper: Paper highlights advantages of online learning in adapting to changing inputs but does not compare it directly with offline training methods.
- Why unresolved: Study does not include comparison between online and offline learning approaches in terms of adaptability to new data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating model's performance with both online and offline learning when exposed to new linguistic data.

## Limitations

- Limited dataset: Model tested on only 16 minutes of English plus 8 minutes each of French and Chinese speech data
- Catastrophic forgetting evaluation: Limited to comparing reconstruction errors without examining long-term retention
- Compositional optimization assumption: Assumes later-acquired sounds can be built from earlier-learned constituents without empirical validation with infant speech data

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Model successfully demonstrates online learning capabilities and continuous adaptation to new speech inputs through predictive coding mechanisms
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that second language acquisition is more challenging during later infancy is supported by error trends, but replication of perceptual narrowing effects needs more rigorous validation
- **Low confidence**: Compositional optimization mechanism's ability to model later infancy imitation based on earlier sound constituents is theoretically plausible but lacks direct empirical support

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion**: Validate model's performance on larger, more diverse speech dataset (e.g., TIMIT or similar) to assess generalization beyond current limited corpus

2. **Long-term Retention Test**: Implement longitudinal study where model learns L1 sounds, then L2 sounds, and finally retests L1 reconstruction after extended training on L2 to quantify catastrophic forgetting

3. **Variance Threshold Sensitivity**: Conduct experiments varying neuron addition threshold (0.00002) across orders of magnitude to determine impact on model performance and identify optimal values for different language pairs
