# Re-ENACT: Reinforcement Learning for Emotional Speech Generation using Actor-Critic Strategy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.01892
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01892
- Reference count: 0
- Top-1 accuracy around 75% for salience prediction; preference scores over 50% in A/B tests

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Re-ENACT, the first method to modify prosodic features of speech using actor-critic reinforcement learning for emotion conversion. The approach identifies contiguous segments important for emotion perception using a Markov masking strategy and Bayesian framework, then trains a neural network to predict soft emotion assignments and sample mask segments. The prosody modifier uses reinforcement learning to predict modification factors for pitch, intensity, and rhythm, discretizing the modification space. Experiments on the VESUS corpus show the method achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised emotion conversion models.

## Method Summary
The method consists of two main components: a salience predictor and a reinforcement learning-based prosody modifier. The salience predictor uses a neural network with a mask generator module that estimates Bernoulli random variables over speech features, constrained by a first-order Markov prior to ensure temporal continuity. This identifies contiguous segments important for emotion perception. The prosody modifier then uses actor-critic reinforcement learning to predict modification factors for pitch, intensity, and rhythm. The RL agent treats the WSOLA (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add) algorithm as part of the environment since it's non-differentiable. The modification space is discretized to enable gradient-free optimization, with the RL reward signal based on the salience predictor's emotion classification output.

## Key Results
- Salience predictor achieves approximately 75% top-1 accuracy on VESUS corpus
- A/B tests show preference scores over 50% compared to baselines
- Method achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised emotion conversion models
- Markov masking strategy successfully identifies contiguous segments for targeted prosodic modification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Markov Masking for Segment Identification
The Markov masking strategy with Bayesian inference identifies contiguous speech segments most relevant to emotion perception, enabling targeted prosodic modification. A neural network predicts Bernoulli random variables for each frame, constrained by a first-order Markov prior that ensures temporal continuity. The prior enforces similarity between adjacent masks, naturally producing contiguous regions rather than isolated frames. This works because human perception of emotion depends on contiguous segments (syllables/words) rather than isolated frames, and these segments can be identified through a probabilistic masking approach.

### Mechanism 2: RL for Non-Differentiable Optimization
Reinforcement learning with actor-critic strategy enables gradient-free optimization of prosodic modification factors despite WSOLA's non-differentiability. The RL agent learns a policy to predict modification factors (pitch, intensity, rhythm) by treating WSOLA as part of the environment. The reward signal measures emotion conversion success without requiring backpropagation through WSOLA. This works because discretizing the modification space and using RL avoids the need for differentiable rhythm modification while still achieving effective emotion conversion.

### Mechanism 3: Salience Predictor as Reward Signal
Training a salience predictor on crowd-sourced emotion annotations creates a reliable feedback signal for reinforcement learning to optimize emotion conversion. The salience predictor network uses the Markov masking strategy to identify important segments and predicts soft emotion assignments based on AMT annotations, providing the reward signal for RL training. This works because crowd-sourced emotion annotations provide a valid ground truth for training a salience predictor that can guide RL-based emotion conversion.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bayesian inference and variational approximation**: Needed to estimate posterior distribution over binary mask variables using variational inference with mean-field approximation. Quick check: Can you explain why we use KL divergence between the variational posterior and the Markov prior in the masking strategy?

- **Reinforcement learning and policy gradient methods**: Needed because standard supervised learning cannot optimize prosodic modification when WSOLA is non-differentiable, so RL provides a way to learn modification policies without requiring gradients through the modification operation. Quick check: What is the advantage of using actor-critic over pure policy gradient in this application?

- **Speech signal processing and prosody modification**: Needed to understand pitch, intensity, and rhythm modification requires knowledge of speech signal characteristics and how WSOLA works for time-scale modification. Quick check: How does WSOLA differ from simple overlap-add in terms of phase continuity and quality of modified speech?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Feature extractor → Mask generator (Markov Bernoulli variables) → Salience prediction (emotion classification) → RL agent (State → Policy network → Action → WSOLA modification → Reward)

- **Critical path**: Speech signal → Salience predictor (identify important segments) → RL agent (predict modification factors) → WSOLA (apply modifications) → Modified speech

- **Design tradeoffs**: Discretizing modification space vs. continuous control (discretization enables RL but may limit expressiveness); Markov prior strength vs. segment size (stronger priors produce larger segments but may miss important details); Reward signal quality vs. training stability (more accurate rewards improve conversion but may make RL training harder)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor emotion conversion despite good salience prediction (RL agent not learning effective modification policies); Modified speech sounds unnatural (WSOLA parameters or modification factors need adjustment); Training instability (reward signal too noisy or modification space too large)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train salience predictor on VESUS and evaluate emotion recognition accuracy to verify it provides reasonable feedback; 2) Test WSOLA modification with fixed factors on sample speech to ensure it works correctly before adding RL; 3) Run RL training with a simplified setup (fewer modification factors, smaller dataset) to verify the complete pipeline works before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can the proposed reinforcement learning approach be extended to handle continuous action spaces for prosody modification factors instead of the current discretized approach?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper mentions that the space of modification factors is discretized into a range of 0.25-1.9 in steps of 0.15 for simplification, but notes that this approach may introduce artifacts and limits fine-grained control.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not explore or evaluate continuous action spaces, which could potentially provide smoother and more precise prosody modifications.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimental results comparing the performance of the proposed method using continuous action spaces versus the discretized approach in terms of emotion conversion accuracy, naturalness of the modified speech, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the proposed salience prediction network be improved to better handle cases where multiple emotions have similar saliency scores, leading to ambiguity in emotion classification?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper mentions that the top-2 accuracy is higher than the top-1 accuracy, indicating that there are cases where multiple emotions have similar saliency scores. Additionally, the confusion matrices show that certain emotion pairs (e.g., fear and sadness) are more likely to be confused.
- **Why unresolved**: The current salience prediction network uses a softmax layer for emotion classification, which may not be well-suited for handling ambiguous cases with similar saliency scores across multiple emotions.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative experiments evaluating the performance of the proposed salience prediction network against alternative approaches, such as multi-label classification or uncertainty estimation techniques, in terms of emotion classification accuracy and robustness to ambiguous cases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can the proposed method be adapted to handle cross-speaker emotion conversion, where the source and target emotions are expressed by different speakers?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper focuses on modifying the prosody of a given speech utterance to increase the target emotion score, but does not address the scenario where the source and target emotions are expressed by different speakers.
- **Why unresolved**: Cross-speaker emotion conversion is a challenging problem that requires accounting for differences in speaker characteristics, such as voice quality and speaking style, in addition to the target emotion.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in cross-speaker emotion conversion scenarios, evaluated using objective metrics (e.g., emotion classification accuracy, speaker similarity measures) and subjective listening tests.

## Limitations

- The Markov masking strategy's effectiveness in identifying perceptually relevant segments lacks direct human validation
- Discretization of modification space may limit expressiveness and introduce artifacts
- Evaluation is limited to the VESUS corpus without cross-dataset generalization testing

## Confidence

- **Medium** for the core RL-based emotion conversion approach. The paper demonstrates on-par performance with supervised methods, but the ablation studies are incomplete.
- **Low** for the Markov masking strategy's effectiveness in identifying perceptually relevant segments. While the paper claims this approach identifies "contiguous segments important for emotion perception," there's limited direct validation that the identified segments actually correspond to what humans perceive as emotion-relevant.
- **Medium** for the reinforcement learning framework's necessity. The paper argues that RL is needed due to WSOLA's non-differentiability, but doesn't explore whether simpler approaches might work as well or better.

## Next Checks

1. **Perceptual Validation of Masked Segments**: Conduct a human study where participants identify emotion-relevant segments in speech, then compare these to the segments identified by the Markov masking strategy.

2. **Ablation on Modification Discretization**: Systematically vary the discretization granularity of pitch, intensity, and rhythm modification factors to determine the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and RL tractability.

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test the trained salience predictor and RL agent on held-out data from CREMA-D or other emotional speech datasets not seen during training.
