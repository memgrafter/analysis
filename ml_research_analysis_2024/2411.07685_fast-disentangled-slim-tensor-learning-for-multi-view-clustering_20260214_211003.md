# Fast Disentangled Slim Tensor Learning for Multi-view Clustering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.07685
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07685
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DSTL achieves state-of-the-art multi-view clustering performance while being more memory-efficient than tensor-based approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes DSTL, a fast multi-view clustering method that addresses the limitations of existing tensor-based approaches. DSTL directly explores high-order correlations among multi-view latent semantic representations using matrix factorization, instead of focusing on multi-view graph structures. To mitigate the negative influence of feature redundancy, DSTL disentangles the latent low-dimensional representation into a semantic-unrelated part and a semantic-related part for each view, inspired by robust PCA. Subsequently, two slim tensors are constructed with tensor-based regularization. The semantic-related representations are aligned across views through a consensus alignment indicator to further enhance the quality of feature disentanglement. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of DSTL over state-of-the-art approaches.

## Method Summary
DSTL is a multi-view clustering method that improves upon tensor-based approaches by operating directly on low-dimensional latent representations rather than full affinity matrices. The method uses matrix factorization to obtain semantic-related and semantic-unrelated representations for each view, then constructs slim tensors with tensor-based regularization. A consensus alignment indicator is learned to align semantic-related representations across views, which also guides the feature disentanglement process. The approach is validated on nine benchmark datasets and shows superior clustering performance while being more memory-efficient than existing methods.

## Key Results
- DSTL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nine benchmark datasets across multiple metrics (ACC, NMI, PUR, ARI, F-score)
- The method achieves better clustering accuracy while being more computationally efficient than traditional tensor-based approaches
- DSTL demonstrates superior performance in handling feature redundancy through its disentanglement mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Directly learning latent semantic representations avoids the high space complexity of stacking affinity matrices into tensors.
- Mechanism: Instead of constructing similarity graphs for each view and stacking them into a three-order tensor, the method directly performs matrix factorization on each view's data to obtain low-dimensional semantic-related and semantic-unrelated representations, then constructs slim tensors from these representations.
- Core assumption: The low-dimensional latent representations preserve sufficient cross-view correlation information for effective clustering while being much more compact than full affinity matrices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Instead of concentrating on the multi-view graph structures, the DSTL approach directly leverages the matrix factorization technique to obtain low-dimensional features."
  - [section] "Our method directly operates on latent low-dimensional features, which have a linear space complexity of O(n), making it more memory-efficient and scalable to larger datasets."
- Break condition: If the matrix factorization fails to capture sufficient cross-view correlation structure, the slim tensor regularization cannot recover the lost information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Disentangling semantic-related and semantic-unrelated representations mitigates the negative impact of irrelevant features.
- Mechanism: The method applies RPCA-inspired decomposition to separate each view's latent representation into sparse semantic-unrelated and low-rank semantic-related components, with different regularization terms applied to each.
- Core assumption: Semantic-unrelated information is sparse and can be effectively isolated through ℓ1-norm regularization, while semantic-related information is low-rank and captures the meaningful structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To alleviate the negative influence of feature redundancy, inspired by robust PCA, DSTL disentangles the latent low-dimensional representation into a semantic-unrelated part and a semantic-related part for each view."
  - [section] "Inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), we disentangle the features of each view to learn both semantic-unrelated and semantic-related representations."
- Break condition: If semantic-unrelated information is not actually sparse or semantic-related information is not actually low-rank, the disentanglement will fail to isolate the correct components.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consensus alignment indicator guides the disentanglement process and ensures semantic consistency across views.
- Mechanism: A probability-based alignment matrix Y is learned to align semantic-related representations across views, which then guides the feature disentanglement by encouraging consistency in the semantic-related components.
- Core assumption: The same object should belong to the same cluster across all views, and this consistency can be captured through alignment of the semantic-related representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The semantic-related representations are aligned across views through a consensus alignment indicator to further enhance the quality of feature disentanglement."
  - [section] "we learn a consensus alignment indicator Y ∈ Rk×n to align semantic-related representations across all views, and it also reversely guide the process of feature disentanglement"
- Break condition: If the alignment constraint is too strict or too loose, it may either force incorrect alignment or fail to provide useful guidance for disentanglement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor nuclear norm and t-SVD
  - Why needed here: The method uses t-SVD based tensor nuclear norm regularization to encourage low-rank structure in the semantic-related slim tensor.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between traditional matrix nuclear norm and tensor nuclear norm as defined in this paper?

- Concept: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)
  - Why needed here: The feature disentanglement approach is inspired by RPCA, which decomposes data into sparse noise and low-rank components.
  - Quick check question: How does RPCA's assumption about data structure (sparse noise + low-rank signal) apply to the multi-view clustering setting?

- Concept: Matrix factorization with orthogonality constraints
  - Why needed here: The base matrix Wv is constrained to be orthogonal to avoid arbitrary scaling during the factorization process.
  - Quick check question: Why is orthogonality constraint important in the matrix factorization step, and what would happen without it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data matrices → Matrix factorization → Disentangled representations (S_v, H_v) → Slim tensors (S, H) → Consensus alignment (Y) → Clustering
- Critical path: Matrix factorization → Slim tensor regularization → Consensus alignment → Final clustering
- Design tradeoffs: Space efficiency (slim tensors) vs. potential information loss from dimensionality reduction; disentanglement quality vs. computational complexity
- Failure signatures: Poor clustering performance despite convergence; sensitivity to parameter choices; memory issues with large datasets
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run with λ1=0 to verify disentanglement improves over no-disentanglement baseline
  2. Compare slim tensor approach against traditional tensor stacking on a medium-sized dataset
  3. Test convergence behavior with different initialization strategies for the alignment indicator Y

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several limitations are mentioned in the discussion section, including the method's struggle with incomplete multi-view data and the need for further exploration of parameter sensitivity.

## Limitations

- The method's performance on incomplete multi-view data is not well-established, as it struggles when some views are missing for certain samples
- The optimal number of clusters (k) is assumed to be known and equal to the true number of clusters, without exploring sensitivity to this parameter
- While computational efficiency is claimed, the method has not been tested on extremely large-scale datasets with millions of samples or features

## Confidence

- High confidence: Space complexity claims (O(n) vs O(n²)), experimental methodology and dataset descriptions
- Medium confidence: The core mechanism of disentanglement improving clustering quality, the effectiveness of consensus alignment across views
- Low confidence: Claims about the superiority of tensor nuclear norm regularization over traditional approaches, generalization to datasets outside the tested domains

## Next Checks

1. **Dimensionality Sensitivity Test**: Systematically evaluate clustering performance across different latent dimensionalities to verify the claim that low-dimensional representations preserve sufficient correlation structure for effective clustering.
2. **Ablation Study on Disentanglement**: Implement a variant without the semantic-unrelated/semantic-related decomposition to quantitatively assess whether the RPCA-inspired disentanglement actually improves clustering performance versus simple dimensionality reduction.
3. **Scalability Benchmark**: Test the method on progressively larger datasets (beyond the provided benchmarks) to empirically verify the claimed space efficiency and computational scalability advantages.
