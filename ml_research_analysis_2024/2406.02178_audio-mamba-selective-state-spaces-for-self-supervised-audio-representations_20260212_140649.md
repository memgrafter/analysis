# Audio Mamba: Selective State Spaces for Self-Supervised Audio Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02178
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Audio Mamba achieves ~30% relative improvement over SSAST baselines across 10 downstream tasks while using fewer parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Audio Mamba, a selective state space model for learning general-purpose audio representations through self-supervised pretraining on AudioSet. By replacing the attention mechanism in transformers with Mamba's selective state space modeling, the authors demonstrate superior performance on diverse downstream audio recognition tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed models consistently outperform comparable SSAST baselines despite having fewer parameters, suggesting that SSMs may be better suited for audio spectrogram processing than traditional attention-based approaches.

## Method Summary
Audio Mamba learns audio representations by pretraining on AudioSet using masked spectrogram modeling. The model processes log-mel spectrograms by creating non-overlapping patches, applying linear projection, and adding sinusoidal positional embeddings. A Mamba encoder with expansion factor E=3 and wider blocks processes the sequence, followed by an MLP reconstruction head during pretraining. The model is trained with 50% random masking and MSE loss for 100 epochs. Downstream evaluation follows the HEAR protocol using a single hidden layer MLP classifier on fixed-size feature vectors extracted from 2-second audio chunks.

## Key Results
- Audio Mamba outperforms SSAST baselines by ~30% relative improvement in aggregate performance across multiple model configurations
- Models demonstrate better performance with smaller dataset sizes (10% vs 100% of AudioSet) and longer sequence lengths
- Parameter efficiency: Audio Mamba achieves superior results despite having fewer parameters than comparable SSAST models
- Consistent improvements across 10 diverse downstream tasks from the HEAR benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Mamba's selective state space modeling achieves linear time complexity while maintaining strong long-range sequence modeling, outperforming attention-based transformers for audio spectrograms. The model computes state space representations through selective parameters (B, C, ∆) that are conditioned on input content, enabling efficient convolution-like processing without quadratic attention overhead.

### Mechanism 2
Masked spectrogram modeling with Mamba effectively learns general-purpose audio representations through reconstruction objectives. Randomly masking 50% of spectrogram patches forces the model to learn robust contextual representations by reconstructing missing information, similar to masked language modeling but adapted for audio.

### Mechanism 3
Wider Mamba blocks with expansion factor E=3 provide better parameter efficiency compared to standard transformers for audio representation learning. Using larger internal dimensions with expansion factor E=3 creates Mamba blocks closer in parameter count to transformer blocks while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning

- **State Space Models and discretization**: Understanding how continuous differential equations are discretized into efficient computational kernels is fundamental to grasping Mamba's operation. Quick check: What mathematical transformation converts the continuous state space equations into the discrete convolution operation used in Mamba?

- **Masked predictive modeling objectives**: The reconstruction objective drives the self-supervised learning process and determines what features the model learns to represent. Quick check: How does the 50% masking ratio affect the trade-off between reconstruction difficulty and learned representation quality?

- **Spectrogram representation and patch embedding**: Audio data is transformed into 2D spectrograms, and understanding how these are chunked into patches affects model design and performance. Quick check: Why might different patch sizes (4×8 vs 4×16) lead to different frequency vs time resolution trade-offs in the learned representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Log-mel spectrograms → Non-overlapping patches → Linear projection → Sinusoidal positional embeddings → Class token → Stacked Mamba blocks with expansion factor E=3 → Latent representations → (optional reconstruction) → Downstream classifier

- **Critical path**: Spectrogram → Patch embedding → Mamba encoder → Latent representation → (optional reconstruction) → Downstream classifier

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Linear vs quadratic complexity: Mamba provides computational efficiency but may sacrifice some modeling capacity compared to attention
  - Masking ratio: 50% balances reconstruction difficulty with information retention
  - Patch size: Affects frequency vs time resolution and sequence length
  - Model width: Wider Mamba blocks improve parameter efficiency but increase memory usage

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor downstream performance despite good reconstruction loss: Indicates learned features may not transfer well
  - Training instability or slow convergence: Could indicate issues with discretization or selective parameter computation
  - Memory overflow with long sequences: May require adjusting discretization parameters or model width

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train SSAM-Tiny vs SSAST-Tiny on AudioSet with default settings to verify the 30% performance improvement claim
  2. Patch size ablation: Test different patch configurations (4×8, 4×16, 8×16) to understand resolution trade-offs
  3. Data efficiency test: Train models with 10%, 25%, and 100% of AudioSet to verify scaling behavior claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do selective state space models (SSMs) compare to transformers in learning audio representations for tasks with highly variable temporal dynamics, such as speech with diverse speaking rates or music with varying tempos? The paper demonstrates SSAM's effectiveness on diverse downstream tasks but does not explicitly explore performance on tasks with extreme temporal variability.

### Open Question 2
Can bidirectional extensions of SSMs, such as Vim blocks, be adapted to improve audio representation learning, considering the unidirectional nature of acoustic elements in spectrograms? The paper investigates bidirectional SSMs but finds they perform worse than unidirectional Mamba blocks for audio tasks.

### Open Question 3
How do SSAM models scale with increasingly larger datasets and longer input sequences, and what are the computational trade-offs compared to transformer-based models? While the paper shows SSAM's scalability, it does not provide a detailed analysis of computational efficiency and resource requirements at larger scales.

## Limitations
- Limited ablation studies on architectural choices, particularly the necessity of wider blocks with E=3
- Weak direct evidence for Mamba's effectiveness on audio tasks specifically, with most support from language modeling applications
- Insufficient analysis of the trade-offs between frequency and time resolution when varying patch sizes

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Baseline comparison showing consistent performance improvements across multiple configurations
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about parameter efficiency and computational advantages supported by aggregate performance but lacking detailed complexity analysis
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims across different dataset sizes and sequence lengths based on limited experiments

## Next Checks

1. **Architectural Ablation**: Systematically test the impact of the expansion factor E=3 and wider blocks by comparing standard Mamba configurations against the proposed architecture across all model sizes

2. **Masking Ratio Sensitivity**: Conduct experiments with different masking ratios (30%, 50%, 70%) to determine the optimal balance between reconstruction difficulty and representation quality

3. **Feature Transfer Analysis**: Compare learned representations from Audio Mamba against SSAST using canonical correlation analysis or similar techniques to understand what features are being captured differently
