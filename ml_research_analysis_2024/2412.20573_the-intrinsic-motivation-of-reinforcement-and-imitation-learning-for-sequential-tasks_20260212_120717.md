# The intrinsic motivation of reinforcement and imitation learning for sequential tasks

## Quick Facts

- This thesis proposes a framework for developmental cognitive robotics that bridges reinforcement learning and imitation learning using intrinsic motivation

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents a framework for developmental cognitive robotics that unifies reinforcement learning and imitation learning through intrinsic motivation based on empirical progress. The approach enables learning agents to automatically select their learning curriculum, deciding what task to learn, whether to explore autonomously or imitate, and which tutor to learn from. The framework is particularly focused on sequential tasks and has been applied to socially assistive robotics for physical rehabilitation and autism spectrum disorder interventions. By using a common progress-based reward signal across different learning strategies, the framework reduces reliance on demonstration quality and enables more efficient learning with fewer demonstrations.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a multi-arm bandit algorithm with intrinsic motivation criteria based on empirical learning progress to select learning strategies and tasks. The intrinsic motivation score im(σ, ω) = κ(σ) * progress(σ, ω) guides the learner to choose between autonomous exploration, mimicry, emulation, and task decomposition strategies. The system learns hierarchical task representations where complex tasks can be decomposed into simpler subtasks, enabling knowledge transfer. Active imitation learning allows the robot to request demonstrations from the most effective tutor for each task based on competence progress. The approach operates in continuous sensorimotor spaces and uses Markov Decision Processes as the underlying framework for learning policies.

## Key Results
- A common formulation of intrinsic motivation based on empirical progress enables automatic curriculum selection for both simple and sequential tasks
- The framework allows robots to actively request tutoring when beneficial, reducing reliance on demonstration quality
- SGIM-PB algorithm outperforms standard approaches on complex outcome spaces through task decomposition and hierarchical learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework unifies autonomous exploration and social guidance through a common intrinsic motivation based on empirical progress.
- Mechanism: The learner chooses between autonomous exploration and imitation learning strategies by computing an intrinsic motivation score im(σ, ω) = κ(σ) * progress(σ, ω), where progress measures learning improvement and κ(σ) represents the cost of querying a tutor.
- Core assumption: Empirical progress can serve as a universal reward signal across different learning strategies, including both autonomous exploration and social guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "propose a common formulation of intrinsic motivation based on empirical progress for a learning agent to choose automatically its learning curriculum"
  - [section 3.5]: "the same formulation of the intrinsic motivation is valid both for autonomous exploration and for social guidance"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss reinforcement learning and imitation but don't specifically address the unified progress-based formulation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Active imitation learning enables the robot to learn more efficiently by choosing when, what, and whom to imitate based on learning progress.
- Mechanism: The learner actively queries demonstrations from the most effective tutor for each task by evaluating the competence progress enabled by each teacher, weighted by the cost of interaction.
- Core assumption: The learner can accurately estimate the competence progress enabled by different teachers and strategies, and that different teachers have specialized expertise for different tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 1.4.1]: "Our works [Nguyen and Oudeyer, 2012d; Duminy et al., 2019, 2021] make the most of several teachers by choosing the expert for each query based on the competence progress each teacher has enabled"
  - [section 3.4]: "our robot learned to ask demonstrations of motor policies for simple tasks and to ask demonstrations of task decomposition for sequential tasks [Duminy et al., 2018b]"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss imitation learning but focus on algorithmic approaches rather than active selection of teachers

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Learning hierarchical task representations enables transfer of knowledge from simple to complex tasks, allowing efficient learning of sequential/compositional tasks.
- Mechanism: The framework represents tasks as decomposable into subtasks, learning both the policies for simple tasks and the relationships between tasks to compose complex tasks through knowledge transfer.
- Core assumption: Complex tasks can be effectively decomposed into simpler subtasks, and knowledge of these relationships enables efficient learning of new complex tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1]: "Our robot can perform sequences of primitive actions... A hierarchical description of actions has been proposed in neuroscience... Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) [Barto and Mahadevan, 2003] is a recent approach for learning to solve long and complex tasks by decomposing them into simpler subtasks"
  - [section 3.4]: "SGIM-PB outperforms SGIM-ACTS on the most complex outcome spaces, owing to task decomposition which enables it to learn and exploit the task hierarchy"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss hierarchical reinforcement learning but don't specifically address the decomposition framework presented here

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their extension to continuous state/action spaces
  - Why needed here: The framework operates in continuous sensorimotor spaces where the robot must learn policies mapping states to actions
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a continuous MDP from a discrete MDP in terms of policy representation and learning algorithms?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning fundamentals (value functions, policy gradients, Q-learning)
  - Why needed here: The framework uses RL as a foundation for autonomous exploration and for framing interaction with tutors
  - Quick check question: How does the concept of "intrinsic motivation" differ from the standard RL reward signal in terms of source and computation?

- Concept: Machine learning generalization and transfer learning
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on transferring knowledge from simple tasks to complex tasks and from demonstrations to new contexts
  - Quick check question: What factors determine whether knowledge transfer will be beneficial versus harmful when learning new tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Task representation layer: defines tasks as mappings from controllable space C to outcome space Ω
  - Strategy selection module: computes im(σ, ω) scores to choose between exploration, mimicry, emulation, and task decomposition
  - Model hierarchy H: directed graph of tasks and their relationships
  - Teacher selection component: evaluates competence progress from different tutors
  - Competence progress estimator: measures learning improvement over recent episodes
  - Data collection and model update pipeline: executes chosen strategy and updates models

- Critical path: Strategy selection → Teacher/task selection → Data collection → Model update → Competence estimation → Strategy selection (loop)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity of task decomposition vs. learning complexity
  - Exploration vs. exploitation in teacher selection
  - Computational cost of competence progress estimation vs. selection accuracy
  - Fixed vs. adaptive cost coefficients κ(σ) for different strategies

- Failure signatures:
  - Learner gets stuck in local optima (may need more exploration)
  - Learner queries too many/few demonstrations (may need cost function adjustment)
  - Competence progress estimates are noisy or unreliable (may need better estimation methods)
  - Hierarchical task representation becomes too complex to manage (may need abstraction mechanisms)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simple parametrized task learning with one teacher: Validate basic SGIM framework on a single continuous task with demonstrations
  2. Multi-teacher comparison: Test teacher selection mechanism with tutors of varying expertise levels
  3. Hierarchical task composition: Verify knowledge transfer from simple to complex tasks through decomposition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can intrinsic motivation criteria be extended beyond learning progress to incorporate other motivational drives such as homeostatic drives in human-robot interaction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions expanding beyond intrinsic motivation based on learning progress to consider other intrinsic motivations such as homeostatic drives in section 5.3.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes to analyze human behavior in coaching situations to enrich the formulation of the cost coefficient, but does not provide concrete methods or evidence for incorporating these additional motivational drives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing how different motivational drives (e.g., homeostatic, social, emotional) influence human-robot interaction in coaching scenarios, and mathematical models integrating these drives into the intrinsic motivation framework.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the emerging discrete representation of tasks be used to improve communication between robots and humans in natural language interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for a discrete representation of tasks in a continuous environment to enable efficient communication between learners and tutors in section 5.2.2.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights the importance of symbolic representation for goal representation in hierarchical reinforcement learning, it does not provide specific methods for translating this representation into natural language interactions with humans.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementations of robot systems that use emerging discrete task representations to understand and generate natural language instructions or feedback from humans, demonstrated through user studies or real-world applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework of socially guided intrinsic motivation be scaled to handle open-ended learning in high-dimensional, real-world environments with complex task hierarchies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of current hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches in scaling to environments with complex task hierarchies in section 5.2.2.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes algorithms like STAR for goal-conditioned hierarchical learning, it does not address the scalability challenges of applying these methods to real-world, high-dimensional environments with unknown task hierarchies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful applications of the socially guided intrinsic motivation framework to real-world robotic systems learning complex, open-ended tasks in dynamic environments, with quantitative comparisons to state-of-the-art methods in terms of learning efficiency and task performance.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes tasks can be effectively decomposed into simpler subtasks, which may not hold for all real-world scenarios
- Competence progress estimation may become unreliable in noisy or high-dimensional environments
- The cost function κ(σ) for different strategies is fixed rather than learned, potentially limiting adaptability

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical formulation of intrinsic motivation as progress × cost is well-defined and internally consistent
- **Medium confidence**: The framework's effectiveness for hierarchical task learning and teacher selection is supported by experimental results, but implementation details are sparse
- **Low confidence**: Claims about applications to autism spectrum disorder and physical rehabilitation lack detailed validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework's robustness to noisy competence progress estimates by adding controlled noise to the learning signals
2. Evaluate teacher selection performance when multiple tutors have overlapping expertise domains
3. Assess the framework's ability to handle tasks that resist clean hierarchical decomposition
