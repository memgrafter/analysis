# Evaluating the Prompt Steerability of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.12405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12405
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLM steerability using persona-based prompt steering, revealing asymmetric steerability patterns and internal rigid baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating how easily large language models can be steered to adopt different personas using only prompt-based steering. The authors formalize prompt steerability by measuring how a model's joint behavioral distribution shifts from a baseline profile when prompted with persona statements. Using a dataset of persona statements, they measure steerability along multiple dimensions (e.g., agreeableness, political views, ethics) and compute steerability indices that quantify the degree of steering relative to the model's baseline behavior. Experiments on several models reveal that many models are not easily steerable along certain dimensions and directions, with some showing significant asymmetry—often being more easily steered in the negative direction than the positive. The results suggest that models have internal, rigid baseline personas that limit their steerability, posing challenges for building pluralistic AI systems.

## Method Summary
The method measures prompt steerability by constructing behavioral profiles as joint distributions over multiple persona dimensions, then quantifying shifts in these distributions when models are steered with persona statements. The approach uses beta distributions to estimate behavioral probabilities, Wasserstein distance to measure distributional shifts, and steerability indices to quantify the degree of steering relative to baseline behavior. Models are steered by appending persona statements to system prompts, and behavior is measured by asking if the model would generate each statement. The steerability indices reveal both the magnitude and directional asymmetry of steering capabilities across different model architectures and persona dimensions.

## Key Results
- Models exhibit asymmetric steerability, being more easily steered in negative directions than positive for certain dimensions
- Many models resist steering altogether along certain dimensions, suggesting rigid internal baseline personas
- More sophisticated models plateau sooner in steerability curves, indicating easier steering with fewer examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Steerability can be measured by quantifying shifts in a model's behavioral distribution when prompted with persona statements.
- Mechanism: The model's behavior is represented as a joint distribution (evaluation profile) computed from score functions applied to model outputs. Steerability indices measure the distance between baseline and steered profiles using Wasserstein distance.
- Core assumption: The joint distribution representation accurately captures behavioral changes relevant to persona adoption.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "formalize prompt steerability by measuring how a model's joint behavioral distribution shifts from a baseline profile when prompted with persona statements"
  - [section] "Define the positively and negatively steered profiles along di... A model's prompt steerability along di is the degree to which (pi+ X, pi- X) can be pulled away from pX"
- Break condition: If the score functions fail to capture meaningful behavioral dimensions or if the Wasserstein distance metric does not reflect practical steerability differences.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models exhibit asymmetric steerability, being more easily steered in negative directions than positive for certain dimensions.
- Mechanism: The steerability indices γi,k reveal directional asymmetry by comparing the shift from baseline to positively/negatively steered profiles relative to maximum possible steering.
- Core assumption: The asymmetry in steerability indices reflects genuine limitations in model behavior rather than artifacts of the measurement method.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "many models are not easily steerable along certain dimensions and directions, with some showing significant asymmetry—often being more easily steered in the negative direction than the positive"
  - [section] "Define steerability indices γ+, γ-... as γ+ = (W(pX, p~X+) - W(pX+,k, p~X+))/W(p~X+, p~X-)... γ- = (W(pX, p~X-) - W(pX-,k, p~X-))/W(p~X+, p~X-)"
- Break condition: If the measurement captures artifacts rather than genuine behavioral asymmetry, such as through biased persona statements or flawed scoring functions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: More sophisticated models plateau sooner in steerability curves, indicating easier steering with fewer examples.
- Mechanism: Advanced models develop better internal representations that allow them to infer user intent from fewer steering examples, causing their steerability curves to flatten earlier.
- Core assumption: The plateauing behavior reflects improved inference capabilities rather than other factors like overfitting to steering examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "more advanced models tend to possess steerability curves that both yield higher values (higher degree of steering) and plateau sooner, indicating a greater ease of steering"
  - [abstract] "we can estimate the steerability of a model across various persona dimensions and directions"
- Break condition: If the plateauing occurs due to model overfitting to steering examples rather than genuine understanding, or if the measurement fails to capture the full range of steerability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Joint probability distributions and profile estimation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the model's behavior is represented as a joint distribution across multiple dimensions is fundamental to interpreting steerability measurements
  - Quick check question: How does the beta distribution estimation work when updating α and β based on the model's answers and label confidence?

- Concept: Wasserstein distance as a metric for distribution comparison
  - Why needed here: This metric quantifies how much the model's behavioral distribution shifts when steered, forming the basis for steerability indices
  - Quick check question: What properties make Wasserstein distance suitable for comparing behavioral profiles compared to other distance metrics?

- Concept: Beta distribution posterior updating for behavioral measurement
  - Why needed here: The scoring mechanism relies on updating beta distributions based on model responses to estimate behavioral probabilities along dimensions
  - Quick check question: How does the belief increment δx = 2(cx - 0.5) affect the posterior distribution updates for different label confidence values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preparation -> Persona filtering -> Prompt construction -> Model inference -> Response extraction -> Profile estimation -> Steerability calculation
- Critical path: Data preparation → Prompt construction with steering examples → Model inference → Response extraction → Profile estimation → Steerability calculation
- Design tradeoffs: Using beta distributions provides uncertainty quantification but requires sufficient samples; Wasserstein distance captures distributional shifts but may be computationally intensive
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent profile estimates across trials, asymmetric steering that doesn't match expected behavior, or plateauing steerability curves that don't reflect actual model capabilities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify beta distribution estimation by running the profiling procedure on a known baseline model and checking if estimated probabilities match expected values
  2. Test steerability index calculation by manually constructing simple profile distributions with known distances and verifying the index computation
  3. Validate the prompt steering mechanism by running controlled experiments with synthetic persona statements and verifying the expected directional shifts in model responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do some models show stronger resistance to positive steering than negative steering across multiple persona dimensions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that "many models were more easily steered in the negative direction than the positive direction, with some resisting positive steering on some dimensions altogether."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this asymmetry but does not investigate the underlying mechanisms causing this directional bias in steerability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of model architectures, training data distributions, and fine-tuning procedures to identify systematic differences between positive and negative steering responses.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the fundamental limits of prompt steerability for current LLMs, and how do these limits vary across model scales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the limited extent to which (even current SoTA) models can be steered poses various challenges for building pluralistic AI" and observe that larger models tend to plateau sooner in their steerability curves.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that models have internal rigid personas but doesn't quantify the theoretical or practical bounds of how far this steerability can be pushed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying steering statement quality, quantity, and phrasing across multiple model scales to identify asymptotic steerability limits.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does steerability along one persona dimension relate to steerability along other dimensions, and can we identify correlated or independent steerability patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that "each statement is contained within a single persona dimension split" and that steerability is studied "independently of other dimensions," suggesting this joint steerability remains unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark design, while principled, cannot study joint steerability due to the independence structure of the persona dataset, leaving questions about potential trade-offs or correlations between different steerability dimensions unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of multi-dimensional persona statements and benchmarking that simultaneously steers models across multiple persona dimensions to identify correlation patterns or trade-offs.

## Limitations

- The steerability measurement relies heavily on beta distribution estimation, which may be sensitive to dataset quality and quantity
- Asymmetric steerability findings could reflect biases in the persona dataset rather than genuine model limitations
- Yes/no profiling evaluation may not capture the full complexity of persona adoption in open-ended generation scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The formalization of steerability using Wasserstein distance between behavioral profiles is mathematically sound and well-grounded
- **Medium confidence**: The asymmetric steerability results across models and dimensions are compelling but require additional validation to rule out dataset artifacts
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of yes/no profiling to real-world persona steering scenarios is uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset bias validation**: Analyze the persona statement distribution across dimensions and directions to verify that asymmetric steerability is not an artifact of imbalanced or biased persona statements
2. **Cross-method consistency**: Validate steerability measurements using an alternative evaluation method, such as open-ended generation prompts with human evaluation, to ensure that yes/no profiling captures meaningful behavioral shifts
3. **Temporal stability analysis**: Assess the stability of steerability profiles by measuring consistency across multiple inference runs and different sampling parameters (temperature, top-k)
