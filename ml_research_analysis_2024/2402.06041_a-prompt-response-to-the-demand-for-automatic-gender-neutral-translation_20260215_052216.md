# A Prompt Response to the Demand for Automatic Gender-Neutral Translation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.06041
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06041
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: GPT-4 can generate significant amounts of gender-neutral translations when prompted with a few examples, though quality is subjective and varies across annotators.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the use of large language models, specifically GPT-4, for automating gender-neutral translation. The study compares GPT-4's performance with traditional machine translation systems on the GeNTE test set for English-to-Italian translation. Through manual analysis, the authors find that while neither MT nor GPT-4 performs well on gender-neutral translation out-of-the-box, GPT-4 can generate substantial amounts of neutral translations when provided with a few examples in the prompt. The study also reveals that judging the acceptability of automatic gender-neutral translations is subjective, with notable variations across annotators. The authors release all manual annotations to promote future research in this area.

## Method Summary
The study employs six GPT-4 prompt configurations (contrastive and chain-of-thought templates with seen and non-seen examples) to generate translations for the 750-sentence GeNTE test set. Each configuration uses 3-shot prompting with carefully selected example sentences. The generated outputs undergo post-processing to extract final neutral translations. Manual annotation is performed on 200 randomly selected outputs per configuration, evaluating both neutrality (N/G/P) and acceptability (Acc/S-Acc/S-Un/Un) using predefined guidelines. The results are compared against traditional MT systems and the GeNTE evaluation classifier.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 generates 65-70% neutral (N) and 15% partial (P) translations when prompted with examples
- Neither MT nor baseline GPT-4 perform well on gender-neutral translation out-of-the-box
- Judging acceptability of gender-neutral translations shows notable variation across annotators
- GPT-4 demonstrates ability to generalize to unseen gendered terms across different prompt templates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: GPT-4 can perform gender-neutral translation when provided with few examples in the prompt.
- **Mechanism**: GPT-4's instruction-following capability allows it to adapt to new tasks when given explicit examples of the desired behavior.
- **Core assumption**: GPT-4 can generalize from a small number of examples to unseen cases.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4 can generate significant amounts of neutral translations when prompted with a few examples"
  - [section 4.2] "GPT produces a notable amount of GNTs (~65-70% N and ~15%P)"
- **Break condition**: If the provided examples are too dissimilar from the test cases or if the task requires complex reasoning beyond the model's capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The quality of gender-neutral translations generated by GPT-4 is subjective and varies across annotators.
- **Mechanism**: Gender-neutral translation is an open-ended task with no definitive 'correct' answer, leading to different valid judgments based on individual perspectives.
- **Core assumption**: There is no single standard for what constitutes an acceptable gender-neutral translation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.2] "judging the quality and acceptability of automatic GNT is a subjective task, with notable variations across annotators"
  - [section 4.2] "the qualitative evaluation of GNT emerges as a subjective task, even across annotators with comparable expertise in neutral language"
- **Break condition**: If a more objective evaluation metric is developed or if the task becomes more constrained with specific guidelines.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: GPT-4 can generalize to unseen gendered terms when prompted with examples containing different terms.
- **Mechanism**: GPT-4's ability to understand and apply the underlying pattern of gender-neutral translation, rather than just memorizing specific examples.
- **Core assumption**: The model has learned the concept of gender-neutral language and can apply it to new terms.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.2] "we do not find notable differences across templates for S and NS examples, thus attesting GPT abilities to generalize to newly encountered gendered terms"
- **Break condition**: If the unseen terms are too dissimilar from the seen terms or if the model fails to understand the concept of gender-neutral language.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Gender-neutral language
  - **Why needed here**: The task involves generating translations that avoid gender bias and use neutral terms.
  - **Quick check question**: What are some examples of gendered terms in Italian that would need to be neutralized in translation?

- **Concept**: Prompt engineering
  - **Why needed here**: The effectiveness of GPT-4 in this task depends on how well the prompts are designed.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key components of an effective prompt for this task?

- **Concept**: Evaluation of open-ended generations
  - **Why needed here**: The quality of gender-neutral translations is subjective and requires careful evaluation.
  - **Quick check question**: How would you design an evaluation framework for assessing the quality of gender-neutral translations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input sentence → Prompt generation → GPT-4 generation → Output post-processing → Evaluation
- **Critical path**: The critical path is: input sentence → prompt generation → GPT-4 generation → output post-processing → evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using few-shot prompting balances the need for task-specific guidance with the desire to avoid overfitting to specific examples. Manual evaluation provides nuanced feedback but is time-consuming.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor gender-neutral translations, low inter-annotator agreement, or GPT-4 failing to follow the prompt instructions.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test GPT-4 with different prompt templates to see which yields the best gender-neutral translations.
  2. Evaluate the quality of gender-neutral translations using both automated metrics and manual evaluation.
  3. Investigate GPT-4's ability to generalize to unseen gendered terms by using prompts with different examples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How do human attitudes toward gender-neutral language evolve over time, and how does this affect the acceptability of GNT translations?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses that the acceptability of neutral language is highly dependent on people's attitudes and exposure to such forms, and it is reasonable to expect that they will change over time (Koeser and Sczesny, 2014).
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper acknowledges the variability in human attitudes, it does not provide a longitudinal study or empirical evidence on how these attitudes evolve and impact the acceptability of GNT translations over time.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A longitudinal study tracking changes in human attitudes toward gender-neutral language and correlating these changes with the acceptability of GNT translations would provide insights into this open question.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the optimal number and type of exemplar sentences for prompting GPT-4 to achieve the best GNT performance?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that the authors used 3-shot prompts, but also suggests that a more comprehensive investigation would involve using sentence exemplars from varying domains with more radical structural and stylistic differences.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not explore the impact of using different numbers or types of exemplar sentences on the GNT performance of GPT-4.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with varying numbers and types of exemplar sentences, including those from different domains and with varying structures and styles, would help determine the optimal configuration for achieving the best GNT performance.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the performance of open-source models compare to GPT-4 in terms of GNT capabilities?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that the study relies on closed-source models and plans to test open-source models for this task in the future.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide any comparative analysis between the performance of GPT-4 and open-source models in terms of GNT capabilities.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments comparing the GNT performance of GPT-4 with that of various open-source models would provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these models for GNT tasks.

## Limitations
- Manual evaluation approach introduces variability that cannot be fully controlled
- GeNTE test set represents a specific domain and may not generalize to all translation scenarios
- Study focuses on English-to-Italian translation, limiting claims about performance on other language pairs

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: GPT-4's ability to generate gender-neutral translations when provided with few examples (Mechanism 1). The evidence from quantitative results (65-70% N, 15%P) and the generalization findings are strong and directly supported.
- **Medium confidence**: The subjective nature of gender-neutral translation evaluation (Mechanism 2). While the study clearly demonstrates inter-annotator variation, the lack of objective evaluation standards remains a fundamental challenge for the field.
- **Medium confidence**: GPT-4's ability to generalize to unseen gendered terms (Mechanism 3). The findings are promising but based on limited template variations, and more extensive testing across diverse terms would strengthen this claim.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce generalization findings**: Test GPT-4 with prompts containing examples of gendered terms not present in the original GeNTE test set to verify the claimed ability to generalize to unseen terms across a broader range of vocabulary.

2. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Apply the same few-shot prompting approach to a different language pair (e.g., English-to-Spanish or English-to-French) to assess whether the observed performance generalizes beyond Italian.

3. **Automated evaluation validation**: Compare the manual annotations with the GeNTE classifier outputs on the same subset of 200 outputs to quantify the correlation and assess whether the classifier could serve as a reliable proxy for manual evaluation in future work.
