# Automated Theorem Provers Help Improve Large Language Model Reasoning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.03492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03492
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Combining LLMs with ATPs reduces semantic errors by 88-92% and improves accuracy by 15-30% on PRONTOQA steamroller problems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving logical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). The authors propose a framework where LLMs translate natural language problems into formal logic programs, which are then solved by ATPs. A key contribution is the categorization of translation errors into syntactic, shallow semantic, and deep semantic types, along with the development of the SEDAC algorithm to automatically detect and correct these errors. The approach is evaluated on PRONTOQA steamroller problems, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and error reduction.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves using LLMs to translate natural language problems into formal logic programs, which are then solved by ATPs. The authors introduce a framework for categorizing errors in this translation process, including syntactic, shallow semantic, and deep semantic errors. They develop the SEDAC algorithm to automatically detect and correct these errors by comparing LLM-generated logic programs with high-confidence ATP outputs. The approach is tested on PRONTOQA steamroller problems, showing that it reduces semantic errors by 88-92% and improves accuracy by 15-30% compared to baseline LLM performance.

## Key Results
- Semantic errors are more common than syntactic errors in LLM translations
- The SEDAC algorithm reduces semantic errors by 88-92%
- Accuracy improves by 15-30% compared to baseline LLM performance
- Error categorization framework provides insights into LLM reasoning limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of LLMs with ATPs leverages the strengths of both systems: LLMs excel at understanding natural language and generating formal representations, while ATPs provide rigorous logical reasoning and verification. By identifying and correcting translation errors through the SEDAC algorithm, the approach bridges the gap between natural language understanding and formal logical reasoning. This combination allows for more accurate problem solving by reducing semantic errors that commonly occur in LLM translations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Automated Theorem Proving (ATP)**: Why needed: Provides rigorous logical reasoning and verification capabilities. Quick check: Can solve complex logical problems with high accuracy.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Why needed: Enables understanding and translation of natural language problems into formal logic. Quick check: Can accurately parse and interpret complex sentence structures.
- **Formal Logic Programming**: Why needed: Provides a structured representation for logical problems. Quick check: Can be translated into a format suitable for ATP processing.
- **Error Categorization**: Why needed: Helps identify and address different types of translation errors. Quick check: Can distinguish between syntactic, shallow semantic, and deep semantic errors.
- **Machine Learning**: Why needed: Powers the LLM's ability to understand and generate formal logic. Quick check: Can learn patterns from training data to improve translation accuracy.
- **Knowledge Representation**: Why needed: Enables structured representation of problem information. Quick check: Can accurately capture relationships between entities in the problem domain.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Natural Language Problem -> LLM Translation -> Formal Logic Program -> ATP Solving -> Error Detection/Correction -> Final Answer

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves translating the natural language problem into a formal logic program, solving it with an ATP, and then detecting and correcting any errors in the translation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by involving both LLMs and ATPs in the problem-solving process. This may increase processing time but provides more reliable results.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include incorrect translation of problem elements, failure to capture logical relationships, and errors in the formal logic program structure.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test the error categorization framework on a diverse set of reasoning problems
2. Evaluate the SEDAC algorithm's performance on problems with varying complexity
3. Compare the approach's accuracy with other methods for improving LLM reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation is conducted on a specific dataset (PRONTOQA steamroller problems) which may not generalize to broader reasoning tasks
- The SEDAC algorithm's effectiveness relies on having a high-confidence ATP output to compare against
- The generalizability of the approach to problems without clear ATP solutions or in domains where formal logic representation is more complex remains uncertain

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The error categorization framework appears well-grounded and the experimental results showing 88-92% reduction in semantic errors are robust within the tested domain
- Medium Confidence: The 15-30% accuracy improvement claim may not translate directly to other reasoning tasks or datasets due to the specific nature of the steamroller problems used
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of the SEDAC algorithm to problems without clear ATP solutions or in domains where formal logic representation is more complex remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on diverse reasoning datasets beyond PRONTOQA, including mathematical word problems and commonsense reasoning tasks, to evaluate cross-domain performance
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of error detection versus correction in the SEDAC algorithm, and test alternative error correction strategies
3. Implement a user study with domain experts to validate the practical utility and interpretability of the translated formal logic programs in real-world applications
