# An Integrated Framework for Multi-Granular Explanation of Video Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.10082
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10082
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Konstantinos Tsigos; Evlampios Apostolidis; Vasileios Mezaris
- Primary result: Framework produces fragment-level and object-level explanations for video summarization, identifying which video fragments and visual objects most influence summarization decisions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for explaining video summarization decisions through multi-granular explanations at both fragment and object levels. The framework combines perturbation-based methods (LIME) with video panoptic segmentation to identify which video fragments and specific visual objects most influence the summarizer's output. The authors evaluate their approach using a state-of-the-art summarization method (CA-SUM) on two standard datasets (SumMe and TVSum), demonstrating that the framework can effectively distinguish between influential and non-influential fragments and objects. The work addresses the critical need for transparency in video summarization systems by providing interpretable explanations of how these systems make content selection decisions.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a model-agnostic, perturbation-based approach to generate explanations for video summarization. For fragment-level explanations, the method applies LIME by masking entire video fragments and measuring changes in the summarizer's output scores. For object-level explanations, the framework combines video panoptic segmentation (using Video K-Net) with an adapted perturbation approach, masking individual objects across all frames within a fragment. The two explanation methods are integrated to provide comprehensive, multi-granular explanations. The framework is evaluated on SumMe and TVSum datasets using metrics including Discoverability+ (Disc+), Discoverability- (Disc-), Sanity Violation (SV), and Kendall's tau correlation coefficient.

## Key Results
- The framework successfully identifies both the most and least influential fragments and visual objects in video summarization decisions
- Object-level explanations demonstrate particular effectiveness at distinguishing between the most and least influential objects
- The perturbation-based approach reliably captures changes in summarizer output when fragments or objects are masked
- The framework provides complementary insights through both fragment-level and object-level explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LIME-based perturbation at the fragment level can reliably identify which video fragments most influenced the summarizer's output
- Mechanism: The framework masks out entire video fragments (replacing them with black frames) and measures the change in the summarizer's output scores. The fragments whose removal causes the largest score change are deemed most influential
- Core assumption: The summarizer's output changes monotonically with the removal of influential fragments, and the change can be captured by a linear regressor fitted to the perturbation results
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "investigating the use of a model-agnostic, perturbation-based approach for fragment-level explanation"
  - [section 3.1] "LIME [20] is a perturbation-based method that approximates the behavior of a model locally by generating a simpler, interpretable model"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the corpus doesn't discuss LIME adaptation for video fragments specifically
- Break condition: If the summarizer uses non-linear attention mechanisms that don't respond predictably to fragment masking, the linear approximation will fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Video panoptic segmentation enables precise object-level perturbation by tracking the same objects across frames within a fragment
- Mechanism: Video K-Net segments all frames in a fragment and assigns consistent object IDs. The framework then masks out all pixels belonging to a specific object across the entire fragment, measuring the summarizer's response to isolate the object's influence
- Core assumption: Object IDs remain consistent across frames within a fragment and that masking an object affects the summarizer uniformly across the fragment
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introducing a new method that combines the results of video panoptic segmentation with an adaptation of a perturbation-based explanation approach to produce object-level explanations"
  - [section 3.2] "To make sure that a perturbation is applied on the same visual object(s) across the frames of a video fragment, we spatially segment these frames using a model of the Video K-Net method for video panoptic segmentation"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; this appears to be novel to this work
- Break condition: If object tracking fails (e.g., due to occlusion or rapid motion), the perturbation won't be consistent across frames

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combined fragment-level and object-level explanations provide complementary insights that together explain both what parts of the video and which specific objects drove the summarizer's decisions
- Mechanism: Fragment-level explanations identify which temporal segments are important, while object-level explanations pinpoint which visual elements within those segments are most influential, creating a multi-granular explanation
- Core assumption: The fragment-level importance correlates with object-level importance, and the two levels of explanation reinforce rather than contradict each other
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This framework integrates methods for producing explanations both at the fragment level... and the more fine-grained visual object level"
  - [section 3] "integrate the methods for fragment- and object-level explanation into a framework for multi-granular explanation"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; the corpus mentions "multimodal explanation-guided learning" but doesn't discuss video summarization specifically
- Break condition: If fragment importance and object importance are uncorrelated, the multi-granular approach may provide redundant or conflicting information

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Video panoptic segmentation
  - Why needed here: Required for tracking and identifying individual objects across frames within a video fragment for object-level perturbation
  - Quick check question: How does Video K-Net handle object tracking across frames, and what happens when an object is partially occluded?

- Concept: Perturbation-based explanation methods (LIME)
  - Why needed here: Forms the core mechanism for both fragment and object-level explanations by systematically masking content and measuring model response
  - Quick check question: Why does LIME use a linear regressor to approximate the model's behavior, and what are the limitations of this approximation?

- Concept: Kendall's tau correlation coefficient
  - Why needed here: Used to measure the influence of perturbed fragments/objects on the summarizer's output by comparing original and perturbed importance scores
  - Quick check question: What properties of Kendall's tau make it suitable for measuring the ordinal relationship between original and perturbed summarizer outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input video → Shot segmentation → Sub-shot segmentation (if needed) → Summarizer → Fragment-level explanation (LIME or attention-based) → Object-level explanation (Video K-Net + LIME) → Multi-granular explanations
- Critical path: Video processing → Shot/sub-shot segmentation → Summarizer inference → Fragment-level explanation generation → Object-level explanation generation
- Design tradeoffs: Model-agnostic vs. model-specific approaches offer flexibility vs. performance; fragment-level vs. object-level explanations offer different granularities of insight
- Failure signatures: If explanations don't align with human intuition, check segmentation accuracy, perturbation implementation, or model response consistency
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the framework on a single, simple video with clear, distinct objects and verify fragment-level explanations align with obvious important segments
  2. Test object-level explanations by masking out one object at a time in a fragment and verifying the summarizer's response matches expectations
  3. Compare attention-based vs. LIME-based fragment-level explanations on the same video to understand the tradeoffs between model-specific and model-agnostic approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the framework change when using different state-of-the-art video summarization methods beyond CA-SUM?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention plans to test the framework with additional state-of-the-art methods as a future step
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation only uses CA-SUM, so the framework's generalizability to other summarization methods remains untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework with multiple state-of-the-art summarization methods and comparing performance metrics (Disc+/-, SV) across them

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the framework's explanations be made more user-friendly by incorporating textual descriptions of the visual-based explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose extending the framework to use advanced vision-language models like CLIP and BLIP-2 to provide textual descriptions of the visual explanations
- Why unresolved: The current framework only provides visual-based explanations, and the effectiveness of adding textual descriptions is unknown
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the proposed extension and conducting user studies to evaluate the impact of textual descriptions on user understanding and trust

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the object-level explanation method vary when using different video panoptic segmentation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use Video K-Net for video panoptic segmentation, but do not explore the impact of using alternative models
- Why unresolved: The performance of the object-level explanation method may be influenced by the quality and characteristics of the underlying segmentation model
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the object-level explanation method using different state-of-the-art video panoptic segmentation models and comparing the resulting explanations and performance metrics

## Limitations
- The model-agnostic approach may not capture complex non-linear relationships in the summarizer's decision-making process as effectively as model-specific methods
- Performance is evaluated on only two datasets (SumMe and TVSum), limiting generalizability to other video domains or summarization approaches
- Object-level explanations depend heavily on the accuracy of video panoptic segmentation, which can be challenging in scenes with occlusion, rapid motion, or complex object interactions

## Confidence
- Fragment-level explanations: Medium - perturbation-based approach is established but adaptation to video fragments introduces uncertainties
- Object-level explanations: Low-Medium - novel combination of panoptic segmentation with perturbation lacks validation on challenging tracking scenarios
- Multi-granular integration: Medium - theoretically sound but requires more empirical validation across diverse video content

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on videos with rapid camera motion and occlusion to evaluate the robustness of object-level explanations under challenging tracking conditions
2. Compare the model-agnostic LIME-based approach against model-specific attention-based explanations for the same summarization method to quantify the tradeoff between flexibility and explanation quality
3. Apply the framework to a third, distinctly different dataset (e.g., VTW or TVSum+) to assess generalizability beyond the original two datasets
