# Integrating Audio Narrations to Strengthen Domain Generalization in Multimodal First-Person Action Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.09611
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09611
- Authors: Cagri Gungor; Adriana Kovashka
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance on ARGO1M dataset, outperforming baseline by 4.8% and CIR by 1.2% mean accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses domain generalization challenges in first-person action recognition by integrating audio narrations with visual features. The authors propose a multimodal framework that leverages motion, audio, and appearance features, demonstrating that audio and motion modalities exhibit lower sensitivity to domain shifts compared to appearance features. By aligning audio features with audio-specific narrations and using consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations, the method optimizes audio influence during training, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ARGO1M dataset.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses separate encoders for appearance (SlowFast slow pathway), motion (SlowFast fast pathway), and audio (BEATs) features, along with text encoders for visual and audio narrations. Audio-specific narrations are generated using Pengi, and consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations are calculated offline using an LLM. These ratings serve as attention weights for audio embeddings during training. The framework employs contrastive learning losses to align visual features with narrations and audio features with audio narrations. Training combines cross-entropy loss with weighted alignment losses (λ=0.1) across all modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance on ARGO1M dataset with 4.8% improvement over baseline and 1.2% over previous best (CIR)
- Demonstrated lower domain shift sensitivity for motion (25.8% performance drop) and audio (32.7% drop) compared to appearance (54.8% drop)
- Showed that separate encoders for each modality outperform early fusion approaches in domain generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Audio and motion modalities exhibit lower sensitivity to domain shifts compared to appearance features in first-person action recognition.
- Mechanism: Temporal dynamics captured by audio (sound patterns) and motion (movement patterns) remain consistent across different environmental contexts, while appearance features are more affected by changes in objects, backgrounds, and visual contexts.
- Core assumption: The fundamental patterns of movement and sound associated with an action remain invariant across different domains, while the visual appearance of objects and environments varies significantly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our experimental analysis validate our intuition by showcasing lower performance drop of motion (25.8%) and audio (32.7%) comparing to appearance (54.8%) when applied to unseen domains."
  - [section] "This aligns with our hypothesis that temporal dynamics—such as consistent patterns of movement and continuity of sound—remain more stable across different environments and scenarios. In contrast, spatial semantics represented by appearance features, are more variable due to differences in objects, backgrounds, and other visual elements."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this is a novel finding from the paper.
- Break condition: If an action's temporal patterns (both motion and audio) change significantly across domains (e.g., cutting bamboo vs. cutting metal produces fundamentally different sounds and movements), or if the appearance features are less variable than expected.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aligning audio features with audio-specific narrations and using consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations optimizes the influence of audio in recognition.
- Mechanism: By generating audio-specific narrations and calculating consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations, the model can weigh audio contributions based on their semantic alignment with visual content, reducing the impact of irrelevant or noisy audio cues.
- Core assumption: The consistency between audio and visual narrations at a semantic level is a reliable indicator of the relevance of audio features to the visual action being performed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "applying consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations to optimize the impact of audio in recognition during training."
  - [section] "We use the following prompt obtain consistency ratings: Rate the consistency between two narrations from the same video out of 100. The first narration describes the visual aspect, and the second describes the audio."
  - [section] "This consistency-weighted audio approach ensures that audio information with strong semantic alignment to the visual content exerts a greater influence on the final prediction."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this is a novel approach proposed in the paper.
- Break condition: If the LLM-generated consistency ratings do not accurately reflect the true semantic alignment between audio and visual content, or if the audio-specific narrations generated by Pengi do not capture the essential audio features of the action.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using separate encoders for each modality (appearance, motion, audio) rather than early fusion improves domain generalization.
- Mechanism: Separate encoders allow each modality to learn domain-generalizable features independently, preserving the unique characteristics of each modality that contribute to robustness against domain shifts.
- Core assumption: Early fusion of modalities can lead to loss of modality-specific information that is crucial for handling domain shifts, while separate encoders can preserve and optimize these features independently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "our method differs by incorporating the audio modality and utilizing distinct encoders for each modality, instead of a single encoder for fused appearance and motion features."
  - [section] "we propose an alternative approach in the 'Ap, Mo' setting, where separate encoders (fappearance, fmotion) are employed to learn distinct domain-generalizable features, particularly because motion exhibits greater resistance to domain shifts."
  - [section] "As a result, our 'Ap, Mo' outperforms 'Ap-Mo'."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this is a design choice validated by the paper's ablation studies.
- Break condition: If the computational overhead of separate encoders outweighs the benefits, or if the separate encoders fail to learn complementary features and instead learn redundant or conflicting representations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Domain Generalization in Machine Learning
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the challenge of making models perform well on unseen domains, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning when dealing with real-world data that varies across different environments.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between domain adaptation and domain generalization, and why is the latter more challenging?

- Concept: Multimodal Learning and Fusion
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on integrating multiple modalities (appearance, motion, audio) to improve robustness, requiring understanding of how different data types can complement each other and how to effectively fuse them.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of early fusion versus late fusion in multimodal learning?

- Concept: Contrastive Learning for Representation Alignment
  - Why needed here: The paper uses contrastive learning to align visual features with narrations and audio features with audio narrations, which requires understanding how to create effective positive and negative pairs for representation learning.
  - Quick check question: How does noise contrastive estimation work in the context of aligning different modalities, and what makes a good negative sample?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Video clips with corresponding audio, visual narrations, and audio narrations
  Feature Extractors: Separate frozen encoders for appearance (SlowFast slow pathway), motion (SlowFast fast pathway), audio (BEATs), and text (CLIP-ViT-B-32)
  Trained Encoders: Three separate encoders (fappearance, fmotion, faudio) to derive domain-generalizable features from base features
  Text Encoder: Separate encoder (ftext) to extract features from visual and audio narrations
  Consistency Ratings: LLM-generated consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations
  Alignment Losses: Appearance-text alignment (Lap,t), motion-text alignment (Lm,t), and audio-text alignment (La,ˆt) using contrastive learning
  Classifier: Predicts action labels based on fused multimodal embeddings
  Losses: Cross-entropy loss (Lc) and weighted alignment loss (λLalign)

- Critical path:
  1. Extract base features from video and audio using frozen encoders
  2. Process base features through trained encoders to obtain domain-generalizable features
  3. Generate audio-specific narrations and calculate consistency ratings
  4. Apply consistency-weighted audio approach
  5. Perform text-guided alignment using contrastive learning
  6. Fuse features and predict action labels
  7. Compute losses and update trained encoders

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separate encoders vs. early fusion: Separate encoders preserve modality-specific information but increase computational complexity
  - Audio-specific narrations vs. visual narrations: Audio-specific narrations improve alignment but require additional generation step
  - Consistency weighting vs. uniform weighting: Consistency weighting optimizes audio influence but relies on LLM accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on specific domains despite good overall performance
  - High variance in performance across different domain splits
  - Degradation in performance when consistency weighting is applied
  - Ineffective alignment losses leading to poor feature representations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance of separate encoders vs. early fusion across all domain splits to validate the design choice
  2. Evaluate the impact of audio-specific narrations vs. visual narrations on audio-text alignment performance
  3. Test different weighting strategies for consistency ratings (e.g., linear scaling vs. exponential scaling) to optimize audio influence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different audio feature extraction methods (e.g., BEATs vs other pretrained models) impact domain generalization performance in multimodal first-person action recognition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using BEATs for audio feature extraction but does not explore alternative audio feature extraction methods or compare their impact on domain generalization performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of their multimodal framework with BEATs, but does not investigate how different audio feature extraction methods might influence the results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different audio feature extraction methods (e.g., OpenL3, VGGish) within the proposed framework, showing their impact on domain generalization performance across the ARGO1M dataset splits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on datasets with different domain shift characteristics (e.g., more severe or different types of domain shifts)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the method on the ARGO1M dataset, which has specific domain shift characteristics (scenario and location-based shifts). However, it does not explore how the method generalizes to datasets with different or more severe domain shift characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single dataset (ARGO1M) with specific domain shift characteristics, limiting the understanding of the method's generalizability to other scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on additional datasets with different domain shift characteristics (e.g., Epic-Kitchens, Something-Something) to evaluate the method's performance and robustness across diverse domain shift scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of LLM for consistency rating calculation affect the performance of the proposed method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using an LLM for calculating consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations, but does not explore how different LLMs might impact the results.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of LLM for consistency rating calculation, which could affect the quality of the consistency ratings and, consequently, the performance of the method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) for consistency rating calculation within the proposed framework, comparing their impact on domain generalization performance across the ARGO1M dataset splits.

## Limitations

- The core hypothesis about audio/motion feature resilience relies on a single dataset (ARGO1M) with specific domain shift characteristics
- The effectiveness of consistency-weighted audio optimization depends on the quality of LLM-generated consistency ratings, which may introduce biases
- The separate encoder architecture choice, while validated through ablation studies, may not generalize to all multimodal scenarios where early fusion could be beneficial

## Confidence

- High confidence in the mechanism of audio and motion features showing lower domain shift sensitivity (supported by direct experimental comparison with quantified performance drops: 25.8% for motion, 32.7% for audio vs 54.8% for appearance)
- Medium confidence in the consistency-weighted audio optimization approach (novel method without external validation, relies on LLM quality)
- Medium confidence in separate encoders improving domain generalization (validated through ablation but requires further testing on different architectures)

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on additional multimodal datasets with varying domain distributions to verify generalizability of audio/motion resilience findings
2. Evaluate the impact of different LLM models for consistency rating generation to assess robustness of the consistency-weighted approach
3. Compare separate encoder approach against early fusion methods on tasks where appearance features are more domain-stable to identify boundary conditions for architecture choice
