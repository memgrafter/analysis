# OLMES: A Standard for Language Model Evaluations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.08446
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08446
- Reference count: 35
- One-line primary result: OLMES provides a reproducible, well-documented, and practical standard for evaluating language models across 10 benchmarks and 15 base models

## Executive Summary
OLMES addresses the critical need for standardized language model evaluation by providing clear, reproducible guidelines for prompt formatting, in-context examples, probability normalization, and task formulation. The framework specifically tackles the challenge of comparing base models of different sizes by supporting both cloze and multiple-choice formulations, allowing smaller models to be evaluated using cloze formulation while larger models can utilize multiple-choice. Validated across 15 diverse base models and 10 benchmarks, OLMES balances evaluation accuracy with computational efficiency through practical choices like 5-shot examples and sampling 1000 instances from large datasets.

## Method Summary
OLMES standardizes language model evaluation through a systematic pipeline that transforms multiple-choice question answering datasets into prompts suitable for base models. The method involves formatting dataset instances with curated 5-shot examples, evaluating models using both cloze formulation (CF) and multiple-choice formulation (MCF), applying appropriate probability normalization schemes (token, character, PMI, or none), and selecting the better score between CF and MCF evaluations. The framework is implemented in Python with open-source code and validated on 15 base language models across 10 benchmark datasets, providing justified recommendations for each evaluation decision to ensure reproducibility and comparability.

## Key Results
- OLMES successfully standardizes evaluation across 15 base models (ranging from 1B to 70B parameters) on 10 diverse benchmarks
- The dual CF/MCF formulation approach enables meaningful comparisons between smaller base models requiring cloze formulation and larger models capable of multiple-choice
- Practical design choices (5-shot examples, 1000 instance samples) maintain evaluation quality while ensuring computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: OLMES ensures reproducible LLM evaluations by standardizing prompt formatting, in-context examples, probability normalization, and task formulation.
- Mechanism: The standard provides explicit, documented recommendations for each evaluation step, eliminating ambiguity in how tasks are presented to models and how outputs are interpreted.
- Core assumption: Different evaluation setups significantly impact measured performance, making direct model comparisons unreliable without standardization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "OLMES offers clear guidelines on prompt formatting, choice of in-context examples, probability normalization, and task formulation, ensuring that results are comparable across studies."
  - [section] "OLMES provides justified recommendations on decisions such as how to format dataset instances, the choice of in-context examples, task formulation, probability normalization, as well as other implementation details."
- Break condition: If a model requires non-standard evaluation formats that cannot be accommodated within OLMES guidelines.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: OLMES enables meaningful comparisons between base models of varying sizes by supporting both cloze (CF) and multiple-choice (MCF) formulations.
- Mechanism: The standard evaluates each model using both MCF and CF formulations and uses the better result, allowing weaker models to be assessed using CF while stronger models can utilize MCF for more accurate assessment.
- Core assumption: Base models acquire the ability to understand MCF format during training, while CF remains a better signal for weaker models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In particular, OLMES supports meaningful comparisons between smaller base models that require the unnatural 'cloze' formulation of multiple-choice questions against larger models that can utilize the original formulation."
  - [section] "We can see an explicit example of a model acquiring the 'understanding' of MCF during training in Figure 1, showing the OLMo-7B-0424 model evaluated on the MMLU validation set in both CF and MCF variations."
- Break condition: If the gap between CF and MCF performance becomes negligible across all model sizes, making the dual-formulation approach unnecessary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: OLMES provides practical evaluation recommendations that balance accuracy with computational efficiency.
- Mechanism: The standard uses curated 5-shot examples, samples 1000 instances from large datasets, and selects normalization schemes based on empirical analysis to reduce computational overhead while maintaining evaluation quality.
- Core assumption: Computational efficiency is crucial for adoption, and the marginal gains from larger shot counts or full dataset evaluation don't justify the increased resource requirements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "OLMES is: Practical: OLMES makes practical decisions in use of computation resources for easy adoption by the community."
  - [section] "Restricting to 5 in-context examples helps limit computational overhead, similar to HELM (Liang et al., 2023). Analysis suggests that going beyond 5 shots generally does not provide meaningful differences in scores."
- Break condition: If future models show significant performance improvements with shot counts greater than 5 or require full dataset evaluation for reliable assessment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) evaluation
  - Why needed here: OLMES focuses specifically on standardizing MCQA evaluations, which are commonly used for base LLM assessment
  - Quick check question: What are the two main formulations for presenting multiple-choice questions to LLMs in OLMES?

- Concept: Probability normalization for language model outputs
  - Why needed here: OLMES standardizes different normalization approaches (none, token, character, pmi) for cloze formulation evaluations
  - Quick check question: Which normalization method does OLMES use for ARC-Challenge and why?

- Concept: In-context learning and few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: OLMES standardizes the use of curated 5-shot examples for task presentation to LLMs
  - Quick check question: Why does OLMES restrict to 5 in-context examples rather than using more shots?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset → Instance formatting → Few-shot example addition → Model evaluation → Output normalization → Score calculation
- Critical path: Dataset → Instance formatting → Few-shot example addition → Model evaluation → Output normalization → Score calculation
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing evaluation accuracy with computational efficiency (e.g., 5-shot vs more examples, 1000 instance sample vs full dataset)
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent scores across different evaluation setups, model performance that doesn't align with expectations, computational resource constraints during evaluation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a small base model on ARC-Challenge using both CF and MCF formulations to observe the performance gap
  2. Test different normalization schemes on a sample dataset to verify OLMES recommendations
  3. Run the same evaluation with different random seeds for few-shot examples to check score stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the recommendations in OLMES generalize to multi-modal language models (e.g., models that handle both text and images)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that future work includes applying the principles of OLMES to multi-modal models, but does not provide specific recommendations for such tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on language models and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Extending the evaluation standard to multi-modal models would require new considerations for how to present tasks, normalize probabilities, and score responses when dealing with both text and images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing OLMES prompts and normalization techniques for multi-modal tasks, and evaluating the performance of various multi-modal models using these standardized methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of prompt formatting and few-shot examples affect the robustness of language models to adversarial attacks or biased data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that larger differences would be expected when diverging from OLMES recommendations, such as using unnatural prompts or randomly sampled few-shot examples. However, it does not explicitly study the impact of these choices on model robustness.
- Why unresolved: Evaluating model robustness to adversarial attacks and biased data is a complex task that requires careful consideration of prompt design, data selection, and evaluation metrics. The paper does not provide a framework for assessing these aspects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to measure the performance of language models on adversarial datasets and biased data, using different prompt formats and few-shot examples. Analyzing the results to identify patterns and develop strategies for improving model robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the recommendations in OLMES perform when applied to tasks beyond multiple-choice question answering, such as generative tasks or chain-of-thought prompting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that future work includes adding more tasks to OLMES, covering tasks beyond MCQA such as generative tasks and chain-of-thought prompting. It also mentions that the fundamental principles of OLMES generalize to any dataset of interest.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on multiple-choice question answering tasks and does not provide specific recommendations for other task types. Extending OLMES to these tasks would require new considerations for prompt design, normalization techniques, and evaluation metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing OLMES prompts and normalization techniques for generative tasks and chain-of-thought prompting. Evaluating the performance of language models on these tasks using the standardized methods, and comparing the results to existing evaluation practices.

## Limitations
- Validation restricted to 15 base models across 10 benchmarks, potentially missing edge cases or special requirements of all model architectures
- Heavy reliance on empirical observations rather than theoretical guarantees for evaluation choices like 5-shot examples
- Normalization scheme recommendations may not generalize optimally across all tokenizers or language pairs
- Assumes base models are suitable for evaluation tasks, limiting applicability to more specialized or instruction-tuned models

## Confidence

**High Confidence** - Mechanism 1 (Reproducibility through standardization): The claim that standardized evaluation procedures improve reproducibility is well-supported by the documented implementation details and the explicit focus on eliminating ambiguity in evaluation setup. The methodology is transparent and the implementation is publicly available.

**Medium Confidence** - Mechanism 2 (Dual formulation for model comparison): While the empirical evidence shows performance differences between CF and MCF formulations across model sizes, the claim that this approach "enables meaningful comparisons" is somewhat speculative. The paper doesn't provide extensive analysis of when this dual approach is most beneficial or whether it could introduce its own inconsistencies.

**Medium Confidence** - Mechanism 3 (Computational efficiency): The tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency is reasonable, but the specific choices (5-shot, 1000 samples) are presented as optimal without extensive sensitivity analysis. The framework's efficiency gains are likely real but may come with unquantified accuracy costs for certain use cases.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architectural validation**: Test OLMES on at least 5 additional base models from different architectural families (e.g., transformer variants, state-space models) to verify that the standardization doesn't introduce systematic biases for certain architectures.

2. **Shot-count sensitivity analysis**: Systematically evaluate the same models across the same benchmarks using 1, 3, 5, and 10-shot variations to empirically verify the claim that 5 shots provide an optimal balance between computational efficiency and evaluation accuracy.

3. **Tokenization boundary case testing**: Create controlled test cases with answers that have ambiguous tokenization boundaries (e.g., answers that could be split differently by different tokenizers) to verify that the character normalization scheme handles all edge cases correctly across different model tokenizers.
