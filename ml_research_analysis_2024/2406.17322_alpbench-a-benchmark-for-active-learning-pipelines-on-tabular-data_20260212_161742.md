# ALPBench: A Benchmark for Active Learning Pipelines on Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17322
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First standardized benchmark for active learning pipelines combining query strategies with learning algorithms on tabular data

## Executive Summary
ALPBench introduces the first standardized benchmark for active learning pipelines on tabular data, addressing the reproducibility crisis in AL research. The benchmark implements 86 datasets, 5 active learning settings, and supports 23 query strategies paired with 23 learning algorithms through a modular Python package. Experimental results show that pipeline performance heavily depends on the learning algorithm choice, with Random Forest, CatBoost, and TabPFN achieving the strongest results. Information-based query strategies work best in most cases, though representation-based approaches excel in small-label settings. The study also finds that active learning can sometimes decrease performance, and that the effectiveness of query strategies varies significantly with the learning algorithm used.

## Method Summary
ALPBench provides a modular Python package for benchmarking active learning pipelines that combine query strategies with learning algorithms on tabular data. The benchmark implements 86 real-world datasets from OpenML-CC18 and TabZilla, covering 48 binary and 38 multi-class classification tasks. It supports 5 predefined active learning settings (small/large, static/dynamic) and allows pairing 23 query strategies with 23 learning algorithms. The benchmark ensures reproducibility by storing exact dataset splits and hyperparameter settings, and uses a 180-second time limit per experiment with 24-hour maximum runtime. Performance is evaluated using test accuracy and area under the budget curve (AUBC), with statistical significance assessed using Welch's t-test at p=0.05.

## Key Results
- Pipeline performance is dominated by learning algorithm choice, with Random Forest, CatBoost, and TabPFN achieving the strongest results
- Information-based query strategies are generally most effective, though representation-based approaches excel in small-label settings
- Active learning can sometimes decrease performance, particularly when learning algorithms and query strategies are mismatched
- The effectiveness of query strategies varies significantly depending on the learning algorithm used

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark achieves reproducibility by saving exact dataset splits and hyperparameter settings of used algorithms.
- Mechanism: By storing the indices of data points that are labeled initially and used for testing, along with the hyperparameter settings of learners and query strategies, ALPBench ensures that experiments can be exactly replicated. This prevents discrepancies that arise from random data splits or varying algorithm configurations.
- Core assumption: That dataset splits and hyperparameter settings are the primary sources of irreproducibility in active learning experiments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The benchmark connector stores meta-information relevant for reproducibility. This includes storing the indices of data points that are labeled initially and used for testing."
  - [section]: "Furthermore, the settings of hyperparameters of learners and query strategies are stored so that the same configurations can be maintained for future studies."
- Break condition: If the saved settings do not capture all sources of randomness in the learning process (e.g., random weight initialization in neural networks) or if the environment changes (different library versions).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The effectiveness of query strategies heavily depends on the choice of learning algorithm.
- Mechanism: Different learning algorithms have varying inductive biases and representations of the data. A query strategy that exploits uncertainty based on one model's predictions may not align with the strengths of another model. Therefore, combining different query strategies with different learning algorithms reveals which combinations are most effective.
- Core assumption: That the performance of a query strategy is not intrinsic to the strategy itself but is mediated by the learning algorithm's behavior and data representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The choice of the learning algorithm is quite important for the overall success of AL [17]."
  - [section]: "While the learning algorithm turns out to be the most crucial choice, the suitability of query strategies also varies for different datasets."
- Break condition: If the learning algorithms used do not adequately represent the diversity of inductive biases in the field, or if the evaluation metric does not capture the nuances of different algorithm-strategy combinations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Active learning can sometimes decrease performance, especially when the learning algorithm and query strategy are mismatched.
- Mechanism: If a query strategy selects data points that are not informative for the chosen learning algorithm, or if the algorithm cannot effectively learn from the selected points, the model's performance may degrade. This is particularly evident when using complex models with limited data or when diversity-based strategies are used with algorithms that require more labeled data to learn the data distribution.
- Core assumption: That the interaction between the query strategy and learning algorithm is not always synergistic and can lead to suboptimal data selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We find that it is more important to choose a strong learner than selecting a suitable QS and that repr. and hybr. QSs are better suited for multi-class than for binary datasets."
  - [section]: "To conclude,AL can deteriorate performance, as has also been shown in [ 23, 29]."
- Break condition: If the evaluation is limited to a narrow set of datasets or if the performance metric is not sensitive enough to detect decreases in performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Active Learning Problem Definition
  - Why needed here: Understanding the formal problem definition is crucial for implementing and evaluating active learning pipelines correctly. It defines the roles of the labeled pool, unlabeled pool, oracle, and query strategy.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of the pool-based active learning scenario, and what is the role of each?

- Concept: Query Strategy Classification
  - Why needed here: Knowing the different types of query strategies (information-based, representation-based, hybrid) is essential for understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases.
  - Quick check question: How do information-based query strategies differ from representation-based query strategies in terms of the data they leverage?

- Concept: Learning Algorithm Selection
  - Why needed here: The choice of learning algorithm significantly impacts the performance of an active learning pipeline. Understanding the bias-variance spectrum and the strengths of different algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, gradient boosting) is crucial for effective benchmarking.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to include a diverse set of learning algorithms (e.g., base learners, GBDTs, DNNs, PFNs) in an active learning benchmark?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Manager -> Benchmark Connector -> Experimenter -> Active Learning Pipeline (Learner + Query Strategy)
- Critical path: 1) Specify active learning problem (setting and scenario) -> 2) Specify active learning pipeline (learner and query strategy) -> 3) Run experiment using Experimenter -> 4) Analyze results using logging and evaluation tools
- Design tradeoffs: The modular design allows for easy extension with new learners and query strategies but may introduce overhead in managing dependencies. The focus on reproducibility ensures reliable comparisons but may limit flexibility in exploring random variations.
- Failure signatures: 1) Learners exceeding the time limit, leading to incomplete experiments, 2) Query strategies failing due to incompatibility with the learner or data, 3) Memory issues when handling large datasets, 4) Statistical insignificance preventing meaningful comparisons.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a simple experiment with a single dataset, learner (e.g., Random Forest), and query strategy (e.g., Margin Sampling) to verify the basic functionality.
  2. Compare the performance of two different learners (e.g., Random Forest and SVM) with the same query strategy (e.g., Entropy Sampling) to observe the impact of the learning algorithm.
  3. Compare the performance of two different query strategies (e.g., Margin Sampling and CoreSet) with the same learner (e.g., Random Forest) to observe the impact of the query strategy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does active learning performance vary across different dataset characteristics beyond size and class balance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that performance depends on the learning algorithm, dataset, and setting, but doesn't deeply analyze dataset characteristics
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on 86 datasets but doesn't systematically categorize or analyze performance variations based on dataset properties like feature correlation, noise levels, or class separability
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of ALP performance stratified by dataset characteristics, showing which properties make certain query strategies or learners more effective

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for switching between query strategies during active learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "it might be a good idea to first focus more on diversity and later on uncertainty" but don't explore this
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate dynamic switching strategies or adaptive mechanisms for query strategy selection during the AL process
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing fixed vs. adaptive query strategy selection, showing when and how to switch strategies for optimal performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does limited training time affect the validity of conclusions about deep learning methods in active learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge "this of course may decrease the performance of deep learning algorithms, such as TabNet, and poses a limitation to the generalizability of our empirical study"
- Why unresolved: The 180-second training time constraint may have prevented deep learning methods from reaching their full potential, particularly in larger settings
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with longer training times or unlimited training time for deep learning methods, comparing performance to other learners

## Limitations
- The benchmark's focus on tabular data limits generalizability to other data types like text or images
- The study uses default hyperparameters for most learners, potentially missing optimization opportunities
- The 180-second training time constraint may have prevented deep learning methods from reaching their full potential

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The reproducibility mechanism works as claimed, based on the clear description of stored indices and hyperparameter settings.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that learning algorithm choice dominates query strategy effectiveness, as this is supported by experimental results but may vary across different dataset distributions.
- **Medium confidence**: The observation that active learning can decrease performance, which is theoretically plausible but may depend on specific implementation details and evaluation metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Test ALPBench on a synthetic dataset with known properties to verify that query strategies behave as theoretically expected across different learning algorithms.
2. Run a subset of experiments with multiple random seeds to quantify the variance introduced by different data splits and assess the robustness of reported performance differences.
3. Implement and evaluate a simple neural network learner (e.g., MLP with default PyTorch parameters) to extend the benchmark's coverage of deep learning approaches and validate the claim that base learners struggle with large label budgets.
