# Self-optimization in distributed manufacturing systems using Modular State-based Stackelberg Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22912
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22912
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces Mod-SbSG, achieving up to 97.1% reduction in system overflow and 5-13% decrease in power consumption in laboratory-scale manufacturing testbeds.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Modular State-based Stackelberg Games (Mod-SbSG), a novel game-theoretic framework for self-optimization in distributed manufacturing systems. By combining State-based Potential Games with Stackelberg game theory, Mod-SbSG creates a hierarchical structure where critical actuators (leaders) make initial decisions and less critical ones (followers) respond optimally. The approach was validated on two laboratory-scale testbeds, demonstrating significant improvements over vanilla SbPG in reducing overflow, power consumption, and improving global objective values.

## Method Summary
The method introduces Mod-SbSG by integrating State-based Potential Games (SbPG) with Stackelberg game theory to create a hierarchical decision-making structure. Critical actuators are assigned as leaders who make initial decisions, followed by followers who respond optimally to these decisions. The framework uses performance maps for policy representation and applies gradient-based learning for both SbPG and Stackelberg updates. The approach was tested with both globally interpolated gradient-based learning and Advantage Actor-Critic algorithms on Bulk Good Laboratory Plant and Larger-Scale Bulk Good Laboratory Plant testbeds featuring sequential and serial-parallel processes.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 97.1% reduction in system overflow compared to baseline SbPG
- Decreased power consumption by 5-13% while maintaining production demand satisfaction
- Demonstrated consistent performance improvements across different learning methods (gradient-based and A2C) and industrial configurations (sequential and serial-parallel processes)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical decision-making enables better coordination than simultaneous decision-making in distributed manufacturing systems.
- Mechanism: By assigning critical actuators as leaders who make initial decisions, followed by followers who respond optimally to those decisions, the system creates a coordinated response pattern that reduces conflicts and improves overall performance metrics like overflow reduction and power consumption.
- Core assumption: The critical actuators can be accurately identified and assigned as leaders, and their decisions significantly influence system outcomes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This hierarchical structure assigns more important modules of the manufacturing system a first-mover advantage, while less important modules respond optimally to the leaders' decisions."
  - [section]: "This decision-making process differs from typical multi-agent learning algorithms in manufacturing systems, where decisions are made simultaneously."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only 2 citations across 25 related papers, suggesting limited prior work in this specific approach
- Break condition: If critical actuators cannot be accurately identified, or if the system dynamics change rapidly such that leader decisions become outdated before followers respond.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Integrating Stackelberg games with State-based Potential Games (SbPG) creates a convergent game structure that improves self-optimization.
- Mechanism: The SbPG component handles the coordination within leader and follower groups separately, while the Stackelberg component manages the hierarchical interaction between these groups. This creates a two-level optimization where local optimization within groups is followed by global optimization between groups.
- Core assumption: The convergence properties of both SbPG and Stackelberg games can be combined without interference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This hierarchical structure assigns more important modules of the manufacturing system a first-mover advantage, while less important modules respond optimally to the leaders' decisions."
  - [section]: "We provide convergence guarantees for the novel game structure resulting in guidelines for the learning algorithms."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly address this specific combination of SbPG and Stackelberg games
- Break condition: If the Stackelberg equilibrium calculation becomes computationally prohibitive, or if the SbPG convergence assumptions are violated in practice.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Performance maps with stacked follower strategies enable effective gradient-based learning in the hierarchical structure.
- Mechanism: Leaders maintain traditional performance maps based on their local state information, while followers use stacked performance maps that incorporate both their local state and the coalition actions of leaders. This allows followers to optimize their responses based on anticipated leader actions.
- Core assumption: The stacked performance map approach provides sufficient coverage of the state-action space for effective interpolation and gradient calculation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "When a follower interpolates its map, it references a specific layer corresponding to the selected leader's actions, rather than interpolating through a much larger, high-dimensional map."
  - [section]: "This method simplifies the process and reduces computational complexity."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only indirect support from general performance map literature
- Break condition: If the stacked performance map becomes too sparse for effective interpolation, or if the leader-follower coupling creates oscillations in the learning process.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: State-based Potential Games (SbPG)
  - Why needed here: SbPG provides the theoretical foundation for ensuring convergence in distributed multi-agent systems while allowing state-dependent utility functions.
  - Quick check question: How does SbPG differ from standard potential games in terms of state dependence?

- Concept: Stackelberg equilibrium
  - Why needed here: Stackelberg equilibrium provides the solution concept for hierarchical decision-making where leaders anticipate and optimize against follower responses.
  - Quick check question: What conditions must hold for a Stackelberg equilibrium to exist in this manufacturing context?

- Concept: Gradient-based learning in game-theoretic settings
  - Why needed here: Gradient-based methods provide the update mechanism for both the SbPG and Stackelberg components while maintaining convergence properties.
  - Quick check question: How does the gradient update differ between simultaneous games and Stackelberg games?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Leader agents -> Maintain performance maps, execute gradient updates based on Stackelberg rules
  - Follower agents -> Maintain stacked performance maps, execute multi-step optimization responding to leaders
  - Game coordinator -> Manages the alternating update sequence between SbPG within groups and Stackelberg between groups
  - Environment simulator -> Provides state transitions and utility feedback
  - Polynomial regression module -> Approximates potential functions for gradient calculation

- Critical path:
  1. Leaders update their strategies via SbPG gradient updates
  2. Followers observe leader actions and perform multi-step optimization via SbPG
  3. Stackelberg game computes coalition strategies based on leader-follower interaction
  4. Environment provides feedback for next iteration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Leader selection: More leaders provide better global optimization but increase computational complexity
  - Update frequency: More follower update steps improve response quality but increase training time
  - Performance map resolution: Higher resolution improves accuracy but increases memory requirements

- Failure signatures:
  - Oscillation in leader-follower strategies indicating unstable Stackelberg equilibrium
  - Poor convergence in follower SbPG suggesting inadequate stacked performance map coverage
  - Increasing power consumption despite optimization attempts indicating incorrect utility function design

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement SbPG with gradient-based learning on a single actuator to validate basic performance map functionality
  2. Add a second actuator as leader and validate Stackelberg coordination on a two-agent system
  3. Scale to full BGLP configuration with multiple leaders and followers to validate hierarchical coordination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of leaders in Mod-SbSG for different manufacturing configurations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests Mod-SbSG with 1 to 3 leaders in the BGLP and with 4 leaders in the LS-BGLP sequential process, showing varying performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited range of leader configurations and does not explore the relationship between system complexity, leader count, and performance optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying leader counts across different system complexities and configurations, with performance metrics to identify optimal leader-to-follower ratios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does Mod-SbSG perform in manufacturing systems with non-linear state transitions or continuous action spaces?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on discrete action spaces and assumes state transitions that align with the potential function properties, but does not explicitly test non-linear or continuous dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical framework and experiments are limited to specific types of state-action relationships that satisfy the potential function requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing Mod-SbSG in environments with non-linear state transitions, continuous action spaces, and non-convex potential functions to evaluate convergence and performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can Mod-SbSG be effectively extended to handle multi-objective optimization beyond the current two-objective framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a weighted combination of two objectives (fill levels and power consumption) with fixed weights for all players.
- Why unresolved: The current framework does not explore dynamic weight adjustments, additional objectives, or methods for handling conflicting objectives across different players.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating additional objectives (e.g., production quality, maintenance scheduling) with dynamic weighting schemes and analysis of trade-offs in multi-objective settings.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes accurate identification of critical actuators as leaders, which may not scale well to complex, dynamic manufacturing environments where actuator importance varies over time.
- Computational complexity of Stackelberg equilibrium calculations may become prohibitive in larger systems with many leaders and followers.
- The approach relies on effective interpolation in performance maps, which may fail if the state-action space becomes too sparse or high-dimensional.

## Confidence

- Hierarchical coordination benefits: Medium to High
- Theoretical foundations combining SbPG and Stackelberg: Medium
- Performance map approach effectiveness: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Testing**: Implement Mod-SbSG on a larger-scale manufacturing system with 10+ actuators to validate whether the computational complexity of Stackelberg equilibrium calculations remains tractable and whether performance benefits persist at scale.

2. **Dynamic Leader Assignment**: Develop and test an adaptive leader-follower assignment mechanism that can dynamically reassign roles based on changing system conditions, addressing the limitation of static critical actuator identification.

3. **Robustness to Sensor Noise**: Introduce realistic sensor noise and measurement delays into the BGLP testbed to evaluate how Mod-SbSG performance degrades compared to baseline methods under real-world operating conditions.
