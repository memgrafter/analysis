# Low-Dimensional Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding via Knowledge Distillation
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.05748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05748
- Reference count: 40
- Reduces embedding dimensions by half while maintaining 99% MRR of full-dimensional models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FedKD, a lightweight component designed to compress high-dimensional federated knowledge graph embeddings into lower dimensions without significant performance loss. The approach leverages knowledge distillation to enable low-dimensional student models to mimic the score distribution of high-dimensional teacher models, using KL divergence loss with adaptive asymmetric temperature scaling. This mechanism mitigates teacher over-confidence issues by learning distinct temperatures for positive and negative samples. FedKD also dynamically adjusts the weight of the KD loss during training to balance hard and soft label optimization.

## Method Summary
FedKD employs knowledge distillation where high-dimensional teacher models serve as the knowledge source and low-dimensional student models learn to replicate their score distributions. The key innovation is an asymmetric temperature scaling mechanism that uses separate temperature parameters for positive and negative samples during KL divergence computation. This addresses the common knowledge distillation issue where teacher models become overly confident, particularly on negative samples. The method also incorporates a dynamic weighting scheme for the KD loss that evolves throughout training, allowing the student to initially focus on hard label learning before gradually shifting to soft label optimization. The approach is designed specifically for federated learning scenarios where computational and communication resources are constrained.

## Key Results
- Reduces embedding dimensions by 50% while maintaining nearly equivalent performance
- Achieves MRR scores within 99% of teacher models across various KGE methods
- Demonstrates effectiveness across three different knowledge graph datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The asymmetric temperature scaling addresses a fundamental limitation in standard knowledge distillation where overconfident teacher predictions can mislead student models, especially on negative samples. By learning separate temperatures for positive and negative samples, FedKD allows the student model to more accurately capture the teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. The dynamic KD loss weighting enables a curriculum-like learning process where the student first learns from ground truth labels before refining its understanding through soft label distillation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Distillation (KD)**: Transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model through soft label supervision. Why needed: Enables model compression without significant performance degradation. Quick check: Compare student performance with and without KD on a small dataset.
- **KL Divergence Loss**: Measures the difference between two probability distributions, used here to align student and teacher score distributions. Why needed: Provides smooth gradient signals for distribution matching. Quick check: Verify KL loss decreases during training on a synthetic distribution pair.
- **Temperature Scaling**: Modifies softmax outputs to produce softer probability distributions, with higher temperatures creating more uniform distributions. Why needed: Controls the smoothness of probability distributions for KD. Quick check: Observe how temperature affects probability distribution shape.
- **Federated Learning Constraints**: Distributed training across multiple clients with communication and computational limitations. Why needed: Justifies the need for model compression in federated settings. Quick check: Measure communication costs for full vs. compressed models.
- **Asymmetric Temperature Scaling**: Using different temperatures for positive and negative samples during KD. Why needed: Addresses teacher overconfidence on negative samples. Quick check: Compare performance with symmetric vs. asymmetric temperature scaling.
- **Dynamic Loss Weighting**: Adjusting the importance of KD loss relative to other losses during training. Why needed: Enables curriculum learning from hard to soft labels. Quick check: Track loss weight progression during training.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: High-dimensional teacher models -> FedKD component -> Low-dimensional student models
**Critical Path**: Teacher inference → Score distribution extraction → KL divergence computation with asymmetric temperatures → Student model update
**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Model compression vs. performance preservation (50% dimension reduction with 99% MRR retention)
- Communication efficiency vs. model accuracy in federated settings
- Temperature asymmetry vs. implementation complexity

**Failure Signatures**:
- Student performance degradation when teacher model is too confident on negative samples
- Convergence issues when KD loss weight is not properly scheduled
- Suboptimal performance on highly sparse knowledge graphs

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate asymmetric temperature scaling by comparing with symmetric baseline on a simple dataset
2. Test dynamic KD loss weighting by comparing with fixed weight schedule
3. Measure communication cost reduction in federated setting with different client participation rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited quantitative analysis of computational efficiency gains in federated settings
- Evaluation restricted to three datasets without testing on more diverse knowledge graphs
- No exploration of simpler alternatives to asymmetric temperature scaling

## Confidence
- **High**: Core knowledge distillation methodology and KL divergence loss implementation
- **Medium**: Claimed performance preservation (99% MRR) across different KGE methods
- **Low**: Practical federated learning benefits and resource savings

## Next Checks
1. Conduct head-to-head comparison of communication costs and training time between FedKD and full-dimensional baselines across different network conditions and client participation rates.
2. Test the adaptive temperature mechanism on knowledge graphs with different characteristics (e.g., varying entity/relation ratios, different levels of sparsity) to assess generalizability.
3. Perform ablation studies removing the dynamic KD loss weight adjustment to quantify its individual contribution to the overall performance.
