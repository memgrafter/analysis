# Embedding Cultural Diversity in Prototype-based Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.14329
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14329
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Reduces popularity bias in recommender systems by 27% for long-tail items and improves HitRatio@10 by 2%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses popularity bias in recommender systems that favor dominant cultural norms while marginalizing underrepresented groups. The authors propose enhancing prototype-based matrix factorization (ProtoMF) methods with two innovations: Prototype K-filtering, which improves representation by selecting the k nearest prototypes, and Prototype-Distributing Regularizer, which enforces uniform distribution of prototypes to ensure diverse cultural representation. Using country of origin as a proxy for cultural identity, the approach demonstrates significant improvements in fairness metrics without compromising recommendation quality, achieving a 2% improvement in HitRatio@10 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The method builds on prototype-based matrix factorization by introducing two key innovations to address popularity bias. Prototype K-filtering refines user and item representations by selecting only the k nearest prototypes, reducing the influence of distant, potentially dominant prototypes. The Prototype-Distributing Regularizer applies a regularization term that encourages uniform prototype distribution across the embedding space, preventing clustering and ensuring better representation of diverse cultural groups. The framework is evaluated on four datasets using country of origin as a proxy for cultural identity, measuring both recommendation performance and fairness metrics including long-tail item ranking and representation of underrepresented countries.

## Key Results
- Achieves 27% reduction in average rank of long-tail items
- Reduces average rank of items from underrepresented countries by 2%
- Improves HitRatio@10 by 2% compared to state-of-the-art
- Demonstrates that fairness improvements can be achieved without sacrificing recommendation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Prototype K-filtering reduces popularity bias by limiting influence of distant prototypes. By selecting only the k nearest prototypes for each user and item, the model reduces the impact of distant, potentially dominant prototypes that may be overrepresenting popular items. This localizes the representation, allowing less popular items to be better represented by more relevant prototypes.

### Mechanism 2
Prototype-Distributing Regularizer promotes diverse cultural representation by enforcing uniform prototype distribution. The regularization term encourages prototypes to be approximately orthogonal, preventing them from clustering in specific regions of the embedding space. This ensures that underrepresented users and items are associated with more appropriate prototypes rather than distant ones dominated by popular items.

### Mechanism 3
Focusing on item country of origin as sensitive attribute effectively addresses allocational harms. By incorporating the country of origin of item providers as a cultural feature, the model can directly mitigate allocational harms affecting underrepresented cultures. This approach allows the system to identify and challenge biases toward dominant cultural groups.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Matrix Factorization (MF)
  - Why needed here: Prototype-based matrix factorization extends traditional MF by introducing prototypes to create more interpretable embeddings
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between traditional MF and prototype-based MF?

- Concept: Cosine Similarity and Shifted Cosine Similarity
  - Why needed here: The model uses shifted cosine similarity to compute similarities between users/items and prototypes, which is crucial for the prototype filtering and regularization mechanisms
  - Quick check question: How does shifted cosine similarity differ from regular cosine similarity, and why might it be preferred in this context?

- Concept: Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding how popularity bias manifests in recommender systems is essential to appreciate why the proposed mechanisms work
  - Quick check question: What are the two main types of harm caused by popularity bias, as discussed in the paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User-item interaction data with country metadata -> ProtoMF core with Prototype K-filtering -> Prototype-Distributing Regularizer -> Recommendation scores with reduced cultural bias

- Critical path: 1. Data preprocessing with country of origin metadata, 2. ProtoMF initialization and training, 3. Prototype K-filtering application, 4. Prototype-Distributing Regularizer application, 5. Recommendation generation and evaluation

- Design tradeoffs: K value selection (small k improves local representation but may lose information; large k may reintroduce popularity bias), Regularization strength (too weak has minimal effect; too strong causes performance degradation), Country of origin as proxy (simplifies implementation but may not capture full cultural complexity)

- Failure signatures: HitRatio@10 decreases significantly without corresponding improvement in fairness metrics, Long-tail item ranking doesn't improve despite regularization, Overrepresented groups' average ranking increases dramatically, Model becomes unstable with oscillating performance across training epochs

- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline comparison: Run ProtoMF without any modifications to establish baseline performance and fairness metrics, 2. Ablation study: Test Prototype K-filtering alone vs Prototype-Distributing Regularizer alone to understand individual contributions, 3. Hyperparameter sweep: Systematically vary k values and regularization strength to find optimal balance between performance and fairness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the Prototype-Distributing Regularizer perform across different cultural dimensions beyond country of origin (e.g., ethnicity, language, religion)? The paper notes that culture is more complex than country of origin and acknowledges this as a limitation.

### Open Question 2
What is the theoretical justification for why k-filtering and prototype distribution techniques improve fairness in prototype-based matrix factorization? The authors note that "the theoretical justification for the effectiveness of k-filtering and the regularization techniques is not thoroughly established."

### Open Question 3
How does the trade-off between recommendation performance (HR@10, NDCG@10) and fairness metrics vary across different application domains and dataset characteristics? The paper shows varying performance-fairness trade-offs across datasets but doesn't provide a systematic analysis of when and why these trade-offs occur.

## Limitations
- Relies on country of origin as a proxy for cultural identity, which may oversimplify complex cultural dynamics
- No explicit validation of the cultural proxy assumption is provided
- Performance gains are modest (2% in HitRatio@10) and may not justify added complexity for all use cases

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Prototype K-filtering effectively reduces popularity bias by localizing representation to k nearest prototypes
- Medium Confidence: Prototype-Distributing Regularizer improves cultural diversity through uniform prototype distribution
- Medium Confidence: Country of origin serves as an adequate proxy for cultural identity in recommender systems

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies or qualitative analysis to verify that country of origin accurately captures cultural identity and preferences in the datasets
2. Systematically test the individual and combined effects of Prototype K-filtering and Prototype-Distributing Regularizer across different k values and regularization strengths
3. Apply the framework to recommendation domains beyond cultural content to evaluate whether the bias mitigation mechanisms generalize beyond the cultural context
