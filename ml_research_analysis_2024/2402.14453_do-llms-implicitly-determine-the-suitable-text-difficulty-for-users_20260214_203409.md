core_contribution: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance personalized
  education by adjusting text difficulty to match student comprehension levels. However,
  most existing approaches require task-specific tuning or explicit instructions about
  difficulty levels, limiting their applicability across diverse educational domains.

# Do LLMs Implicitly Determine the Suitable Text Difficulty for Users?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14453
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: LLMs can implicitly adjust text difficulty between user input and output without explicit difficulty prompts

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can automatically adjust text difficulty to match user comprehension levels without explicit instructions. The research evaluates multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs on technical Stack-Overflow and TSCC dialogue datasets, measuring their ability to maintain consistent difficulty levels between input questions and generated responses. Results demonstrate that instruction-tuned models like LLaMA-2-chat, Vicuna, and Mistral-Instruct can implicitly handle text difficulty, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 showing particularly strong performance. Notably, instruction-tuning proved more important than model size for this capability.

## Method Summary
The researchers created a Stack-Overflow dataset containing 1,000 question-answer pairs and evaluated multiple LLMs on both this dataset and the TSCC dialogue dataset. They measured text difficulty using automated metrics like Flesch-Kincaid scores and perplexity-based difficulty measures. The evaluation compared correlations between input and output text difficulty across different LLM variants, including both open-source models and proprietary systems like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Instruction-tuned models were specifically compared against their base counterparts to assess the impact of fine-tuning on difficulty adjustment capabilities.

## Key Results
- Instruction-tuned models (LLaMA-2-chat, Vicuna, Mistral-Instruct) achieved high correlations between input and output text difficulty
- GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated particularly strong ability to maintain appropriate difficulty levels across both datasets
- Instruction-tuning proved more important than model size for implicit difficulty adjustment capability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The implicit difficulty adjustment capability emerges from the models' training objectives and fine-tuning processes. When models are instruction-tuned on diverse datasets containing various complexity levels, they learn to maintain consistency in response characteristics relative to input. The models appear to capture contextual cues about appropriate complexity levels and adjust their output accordingly. This suggests that the difficulty adjustment is not a separate learned skill but rather an emergent property of comprehensive instruction tuning that teaches models to maintain consistency with user inputs across multiple dimensions, including complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- Text complexity metrics (Flesch-Kincaid, perplexity): Why needed - to quantitatively measure difficulty levels across texts; Quick check - calculate scores for sample sentences to verify they reflect perceived difficulty
- Instruction tuning vs base models: Why needed - to understand how fine-tuning affects capability emergence; Quick check - compare performance of instruction-tuned vs base versions on same tasks
- Correlation analysis: Why needed - to measure relationship between input and output difficulty; Quick check - calculate Pearson correlation on sample datasets
- Educational scaffolding principles: Why needed - to contextualize difficulty adjustment in learning contexts; Quick check - review literature on optimal difficulty progression in education

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User input -> LLM processing -> Difficulty analysis -> Response generation -> Output
Critical path: User question is analyzed for difficulty level, LLM generates response maintaining similar complexity, final output preserves appropriate difficulty level
Design tradeoffs: Instruction-tuned models sacrifice some general capability for specialized consistency; open-source models trade performance for accessibility
Failure signatures: Disconnected difficulty (high input, low output or vice versa); overly simplified responses; inconsistent complexity patterns
First experiments:
1. Test correlation between input and output difficulty on small controlled dataset
2. Compare instruction-tuned vs base model performance on difficulty maintenance
3. Evaluate different difficulty metrics for consistency and reliability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No evaluation of actual comprehension outcomes or learning effectiveness
- Dataset composition limited to technical programming content and specific dialogue contexts
- Unclear whether consistent difficulty is always pedagogically optimal

## Confidence
High: LLMs can implicitly adjust text difficulty between input and output based on automated readability metrics
Medium: Instruction-tuned models perform better than base models for difficulty adjustment
Low: LLMs' implicit difficulty adjustment translates to improved educational outcomes

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies measuring actual comprehension and learning outcomes when students interact with LLM-adjusted content across multiple subjects and grade levels, comparing against both static difficulty materials and explicitly difficulty-guided LLM responses
2. Test the implicit difficulty adjustment capability across diverse educational domains including humanities, sciences, and mathematics with content appropriate for different age groups (elementary through university level)
3. Evaluate whether maintaining consistent difficulty between input and output always represents optimal pedagogical practice, particularly for scaffolding learning where strategically varied difficulty might be more effective
