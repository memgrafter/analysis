# Towards a Fully Interpretable and More Scalable RSA Model for Metaphor Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.02983
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02983
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: RSA model achieves r = .64 correlation with human metaphor interpretations using explicit communicative goal formula and gradient-based rationality learning

## Executive Summary
This study addresses critical limitations in Rational Speech Act (RSA) models for metaphor understanding, specifically poor interpretability, scalability issues, and high computational costs. The authors propose a novel RSA framework that introduces an explicit formula for estimating communicative goals based on mutual information between speaker and listener, and employs gradient-based methods to learn the rationality parameter. Tested on 24 diverse metaphors including both conventional and non-conventional types, the model demonstrates strong positive correlation (r = .64) between generated distributions and human interpretations, with particularly strong performance (r = .80) when intended meanings relied on inherent vehicle properties.

## Method Summary
The proposed RSA model introduces a closed-form formula R(g|t) for computing communicative goal probabilities based on topic context, and learns the rationality parameter λ through gradient-based optimization rather than data interpolation. The model represents features as graded typicality values on a continuous scale [0,1], capturing nuanced degrees of typicality. It employs Bayesian inference framework with literal listener, pragmatic speaker, and pragmatic listener components to derive metaphor interpretations. The rationality parameter λ is optimized to 44.43 using conjugate gradient algorithm, and the model is evaluated on 24 metaphors with human behavioral data from three experiments measuring feature elicitation, typicality ratings, and metaphor interpretation.

## Key Results
- Model achieves r = .64 correlation between generated distributions and human interpretations overall
- Performance increases significantly to r = .80 when intended meanings rely on inherent vehicle properties
- Strong positive correlation (r = .88) between model and GPT-XL interpretations suggests RSA mechanisms may be embedded in LLMs
- Jensen-Shannon Divergence of JSD = .23 indicates model distributions closely match human interpretation distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Introducing a closed-form formula for communicative goal probability (R(g|t)) improves interpretability.
- Mechanism: By explicitly modeling how topic context influences the probability distribution over communicative goals, the model provides a transparent link between input (topic) and output (interpretation distribution). This replaces opaque data interpolation with a mathematically defined function.
- Core assumption: The topic of a metaphor provides sufficient minimal context to estimate relevant communicative goals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introduces a new RSA framework... by providing an explicit formula - based on the mutually shared information between the speaker and the listener - for the estimation of the communicative goal"
  - [section 2] "we explicitly encode the fact that the communicative goals are considered non-uniformly by conditioning the associated probability distribution to the conversational context"
- Break condition: If metaphors require richer contextual information beyond the topic, or if the topic-vehicle relationship is too complex for a closed-form solution.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learning the rationality parameter λ using gradient-based methods improves scalability.
- Mechanism: Instead of interpolating λ from data, the model uses unconstrained optimization (conjugate gradient algorithm) to learn λ directly from training data. This reduces computational costs and enables the model to handle larger datasets efficiently.
- Core assumption: The rationality parameter is invariant to context and can be learned from a limited sample of metaphors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "by learning the rationality parameter using gradient-based methods"
  - [section 2] "our model learns the parameter λ from data via a modern machine learning technique, namely unconstrained optimization through the conjugate gradient algorithm"
- Break condition: If λ varies significantly across contexts or if the optimization landscape is too complex for gradient methods to find good solutions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modeling features as graded typicality values (rather than binary) improves expressiveness.
- Mechanism: By representing features on a continuous scale [0,1] and ensuring they sum to 1, the model captures nuanced degrees of typicality. This allows for more precise modeling of how features relate to both topics and vehicles.
- Core assumption: Metaphorical interpretation benefits from a fine-grained quantification of feature typicality rather than a simple present/absent distinction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "This range for the entries of f leads to a more fine-grained quantification of typicality with respect to the work of Kao et al., where the entries were Boolean"
- Break condition: If binary feature representations are sufficient for accurate metaphor interpretation, or if the computational cost of continuous values outweighs the benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian inference and RSA framework
  - Why needed here: The model is built on RSA principles, which rely on Bayesian reasoning to model pragmatic interpretation. Understanding how listeners infer speaker intentions through probability distributions is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: How does the RSA model use Bayesian inference to derive the listener's interpretation of a metaphor?

- Concept: Mutual information and communicative goals
  - Why needed here: The explicit formula R(g|t) is based on mutually shared information between speaker and listener. Understanding mutual information helps grasp how the model quantifies the relevance of communicative goals.
  - Quick check question: What role does mutual information play in determining the probability distribution over communicative goals in this model?

- Concept: Optimization and gradient-based learning
  - Why needed here: The model learns the rationality parameter λ using gradient-based methods. Familiarity with optimization techniques is crucial for understanding how the model improves scalability.
  - Quick check question: Why is gradient-based optimization more scalable than data interpolation for learning the rationality parameter in RSA models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input metaphors → R(g|t) computation → λ optimization → Utility function → S1 utterance selection → L1 Bayesian inference → Output interpretation distributions

- Critical path: Input metaphors → R(g|t) computation → λ optimization → Utility function → S1 utterance selection → L1 Bayesian inference → Output interpretation distributions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. complexity: The closed-form formula improves interpretability but may oversimplify complex contextual relationships
  - Scalability vs. accuracy: Gradient-based learning improves scalability but might miss nuanced parameter values that interpolation could capture
  - Graded vs. binary features: Continuous typicality values provide more expressiveness but increase computational complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor correlation between model and human interpretations (r < 0.5)
  - High Jensen-Shannon Divergence (> 0.5) indicating dissimilar distributions
  - Optimization fails to converge or produces unstable λ values
  - Model performs well on conventional metaphors but poorly on creative ones

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the model on a small set of conventional metaphors (e.g., "John is a shark") to verify basic functionality and compare with previous RSA models
  2. Evaluate the impact of removing R(g|t) through ablation study to quantify its contribution to model performance
  3. Test the model on metaphors with non-vehicle-inherent properties to assess its ability to handle creative interpretations beyond typicality-based reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can RSA models be extended to capture the creative nuances of metaphorical meaning that go beyond inherent lexical properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that the more creative nuances of metaphorical meaning, not strictly encoded in the lexical concepts, are challenging for machines and remain unresolved.
- Why unresolved: The study shows that while the model performs well on metaphors with vehicle-inherent properties, it struggles with those relying on non-inherent properties, suggesting that typicality-based models have limitations in capturing creative metaphors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence could include experimental results demonstrating improved model performance on creative metaphors after incorporating additional mechanisms, such as mindreading, sensory-based experience, or emotional impact.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can machine learning optimization techniques be generalized to other pragmatic phenomena beyond metaphor comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that machine learning optimization could be used to design novel algorithms for metaphor comprehension and other pragmatic phenomena.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on metaphor comprehension as a test case, but it remains unclear whether the proposed approach can be effectively applied to other areas of pragmatics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence could include successful applications of the proposed approach to other pragmatic phenomena, such as scalar implicatures or hyperbole, with comparable or improved performance to existing models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the underlying mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) that enable them to perform well on certain linguistic tasks but struggle with metaphor and pragmatic understanding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that preliminary evidence suggests a strong correlation between metaphor interpretation given by the RSA model and GPT-XL, indicating that RSA mechanisms might be embedded in LLMs.
- Why unresolved: While the study provides initial evidence of a connection between RSA and LLMs, the specific mechanisms underlying LLMs' performance on linguistic tasks remain unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence could include detailed analyses of LLMs' internal representations and processes, revealing how they handle metaphorical and pragmatic aspects of language, and comparisons with RSA models to identify similarities and differences.

## Limitations
- Small dataset of only 24 metaphors limits statistical power and generalizability
- Model struggles with non-vehicle-inherent metaphors (r = .48), suggesting limitations in handling creative interpretations
- Explicit formula for communicative goals may oversimplify complex contextual relationships
- Scalability claims require validation on larger metaphor corpora

## Confidence
- Correlation results (r = .64 overall): High confidence
- Performance on vehicle-inherent properties (r = .80): High confidence  
- Scalability claims: Medium confidence
- Ability to handle creative metaphors: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on a larger, more diverse metaphor corpus (minimum 100 examples) to verify scalability and robustness across different metaphor types and domains.

2. Conduct ablation studies removing the R(g|t) component to quantify its specific contribution to model performance and interpretability gains.

3. Evaluate the model's performance on metaphors with non-vehicle-inherent properties that require richer contextual understanding beyond typicality ratings.
