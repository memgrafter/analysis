# MathBench: Evaluating the Theory and Application Proficiency of LLMs with a Hierarchical Mathematics Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12209
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12209
- Authors: Hongwei Liu; Zilong Zheng; Yuxuan Qiao; Haodong Duan; Zhiwei Fei; Fengzhe Zhou; Wenwei Zhang; Songyang Zhang; Dahua Lin; Kai Chen
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Models perform well on basic arithmetic but struggle with complex problems in higher educational stages, revealing significant gaps between theoretical understanding and application capabilities.

## Executive Summary
MathBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across five educational stages, from basic arithmetic to college-level mathematics. The benchmark includes 3,709 bilingual questions in Chinese and English, assessing both theoretical understanding and practical application skills. Extensive experiments on over 20 models reveal that while models excel at basic mathematics, their effectiveness drastically declines for complex problems, highlighting significant gaps in conceptual understanding and problem-solving strategies.

## Method Summary
MathBench employs a hierarchical knowledge system with five main educational stages and three fine-grained knowledge levels, featuring both theoretical and application problems. The benchmark includes 3,709 questions in Chinese and English, each tagged with metadata indicating stage, subject area, and topic. Evaluation uses Circular Evaluation (CE) for chat models and Perplexity (PPL) for base models through the OpenCompass framework, with standardized maximum output length and decoding strategy. The dataset was generated through self-collection and open-source aggregation, followed by semi-automated quality screening.

## Key Results
- Models show strong performance on arithmetic and primary level mathematics but experience significant performance drops at middle, high, and college stages
- A substantial gap exists between theoretical understanding and application capabilities, particularly in advanced stages
- Bilingual evaluation reveals linguistic versatility challenges, with models struggling to maintain consistent performance across Chinese and English question sets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical difficulty scaling enables finer-grained performance diagnosis than unidimensional benchmarks
- Mechanism: MathBench's five-stage taxonomy (Arithmetic → Primary → Middle → High → College) maps to educational progression, allowing models to be evaluated at increasing depth and complexity. Each stage contains both theoretical and application problems, exposing specific knowledge gaps
- Core assumption: Performance drops at higher stages reflect genuine conceptual difficulty rather than question formulation bias
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The benchmark progresses through five distinct stages, from basic arithmetic to college mathematics, and is structured to evaluate models at various depths of knowledge"
- Break condition: If models exhibit plateaued performance across all stages, the hierarchical structure offers no diagnostic advantage

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bilingual evaluation reveals linguistic versatility in mathematical reasoning
- Mechanism: MathBench includes parallel Chinese and English question sets, enabling assessment of models' ability to process mathematical concepts across languages, capturing nuanced understanding beyond single-language benchmarks
- Core assumption: Performance differences between languages reflect genuine linguistic processing capabilities, not translation artifacts
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MathBench aims to enhance the evaluation of LLMs' mathematical abilities, providing a nuanced view of their knowledge understanding levels and problem solving skills in a bilingual context"
- Break condition: If bilingual performance gaps are solely due to translation quality, the diagnostic value diminishes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge-tagged metadata enables granular topic-level performance analysis
- Mechanism: Each question in MathBench is tagged with stage, subject area, and topic metadata, allowing researchers to pinpoint specific mathematical domains where models excel or struggle
- Core assumption: Fine-grained tagging is accurate and consistently applied across the dataset
- Evidence anchors: [section] "In MathBench, each question is tagged with metadata indicating its stage (Primary, Middle, High, College, or Arithmetic), subject area, and topic"
- Break condition: If metadata tagging is inconsistent, topic-level insights become unreliable

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical educational progression
  - Why needed here: Understanding how mathematical complexity builds from arithmetic to college-level topics is essential for interpreting benchmark results and designing appropriate evaluation strategies
  - Quick check question: Why does MathBench use five educational stages rather than a single difficulty scale?

- Concept: Bilingual mathematical processing
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the importance of linguistic versatility in mathematical reasoning tasks helps in evaluating model capabilities beyond monolingual benchmarks
  - Quick check question: How does bilingual evaluation in MathBench differ from traditional monolingual math benchmarks?

- Concept: Metadata tagging and categorization
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of how questions are tagged by stage, subject area, and topic is crucial for interpreting granular performance data and identifying specific knowledge gaps
  - Quick check question: What metadata tags are applied to each question in MathBench?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question collection → Quality screening → Metadata tagging → Evaluation execution (CE/PPL) → Performance analysis → Result interpretation
- Critical path: Question collection → Quality screening → Metadata tagging → Evaluation execution → Performance analysis → Result interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing question diversity with quality control, choosing between open-ended and multiple-choice formats, and deciding on evaluation protocols that maximize robustness while minimizing computational cost
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent metadata tagging, low inter-annotator agreement in quality screening, evaluation protocol biases, and performance gaps that cannot be explained by stage difficulty
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a small set of questions across all stages to verify the hierarchical difficulty progression
  2. Run bilingual evaluation on a subset to test linguistic versatility and identify potential translation issues
  3. Perform topic-level analysis on a sample to validate metadata tagging accuracy and consistency

2. Perform translation quality assessment by having bilingual mathematics experts evaluate 50 parallel Chinese-English question pairs for semantic equivalence and mathematical accuracy
3. Test the benchmark's hierarchical difficulty progression using human expert evaluation, where mathematicians rank questions by complexity to validate the staged organization aligns with actual mathematical difficulty progression
