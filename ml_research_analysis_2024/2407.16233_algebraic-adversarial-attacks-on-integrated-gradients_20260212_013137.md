# Algebraic Adversarial Attacks on Integrated Gradients

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.16233
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16233
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: Novel algebraic framework for generating adversarial examples that preserve classification while drastically altering integrated gradients explanations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to generating adversarial examples that specifically target explainability models, focusing on integrated gradients as a path attribution method. By leveraging group-theoretic properties and Lie algebra theory, the authors demonstrate how symmetries in neural networks can be exploited to create adversarial examples that maintain the same classification while significantly altering explanations. The work provides a mathematically rigorous framework for understanding how algebraic structures can be used to generate targeted attacks on model interpretability.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce algebraic adversarial examples by exploiting symmetries in neural networks through group-theoretic and Lie algebra approaches. The core method involves identifying groups of symmetries related to the kernel and symmetry properties of the network's weight matrix, then using these groups to generate adversarial perturbations. This approach is specifically designed to target integrated gradients explanations while preserving the original classification output. The framework is theoretically validated for several common baseline choices used in integrated gradients, providing a mathematically tractable method for generating targeted attacks on explainability.

## Key Results
- Adversarial examples can be constructed that maintain classification but drastically alter integrated gradients explanations
- Group-theoretic properties of neural networks can be leveraged to generate these adversarial examples
- The approach is theoretically validated for several common integrated gradients baseline choices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by exploiting inherent symmetries in neural network weight matrices through group-theoretic and Lie algebra approaches. These algebraic structures create invariant properties in the network that can be manipulated to generate adversarial examples. By targeting the mathematical foundations of integrated gradients calculations, the method can preserve classification outputs while significantly altering the attribution explanations.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Lie Groups and Algebras**
   - Why needed: Provides the mathematical framework for understanding continuous symmetries in neural networks
   - Quick check: Can you explain how Lie algebras relate to infinitesimal transformations in neural networks?

2. **Integrated Gradients**
   - Why needed: The specific explainability method being targeted by the adversarial attacks
   - Quick check: Can you describe how integrated gradients calculates feature attributions along a path?

3. **Neural Network Symmetries**
   - Why needed: Identifies the exploitable properties that enable the algebraic attacks
   - Quick check: Can you identify examples of symmetry-preserving transformations in common network architectures?

4. **Kernel Properties of Weight Matrices**
   - Why needed: Understanding how the null space of weight matrices relates to adversarial example generation
   - Quick check: Can you explain how the kernel of a weight matrix affects gradient flow?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Neural Network (with symmetry properties) -> Integrated Gradients Calculation -> Explanation Output

**Critical Path**: The attack specifically targets the gradient computation path used in integrated gradients, exploiting symmetries in the weight matrices to generate perturbations that affect explanation calculations while preserving classification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The algebraic approach trades computational complexity for mathematical rigor, requiring specific symmetry properties that may not exist in all network architectures. This creates a balance between theoretical soundness and practical applicability.

**Failure Signatures**: The approach may fail when network architectures lack sufficient symmetry properties, or when integrated gradients baselines don't align with the theoretical assumptions about group structures.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test algebraic attack generation on a simple fully-connected network with known symmetries
2. Verify that generated adversarial examples preserve classification while altering integrated gradients
3. Compare explanation distortion against traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework relies heavily on specific mathematical assumptions about network symmetries
- Practical applicability to real-world models with non-ideal symmetries remains uncertain
- Limited empirical validation across diverse network architectures and datasets

## Next Checks

1. Test the algebraic adversarial attack framework on pre-trained networks from standard benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR) to assess real-world applicability
2. Compare the effectiveness of algebraic adversarial examples against traditional gradient-based attacks in terms of explanation distortion
3. Evaluate whether the proposed attacks transfer across different network architectures and whether defenses against gradient-based attacks also mitigate algebraic attacks
