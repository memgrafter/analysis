# Bi-Level Spatial and Channel-aware Transformer for Learned Image Compression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.03842
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03842
- Authors: Hamidreza Soltani; Erfan Ghasemi
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes a novel Transformer-based approach for learned image compression that achieves better PSNR values across various bitrates on the Kodak dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of existing learned image compression methods, which often overlook the frequency characteristics of images, leading to suboptimal compression efficiency. The authors propose a novel Transformer-based approach that enhances the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map. The core method introduces a Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB), which independently handles high and low frequencies at the attention layer and captures information across channels using a Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module. Additionally, a Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) is incorporated to enhance the extraction of diverse and rich information crucial for effective compression. Experimental results on the Kodak dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art learned image compression methods in terms of rate-distortion performance, achieving better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values across various bitrates.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB) that handles high and low frequencies independently at the attention layer. It also employs a Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module to capture information across channels and a Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) to extract diverse and rich information crucial for effective compression. The approach aims to enhance the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map, addressing a key limitation of existing learned image compression methods.

## Key Results
- The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art learned image compression methods in terms of rate-distortion performance
- Achieves better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values across various bitrates on the Kodak dataset
- The method addresses the limitations of existing approaches by considering frequency characteristics within the feature map

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by introducing a Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB) that handles high and low frequencies independently at the attention layer. This approach allows the model to capture more nuanced information within the feature map, leading to improved compression efficiency. Additionally, the Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module and Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) work together to extract diverse and rich information crucial for effective compression.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input Image -> Feature Extraction -> HSCATB -> CaSA -> MLGFFN -> Entropy Coding -> Compressed Output
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves the Feature Extraction stage, followed by the HSCATB, CaSA, and MLGFFN modules, which work together to enhance the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The proposed method trades increased computational complexity for improved compression efficiency by introducing novel Transformer-based modules
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes may include overfitting to the Kodak dataset, difficulty in handling diverse real-world content, and challenges in optimizing the rate-distortion trade-off for different image types
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Implement and evaluate the HSCATB module on a small subset of the Kodak dataset
  2. Compare the performance of the CaSA module against standard self-attention mechanisms
  3. Analyze the impact of the MLGFFN on the overall compression efficiency and image quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reported improvements are demonstrated primarily on the Kodak dataset, which is relatively small (24 images) and may not generalize well to diverse real-world content
- The absence of experiments on larger datasets like CLIC or DIV2K raises questions about the robustness of the observed rate-distortion gains
- While the HSCATB and CaSA modules are described as novel, the ablation studies are not detailed enough to quantify the marginal benefit of each component versus simpler alternatives

## Confidence
- **Confidence in claimed improvements**: Medium
  - The rate-distortion curves and PSNR gains over prior art are promising, but the lack of cross-dataset validation and limited architectural comparisons temper confidence
- **Technical clarity**: High
  - The descriptions of attention mechanisms are clear, but implementation details such as training hyperparameters, bit allocation, and entropy coding specifics are sparse

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on at least one large, diverse dataset (e.g., CLIC or DIV2K) to verify generalization of rate-distortion gains
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of HSCATB, CaSA, and MLGFFN modules to quantify their individual impact
3. Compare against recent hybrid Transformer and non-Transformer SOTA methods on standard benchmarks to contextualize the improvement margin
