# Self-supervised Speech Models for Word-Level Stuttered Speech Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10704
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10704
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Word-level stuttering detection model using WavLM achieves superior performance on clinical dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a word-level stuttering detection model using WavLM and a hierarchical convolution interface, achieving superior performance on a newly curated clinical dataset. The model outperforms existing approaches, including utterance-level baselines, on both word-level and utterance-level metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised speech models for stuttering detection. Ablation studies show that the hierarchical convolution interface and CTC loss improve performance, and the model scales well with limited fine-tuning data. This work advances stuttering detection toward clinical applicability by enabling fine-grained, automated screening.

## Method Summary
The approach uses WavLM Large as a frozen backbone with a hierarchical convolution interface to aggregate information across multiple layers for word-level stuttering detection. The model is trained in two stages: first pre-training on LibriSpeech with synthetic disfluency augmentations using CTC loss for phoneme prediction, then fine-tuning on SEP-28K utterance-level data. The hierarchical convolution structure captures both fine-grained frame-level patterns and higher-level contextual information needed for detecting stuttering events. Evaluation is performed on a clinical word-level dataset using F1 score, precision, recall, and Average Precision metrics.

## Key Results
- WavLM-based model outperforms utterance-level baselines on word-level clinical dataset
- Hierarchical convolution interface and CTC loss improve performance in ablation studies
- Model achieves better utterance-level performance than utterance-level trained models
- Model scales well with limited fine-tuning data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The WavLM backbone improves stuttering detection by providing rich contextual representations across multiple layers.
- Mechanism: WavLM's self-supervised pretraining on large untranscribed speech allows it to learn general speech features that transfer well to stuttered speech detection, even with limited labeled data.
- Core assumption: Speech SSL models learn transferable representations that are useful for stuttering detection across different speech types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "speech SSL models demonstrate high generalizability across different speech processing tasks"
  - [section]: "Due to the advantage of reducing the need for disfluency-labeled data, speech SSL models are a promising approach to tackling stuttered speech detection problems"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related stuttering detection papers but no direct comparison of WavLM vs other SSL models
- Break condition: If stuttering events have acoustic patterns too dissimilar from fluent speech, the SSL representations may not capture the relevant features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hierarchical convolution interface aggregates information across multiple WavLM layers for better stuttering detection.
- Mechanism: Instead of using a single layer or simple weighted sum, the hierarchical convolution structure captures both fine-grained frame-level patterns and higher-level contextual information needed for detecting stuttering events.
- Core assumption: Stuttering detection requires information from multiple time scales and representation levels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we adopt the recent Hierarchical Convolution Interface (HConv.) as our method for utilizing the WavLM backbone"
  - [section]: "we decided to use HConv. due to its ability to aggregate information across multiple layers"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus about hierarchical convolution specifically for stuttering
- Break condition: If the optimal information for stuttering detection is concentrated in a single layer, the hierarchical structure may add unnecessary complexity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The CTC loss on phoneme prediction provides auxiliary supervision that improves stuttering detection.
- Mechanism: Since stuttering detection and phoneme recognition use overlapping information in the SSL model, the CTC loss helps the model learn better representations for both tasks simultaneously.
- Core assumption: Phoneme boundaries and stuttering events are correlated in the speech signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "In [18], it was shown that phoneme recognition and stuttering detection tasks utilize the same set of layers in the upstream Speech SSL model"
  - [section]: "Motivated by this, we decided to add an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Loss to predict the phoneme sequences"
  - [corpus]: No corpus evidence about CTC loss specifically for stuttering detection
- Break condition: If stuttering events don't align well with phoneme boundaries, the CTC supervision may not be beneficial.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning in speech
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on pretrained WavLM which uses self-supervised learning, and the approach is justified by the success of SSL in speech processing
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between supervised and self-supervised learning in the context of speech models?

- Concept: Frame-level vs utterance-level classification
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly contrasts these two approaches and focuses on frame-level/word-level detection for clinical applicability
  - Quick check question: Why is word-level detection more clinically relevant than utterance-level for stuttering diagnosis?

- Concept: CTC loss and its applications
  - Why needed here: The paper uses CTC loss as an auxiliary task for phoneme prediction during pretraining
  - Quick check question: How does CTC loss handle the alignment problem between input frames and output labels?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: WavLM Large backbone -> Hierarchical convolution interface -> Frame-level prediction head -> CTC-based phoneme prediction head (pretraining only)
- Critical path: Pretraining on LibriSpeech with synthetic disfluencies -> Finetuning on SEP-28K -> Evaluation on clinical word-level dataset
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hierarchical convolution vs single layer selection: better performance but more complex
  - CTC auxiliary loss: improved performance but requires phoneme labels during pretraining
  - Freezing WavLM layers: faster training but less model adaptation
- Failure signatures:
  - Low recall on word-level dataset indicates model misses stuttering events
  - High precision but low recall suggests conservative predictions
  - Poor utterance-level performance indicates fundamental architecture issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Implement the "Baseline [21]" model and verify it reproduces the reported results
  2. Layer selection: Test different WavLM layers individually to understand which layers capture stuttering information best
  3. Interface comparison: Compare hierarchical convolution vs weighted sum vs single layer approaches on the word-level dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal self-supervised speech model architecture and training strategy for word-level stuttering detection in diverse clinical populations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares WavLM with Wav2vec2.0 and Data2vec, showing WavLM performs best. It also tests different hierarchical convolution interfaces and CTC loss.
- Why unresolved: The study used a limited dataset and did not explore all possible model architectures or training strategies. Performance may vary with larger, more diverse datasets and different training approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing various SSL models, architectures, and training strategies on a large, diverse stuttering dataset with extensive ablation analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can word-level stuttering detection models be improved to better distinguish stuttering from other disfluencies and account for individual speaker differences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that the model tends to have high recall but low precision, suggesting difficulty in distinguishing stuttering from other disfluencies. It also mentions potential improvements by conditioning on patient demographics.
- Why unresolved: The current model does not explicitly model different types of disfluencies or individual speaker characteristics. This limits its ability to accurately detect stuttering in diverse speakers and contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model that explicitly models different disfluency types and incorporates speaker-specific information, evaluated on a diverse stuttering dataset with fine-grained annotations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal amount and type of training data required for robust word-level stuttering detection across different clinical settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that the model's performance improves with more training data but plateaus with the current dataset size. It also highlights the data scarcity problem in stuttering detection.
- Why unresolved: The study used a limited dataset and did not explore the impact of different data types (e.g., spontaneous vs. read speech) or clinical settings (e.g., different languages, ages, stuttering severities).
- What evidence would resolve it: A study investigating the relationship between training data size, type, and clinical setting diversity on stuttering detection performance, using a large, diverse dataset with comprehensive annotations.

## Limitations

- Performance claims rely on quality and representativeness of clinical word-level dataset that is not publicly available
- Evaluation focuses primarily on English speech, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Use of synthetic disfluencies during pretraining may not fully capture natural stuttering characteristics
- Model's performance with extremely limited training data (<100 utterances) was not extensively evaluated

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The hierarchical convolution interface improves performance over single-layer selection
- Medium Confidence: WavLM backbone outperforms utterance-level baselines
- Medium Confidence: CTC loss provides beneficial auxiliary supervision
- Low Confidence: Model scales well with limited data

## Next Checks

1. Attempt to obtain the clinical word-level dataset or request evaluation results on publicly available stuttering datasets to verify the claimed performance improvements.

2. Evaluate the model on stuttering detection in non-English languages or different speaking styles to assess cross-lingual and cross-domain performance.

3. Conduct a more rigorous study of model performance across multiple data reduction levels (5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%) with statistical significance testing to validate claims about data efficiency.
