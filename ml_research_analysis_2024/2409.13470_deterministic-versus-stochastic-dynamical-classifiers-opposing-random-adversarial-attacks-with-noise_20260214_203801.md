# Deterministic versus stochastic dynamical classifiers: opposing random adversarial attacks with noise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.13470
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13470
- Reference count: 0
- Continuous-variable firing rate model achieves 99.9% accuracy on letters dataset and 97.2% on MNIST, with stochastic variant showing improved robustness to adversarial noise

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Continuous-Variable Firing Rate (CVFR) model as a dynamically assisted classifier for image recognition tasks. The model uses spectral decomposition of a coupling matrix to create attractor states that guide different input items to their corresponding classes. A stochastic variant with multiplicative noise is also developed, which demonstrates superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to its deterministic counterpart. The approach is tested on both a letters dataset and the MNIST dataset, showing high accuracy while maintaining resilience to noise-based attacks.

## Method Summary
The CVFR model is trained using spectral decomposition of the coupling matrix to plant attractors that correspond to different classes. The deterministic model evolves according to standard differential equations, while the stochastic variant includes a multiplicative noise term that naturally fades as the system approaches attractor states. Training involves decomposing the coupling matrix into spectral components that shape the energy landscape, creating basins of attraction for each class. The multiplicative noise in the stochastic model is designed to diminish near attractors, providing a natural mechanism for noise robustness without requiring explicit denoising procedures.

## Key Results
- Deterministic CVFR model achieves 99.9% accuracy on letters dataset and 97.2% on MNIST
- Stochastic CVFR model with multiplicative noise shows superior robustness to adversarial attacks compared to deterministic version
- The multiplicative noise term naturally fades near attractors, providing implicit noise resistance
- Both models successfully classify images by evolving toward attractor states corresponding to different classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CVFR model works by creating an energy landscape with attractor states that correspond to different classes. During inference, input patterns evolve according to the dynamical system until they settle into one of these attractors, with the final resting state determining the classification. The stochastic variant's noise resilience comes from the multiplicative noise term that diminishes as the system approaches attractors, effectively creating a self-denoising mechanism. This design allows the system to naturally filter out perturbations while maintaining the ability to distinguish between different classes.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Continuous-Variable Firing Rate models**: Used to represent neural dynamics in continuous time; needed for creating differentiable dynamical systems that can be trained for classification tasks; quick check: verify the firing rate equations properly capture neural activation dynamics
2. **Spectral decomposition of coupling matrices**: Enables the planting of specific attractor structures in the dynamical system; needed to shape the energy landscape for classification; quick check: confirm that the spectral components properly create distinct basins of attraction
3. **Multiplicative noise in dynamical systems**: Provides noise that scales with system state; needed to create the self-denoising property near attractors; quick check: verify that noise amplitude properly diminishes near equilibrium points

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input -> CVFR dynamics -> Attractor states -> Classification output

Critical Path: The critical path involves input preprocessing, dynamical evolution according to CVFR equations, convergence to attractor states, and final classification based on the attractor reached.

Design Tradeoffs: The model trades computational efficiency during inference (continuous-time evolution) for robustness to adversarial attacks. The stochastic variant sacrifices some determinism for improved noise resilience. The spectral decomposition approach requires careful design of the coupling matrix but enables precise control over attractor placement.

Failure Signatures: Classification failures occur when inputs evolve to incorrect attractors, typically due to ambiguous patterns or insufficient separation between attractor basins. The system may also fail to converge within reasonable time limits for complex or noisy inputs.

First Experiments:
1. Test convergence speed for different initial conditions and input patterns
2. Verify attractor separation by measuring basin boundaries between classes
3. Evaluate noise robustness by adding controlled perturbations at different stages of evolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings are based on only two specific datasets (letters and MNIST), limiting generalizability to other domains
- Comparison focuses primarily on noise robustness rather than overall classification accuracy for the stochastic model
- Spectral decomposition method may have scalability limitations for high-dimensional problems
- The specific design of multiplicative noise that fades near attractors may not generalize to all attack types

## Confidence

High confidence in:
- Mathematical formulation of CVFR model and spectral decomposition training method
- Basic functionality of creating attractor-based classification

Medium confidence in:
- Comparative robustness results between deterministic and stochastic models
- Limited evaluation scope (only noise-based attacks tested)

Low confidence in:
- Broader implications beyond tested datasets
- Performance on complex, real-world classification tasks

## Next Checks
1. Test CVFR models on a wider range of datasets, including more complex image classification tasks and non-image data
2. Evaluate models against diverse adversarial attack methods beyond random noise, including gradient-based attacks
3. Investigate computational efficiency and scalability of spectral decomposition training for larger problems
