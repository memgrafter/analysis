# Validating Mechanistic Interpretations: An Axiomatic Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13594
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13594
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes axioms for validating mechanistic interpretations of neural networks through fidelity checks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a formal framework for validating mechanistic interpretations of neural networks through a set of axioms that measure fidelity between interpretations and the original models. The axioms require that interpretation components approximately match the model's internal activations and that substituting model components with interpretations has negligible effect on outputs. The authors demonstrate this framework by validating interpretations of two models: a Transformer solving modular addition and another solving 2-SAT problems.

The work provides a principled approach to evaluate whether mechanistic interpretations truly capture the behavior of neural networks, addressing a critical gap in interpretability research where many interpretations are proposed without rigorous validation. By introducing quantifiable metrics (epsilon values) for interpretation fidelity, the framework enables systematic comparison between different interpretation methods and provides a compositional approach to building and validating complex interpretations from simpler components.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two key axioms for validating mechanistic interpretations: First, that the interpretation's internal states must approximately match the model's intermediate activations; second, that substituting the model's components with the interpretation's components should have negligible effect on the output. These axioms are formalized through epsilon values that quantify the approximation error. The framework is applied to validate interpretations of a Transformer solving modular addition (validating Nanda et al.'s existing interpretation) and a Transformer solving 2-SAT problems (where they extract a new parsing and evaluation interpretation). The validation process involves computing maximum approximation errors across multiple test cases and comparing against baseline interpretations.

## Key Results
- Achieved epsilon values of 0.000335 when validating Nanda et al.'s modular addition interpretation
- Obtained epsilon of 0.182 for prefix equivalence in the 2-SAT interpretation, with even lower values for other components
- Demonstrated that interpretation fidelity can be systematically measured and improved through iterative refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The axiomatic approach works by providing concrete, testable criteria for what it means for an interpretation to "faithfully represent" a neural network's behavior. By requiring that interpretations match both the intermediate states and preserve output behavior under substitution, the framework ensures that interpretations capture not just surface-level correlations but the actual computational mechanisms. The compositional nature allows complex interpretations to be built from validated components, enabling systematic validation of increasingly sophisticated mechanistic explanations.

## Foundational Learning
**Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understanding how neural networks perform computations at a mechanistic level - needed to grasp why validating interpretations matters; quick check: Can you explain how a simple circuit works in terms of its components?
**Function Approximation**: Measuring how closely one function approximates another - needed to understand epsilon values; quick check: Can you calculate the maximum error between two functions over an interval?
**Transformer Architecture**: Understanding self-attention and feed-forward mechanisms - needed to follow the case studies; quick check: Can you describe the forward pass of a single Transformer layer?
**Compositionality**: Building complex systems from validated components - needed to understand the framework's approach; quick check: Can you explain how validating subcomponents helps validate the whole system?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input -> Transformer Layers -> Output (Model)
Interpretation Components (Circuits) -> Approximate -> Model Components

**Critical Path**
The validation process follows: (1) Extract interpretation, (2) Compute internal state approximations, (3) Test substitution fidelity, (4) Measure epsilon values

**Design Tradeoffs**
Manual interpretation extraction vs. automated methods; precise mathematical approximations vs. practical interpretability; component granularity vs. compositional tractability

**Failure Signatures**
High epsilon values indicate poor approximation; inconsistent epsilon across different inputs suggests non-robust interpretations; successful validation on training data but failure on test data indicates overfitting

**First Experiments**
1. Validate a simple linear model interpretation to verify the framework works on easy cases
2. Apply the framework to a known failure case to test sensitivity
3. Compare validation results across different interpretation granularities on the same model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes linear relationships between internal states and output, which may not hold for all architectures
- 2-SAT interpretation required significant manual effort to guide extraction
- Only demonstrated on relatively small, well-understood models
- Epsilon values don't directly translate to practical utility or generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- The axiomatic framework itself is mathematically sound and provides a rigorous approach to validation
- Experimental results for both case studies appear methodologically sound with appropriate statistical measures

**Medium Confidence**
- The practical utility and generalizability of interpretations validated through this framework
- Whether validated interpretations provide meaningful insights beyond just matching behavior

**Low Confidence**
- The framework's applicability to more complex, real-world models and tasks
- Scalability challenges that may arise when applying to larger models

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to a larger, more complex model (e.g., a small LLaMA model) to test scalability and identify potential bottlenecks

2. Develop automated methods for interpretation extraction that can be validated by the framework, reducing the need for manual intervention

3. Design experiments to test whether interpretations validated by this framework lead to meaningful improvements in model understanding, debugging, or modification capabilities
