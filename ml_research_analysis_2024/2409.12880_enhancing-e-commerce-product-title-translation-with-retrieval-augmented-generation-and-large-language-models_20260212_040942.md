# Enhancing E-commerce Product Title Translation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.12880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12880
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: RAG approach improves product title translation quality with chrF score gains up to 15.3% for language pairs where LLM has limited proficiency

## Executive Summary
This study presents a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to enhance e-commerce product title translation using large language models (LLMs). The method leverages existing bilingual product information to retrieve similar examples as few-shot prompts, guiding LLMs to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate translations. Experiments across 7 language pairs showed the RAG approach significantly improved translation quality, achieving chrF score gains of up to 15.3%, particularly for language pairs where the LLM has limited proficiency. The approach effectively addresses challenges in translating short, context-poor product titles with specialized terminology by providing relevant domain-specific examples.

## Method Summary
The study proposes using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve e-commerce product title translation quality. The approach builds BM25 search indices from bilingual product information (titles, bullet points, descriptions) and retrieves similar examples for each source title. These retrieved examples are incorporated as few-shot prompts into LLM generation, specifically using Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct. The system tests 1-shot and 5-shot configurations across 7 language pairs, comparing performance against baseline generation using chrF scores as the primary evaluation metric.

## Key Results
- RAG approach achieved chrF score improvements up to 15.3% for language pairs where LLM has limited proficiency
- Combined index (T.B.D.) containing titles, bullet points, and descriptions showed the greatest chrF improvements across all language pairs
- 5-shot RAG configuration generally outperformed 1-shot configuration, particularly for language pairs with LLM proficiency limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation improves translation quality by providing contextually relevant examples that address the short-text and domain-specific challenges of product titles.
- Mechanism: The RAG approach retrieves similar bilingual product information (titles, descriptions, bullet points) and incorporates them as few-shot prompts, guiding the LLM to generate translations that preserve specialized terminology and formatting conventions.
- Core assumption: Retrieved examples with high textual similarity to the source title will provide relevant context that the LLM can leverage for better translation decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "retrieves similar bilingual examples and incorporating them as few-shot prompts to enhance LLM-based product title translation"
  - [section] "By retrieving similar bilingual product information examples from this data and using them as few-shot prompts, we can guide the LLMs to generate higher quality and more contextually appropriate translations"
- Break condition: If retrieved examples have low similarity to source titles or provide irrelevant context, the RAG approach may not improve or could degrade translation quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RAG is particularly effective for language pairs where the LLM has limited proficiency, showing chrF improvements up to 15.3%.
- Mechanism: For language pairs where the base LLM lacks strong translation capabilities, the retrieved examples provide essential domain-specific knowledge and language patterns that the LLM wouldn't otherwise have access to.
- Core assumption: The bilingual catalog contains sufficient examples in the target language to provide meaningful guidance for the LLM.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiment results show that our proposed RAG approach improve product title translation quality with chrF score gains of up to 15.3% for language pairs where the LLM has limited proficiency"
  - [section] "For language pairs where the target language is not the main language of the LLM, RAG 5-shot demonstrate chrF improvements ranging from +5.9% to +15.3%"
- Break condition: If the bilingual catalog lacks sufficient coverage for low-resource language pairs, the RAG approach may not provide meaningful improvements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using a combined index of multiple product information domains (titles, bullet points, descriptions) provides more useful contextual cues than single-domain indices.
- Mechanism: The T.B.D. index containing all three product information domains provides richer context and diverse examples that help the LLM better understand product terminology, formatting conventions, and translation patterns.
- Core assumption: Product titles alone lack sufficient context for accurate translation, and additional product information domains provide complementary context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "all language pairs show the greatest increase in chrF when examples are retrieved from the T.B.D. index which contains all three product information domains"
  - [section] "This suggests that a combined index can provide more useful contextual cues to guide the LLM's product title translation task"
- Break condition: If the additional product information domains don't contain relevant context for the specific product titles being translated, the combined index may not provide meaningful benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: BM25 retrieval framework
  - Why needed here: BM25 is used to build the search index for retrieving similar bilingual product information examples
  - Quick check question: What are the key parameters in BM25 that affect retrieval relevance, and how would you tune them for this e-commerce translation task?

- Concept: Few-shot prompting with LLMs
  - Why needed here: The RAG approach relies on incorporating retrieved examples as few-shot prompts to guide the LLM's translation behavior
  - Quick check question: How does the number of few-shot examples (1-shot vs 5-shot) affect LLM performance, and what factors should determine this choice?

- Concept: chrF metric for short text evaluation
  - Why needed here: chrF is used to evaluate translation quality for product titles, which are typically short texts where character-level metrics are more reliable than word-level metrics
  - Quick check question: Why is chrF preferred over BLEU for evaluating product title translations, and what are the key differences in how these metrics handle short texts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Bilingual product information catalog -> BM25 search index -> LLM with prompt templates -> chrF evaluation system

- Critical path:
  1. Product title input → 2. BM25 retrieval from T.B.D. index → 3. Prompt construction with retrieved examples → 4. LLM generation → 5. chrF evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Retrieval speed vs. relevance quality (BM25 parameter tuning)
  - Number of retrieved examples vs. prompt token limits
  - Index freshness vs. computational cost of rebuilding
  - Domain specificity vs. coverage breadth in the catalog

- Failure signatures:
  - Low chrF improvement despite RAG implementation
  - Retrieval of irrelevant or dissimilar examples
  - LLM ignoring retrieved examples in favor of base knowledge
  - Performance degradation for certain language pairs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare chrF scores between RAG 1-shot and baseline generation for a single language pair
  2. Test different BM25 parameter configurations to optimize retrieval relevance
  3. Evaluate the impact of using single-domain vs. T.B.D. indices on translation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the RAG approach's performance vary when using different types of product information (titles, bullet points, descriptions) in combination versus individually?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "all language pairs show the greatest increase in chrF when examples are retrieved from the T.B.D. index which contains all three product information domains (title, bullet points, and description)"
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares performance between individual domains and the combined T.B.D. index, but doesn't explore the optimal combination ratios or which specific domain combinations work best for different language pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments testing various combinations of the three domain types with different weighting ratios for each language pair.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the retrieval-augmented generation approach scale with increasing catalog size and diversity of product types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions leveraging "constantly-growing bilingual product information" and discusses the dynamic nature of e-commerce, but doesn't analyze performance degradation or maintenance costs as the index grows.
- Why unresolved: The study doesn't address how retrieval quality, computational costs, or translation quality might change as the bilingual catalog expands to millions of additional products across more diverse categories.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking performance metrics as the index grows, including analysis of retrieval precision decay and computational overhead scaling.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the RAG approach perform for product title translation in specialized or niche e-commerce domains (e.g., medical supplies, technical equipment)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses challenges with "specialized terminology" in product titles but only tests on general e-commerce data.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on general e-commerce product titles, but don't evaluate whether the approach can effectively handle domain-specific terminology and conventions that may require specialized knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing the RAG approach on domain-specific catalogs (medical, technical, legal) against both baseline translation and domain-specific MT systems.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the impact of different similarity metrics on the effectiveness of the RAG approach for product title translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses BM25 for retrieval and reports similarity scores, but only explores this single retrieval mechanism.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates BM25's effectiveness, it doesn't compare against alternative similarity metrics or hybrid approaches that might better capture semantic similarity in product titles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons of multiple similarity metrics (semantic embeddings, neural reranking, etc.) across different product categories and language pairs.

## Limitations
- The study relies solely on chrF metric without qualitative assessment of translation quality improvements
- Limited exploration of alternative retrieval mechanisms beyond BM25
- No analysis of how the approach scales with increasing catalog size or handles domain-specific terminology

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in core claims due to limited qualitative validation and lack of comparison with alternative retrieval methods
- Medium confidence in scalability claims as the paper doesn't address performance degradation with larger catalogs
- Medium confidence in domain adaptability given that experiments focus on general e-commerce data rather than specialized domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a detailed qualitative analysis comparing RAG-enhanced translations with baseline translations across different product categories to verify that the improvements are meaningful and not just metric artifacts.

2. Test the RAG approach with different LLM architectures (beyond Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct) to determine if the improvements are consistent across different model families and sizes.

3. Evaluate the approach on a held-out test set from a different time period or domain to assess the robustness of the RAG improvements and identify potential overfitting to the specific product catalog used in the experiments.
