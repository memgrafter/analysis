# Evaluating and Advancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception Ability Lens

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14725
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces AbilityLens benchmark revealing stability gaps between open-source and closed-source MLLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of a unified and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in their core vision perception abilities. The authors introduce AbilityLens, a benchmark covering six key perception abilities—counting, OCR, attribute recognition, entity extraction, grounding, and structured data understanding—across diverse question types, domains, and metrics. Through comprehensive experiments on 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs, the authors reveal notable performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models in stability, identify ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during training, and find that data mixing ratio and LLM model size are primary factors behind ability conflict.

## Method Summary
AbilityLens constructs a comprehensive benchmark by compiling 11 existing datasets into over 12,000 test samples across six perception abilities. The methodology applies baseline correction to normalize different question types, computes weighted accuracy scores, and assesses stability through z-score variance across sub-metrics. The benchmark evaluates both accuracy and stability, addressing evaluation variance present in existing benchmarks. Through online evaluation during training, the framework reveals ability conflict patterns and identifies data mixing ratio and LLM model size as primary contributing factors.

## Key Results
- AbilityLens reveals significant stability gaps between open-source and closed-source MLLMs despite similar accuracy levels
- Training experiments show ability conflict and early convergence phenomena across different perception abilities
- Data mixing ratio and LLM model size are identified as primary factors behind observed ability conflict
- Composite scoring methodology successfully reduces evaluation variance across diverse benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AbilityLens reduces evaluation variance by unifying metrics across diverse benchmarks
- Mechanism: AbilityLens collects sub-metrics from 11 existing benchmarks, applies baseline correction to normalize different question types, and aggregates them into composite accuracy and stability scores for each perception ability
- Core assumption: Sub-metrics from different sources can be meaningfully combined after baseline correction
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we derive sub-metrics from source benchmarks and unify them into a single composite score to measure accuracy and stability"; [section 3.1] "We apply baseline correction to each sub-metric to align performance levels"
- Break condition: If baseline correction assumptions fail (e.g., different sub-metrics measure fundamentally different constructs), the composite scores lose validity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stability measurement via z-score variance captures evaluation consistency across diverse conditions
- Mechanism: AbilityLens computes z-scores of model performance on each sub-metric relative to other models, then uses the standard deviation of these z-scores as the stability score
- Core assumption: Variance in relative performance across sub-metrics reflects true stability of the model's perception abilities
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1] "we assess the stability of the target model by computing the variance of its z-scores across sub-metrics"; [abstract] "we assess both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse types of questions, domains, and metrics"
- Break condition: If z-scores are influenced by factors unrelated to stability (e.g., benchmark difficulty differences), the stability metric becomes unreliable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ability conflict during training can be detected and potentially mitigated through data mixing ratio and LLM model size adjustments
- Mechanism: AbilityLens enables online evaluation during training, revealing that different abilities converge at different rates and that data mixing ratio and LLM size are primary factors behind ability conflict
- Core assumption: Online evaluation can identify ability conflict patterns that inform training adjustments
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we conclude that the data mixing ratio and LLM model size are the primary factors behind the observed ability conflict"; [section 5] "we conclude that the data mixing ratio and LLM model size are the primary factors behind the observed ability conflict"
- Break condition: If ability conflict is caused by factors not captured by data mixing ratio and LLM size, the proposed mitigation strategy fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Baseline correction for different question types
  - Why needed here: Different question types have inherently different baseline performance (e.g., T/F vs. multiple-choice), making direct comparison misleading
  - Quick check question: If a model scores 60% on T/F questions (baseline 50%) and 30% on 4-choice questions (baseline 25%), which performance is relatively better after baseline correction?

- Concept: Z-score standardization for relative performance comparison
  - Why needed here: Comparing model performance across different metrics requires normalizing for metric difficulty and variance
  - Quick check question: If Model A scores 80 on Metric X (mean=70, std=10) and 60 on Metric Y (mean=50, std=5), what are its z-scores on each metric?

- Concept: Variance as stability metric
  - Why needed here: Consistent performance across diverse conditions indicates robustness, not just high average performance
  - Quick check question: If a model has z-scores of [1.2, -0.5, 0.8, 1.1] across four metrics, what is its stability score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset collection (11 source benchmarks) -> Metric unification (baseline correction and z-score standardization) -> Evaluation framework (offline accuracy/stability assessment and online training monitoring)
- Critical path: 1) Collect and preprocess benchmark data, 2) Apply baseline correction to sub-metrics, 3) Compute composite accuracy and stability scores, 4) Evaluate models using both metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive evaluation (12,000 samples across 6 abilities) vs. computational efficiency (reduced samples from large datasets)
- Failure signatures: High variance in stability scores across abilities suggests evaluation framework issues; inconsistent ability convergence during training indicates potential conflicts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run AbilityLens on a small set of diverse MLLMs to verify metric computation and identify any normalization issues
  2. Compare AbilityLens results with individual benchmark scores to validate variance reduction claims
  3. Implement online evaluation on a training checkpoint to observe ability convergence patterns and detect potential conflicts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific factors in the data mixing ratio contribute most significantly to ability conflict across different perception abilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies data mixing ratio as a primary factor behind ability conflict
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies data mixing ratio as a primary factor but does not specify which aspects of the ratio (e.g., proportion of structured data vs. OCR data) contribute most significantly to conflicts in specific abilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying the proportion of different data types in the mixing ratio while measuring ability-specific performance degradation would identify the most problematic combinations

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does model stability correlate with downstream task performance in real-world applications compared to accuracy alone?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that closed-source models achieve lower stability scores than open-source models despite similar accuracy levels, and emphasizes the importance of stability measurement
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that stability gaps exist between models, it does not investigate whether higher stability translates to better real-world performance or user satisfaction in practical applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing model performance on real-world deployment tasks where stability matters (e.g., autonomous systems, medical diagnosis) versus controlled benchmark environments would reveal the practical value of stability

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural modifications could mitigate ability conflict while maintaining overall model accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses ability conflict during training and mentions that continuous fine-tuning and model merging methods are only partially effective, suggesting architectural solutions may be needed
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on identifying ability conflict and simple mitigation strategies but does not explore whether architectural changes (e.g., specialized sub-networks for different abilities, attention mechanisms) could prevent conflicts from occurring in the first place
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing modified architectures designed to isolate or prioritize different perception abilities against the current baseline models would demonstrate whether architectural changes can effectively address ability conflict

## Limitations
- Baseline correction assumptions may not preserve meaningful performance relationships across fundamentally different question types and evaluation metrics
- Z-score variance approach for stability may be influenced by benchmark difficulty differences rather than true model stability
- Causal claims about ability conflict being primarily driven by data mixing ratio and LLM model size lack controlled experimental validation

## Confidence
- High confidence: Benchmark construction methodology and dataset compilation process are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Composite scoring methodology is theoretically sound but requires empirical validation for normalization effectiveness
- Low confidence: Causal claims about ability conflict factors are based on observational patterns rather than controlled experiments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to verify that baseline correction preserves relative performance rankings by comparing AbilityLens scores with raw benchmark scores across multiple model pairs
2. Test the stability metric's sensitivity to benchmark difficulty variations by evaluating models on modified versions of the same benchmarks with controlled difficulty differences
3. Design controlled training experiments varying data mixing ratios, LLM sizes, and training durations independently to isolate their effects on ability conflict and convergence patterns
