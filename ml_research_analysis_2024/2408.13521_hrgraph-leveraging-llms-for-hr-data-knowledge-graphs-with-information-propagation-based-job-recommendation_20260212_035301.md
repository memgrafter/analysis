# HRGraph: Leveraging LLMs for HR Data Knowledge Graphs with Information Propagation-based Job Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13521
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13521
- Authors: Azmine Toushik Wasi
- Reference count: 5
- One-line primary result: HR knowledge graphs constructed from HR documents using LLMs enable effective job recommendations (average accuracy 0.748 for top 5) and classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HRGraph, a framework for constructing HR knowledge graphs from documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework extracts entities and relationships from HR documents like CVs and job descriptions, forming structured knowledge graphs. These graphs enable downstream tasks such as job and employee recommendations, and job area classification. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HRGraph, with information propagation on KGs yielding strong recommendation results and graph neural network models (GCN, GAT) achieving slightly better performance than traditional deep learning models in job area classification.

## Method Summary
HRGraph uses Gemini LLM to extract entities and relationships from HR documents (CVs and job descriptions), then constructs knowledge graphs with nodes representing skills, education, experience, and job requirements. Node features are generated using BERT embeddings, and information propagation is applied for job recommendations. Graph neural networks (GCN, GAT) are used for job area classification. The framework is evaluated on a dataset of 200 CVs and 200 job descriptions across 20 job categories, measuring accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Key Results
- Information propagation on KGs achieves strong recommendation results with average accuracy of 0.748 for top 5 job recommendations
- Graph neural network models (GCN, GAT) slightly outperform traditional deep learning models in job area classification
- HR knowledge graphs enable effective downstream tasks including job matching and employee skill gap identification
- The framework demonstrates potential for managing HR data and enhancing various HR functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HR knowledge graphs capture structured relationships between job requirements and candidate attributes, enabling precise matching.
- Mechanism: By representing CVs and job descriptions as nodes in a graph with edges encoding skills, education, and experience, the framework enables semantic similarity computation through information propagation. The graph structure allows traversal of 3-hop neighboring nodes to find relevant matches.
- Core assumption: Skills, education, and experience entities extracted from JDs and CVs form a shared semantic space where graph topology reflects meaningful relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The resulting KG can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, including job matching, identifying employee skill gaps, and many more."
  - [section] "Using the intuition that company JDs and employee CVs or profiles should share matching entities like skills, experience, and education"
- Break condition: If entity extraction fails to capture meaningful relationships or if the shared vocabulary between JDs and CVs is insufficient, the graph structure cannot represent useful matches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Information propagation through knowledge graphs enables ranking of job recommendations based on relevance scores.
- Mechanism: The framework uses node centrality measures on sub-graphs formed by matching entities to rank job recommendations. This leverages the graph structure to aggregate evidence across multiple matching dimensions.
- Core assumption: Centrality measures in the knowledge graph sub-structure correlate with job relevance for a given candidate profile.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Node centrality within this sub-graph allows us to efficiently find and rank all relevant job nodes."
  - [section] "The information propagation framework predicts the top N ranked jobs for each individual, enabling us to assess prediction accuracy and precision"
- Break condition: If the graph topology does not meaningfully distinguish between highly relevant and less relevant jobs, centrality-based ranking will fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph neural networks can effectively classify job areas by learning patterns in the knowledge graph structure.
- Mechanism: GCN and GAT models learn node representations that encode both the semantic features (BERT embeddings) and graph topology, enabling better classification than traditional models that only use feature vectors.
- Core assumption: The graph structure contains discriminative information for job area classification that complements the semantic features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Table 2 shows that Knowledge Graph-based GNN models are equally effective and slightly better than other models."
  - [section] "In this task, we use KG-based job area classification on the CVs using two basic popular GNNs: GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2017) and GAT (Veličković et al., 2018)."
- Break condition: If the graph structure is too sparse or the semantic features dominate, GNNs may not provide significant improvement over traditional models.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: HR documents (CVs, job descriptions)
  - LLM component: Entity extraction using Gemini
  - Graph construction layer: Entity refining, relation extraction, node feature development
  - Knowledge graph: V (nodes), E (edges), X (features)
  - Downstream tasks: Information propagation for recommendations, GNNs for classification
  - Evaluation: Accuracy, precision metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Extract entities from documents using LLM
  2. Refine entities and establish relationships
  3. Generate node features using BERT
  4. Construct knowledge graph
  5. Apply information propagation for recommendations
  6. Apply GNNs for classification tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM dependency vs. accuracy: Heavy reliance on LLM for entity extraction provides flexibility but introduces reliability concerns
  - Graph construction complexity vs. downstream performance: More sophisticated graph construction may improve results but increases complexity
  - Feature dimensionality vs. computational efficiency: Higher-dimensional BERT features capture more information but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor entity extraction: LLMs produce hallucinated or irrelevant entities
  - Sparse graphs: Insufficient relationships between entities leading to disconnected components
  - Overfitting in GNNs: Models perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test entity extraction quality by manually evaluating a sample of extracted entities from CVs and JDs
  2. Verify graph construction by visualizing a small knowledge graph and checking if relationships make sense
  3. Test information propagation by manually tracing recommendation logic for a specific CV-job pair

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper acknowledges LLM unreliability and hallucinations as a primary limitation, noting instances where LLMs deviated from instructions during entity extraction. However, it does not provide systematic analysis of error types, frequency, or impact on downstream tasks. The framework's performance at scale remains untested, as experiments used only 200 CVs and 200 job descriptions across 20 job categories. The authors also note that default GCN and GAT configurations were used without optimization, suggesting potential for improvement through hyperparameter tuning.

## Limitations

- Heavy dependence on LLM reliability for entity extraction, with no systematic error analysis provided
- Limited evaluation scope with only 200 CVs and 200 job descriptions, raising generalizability concerns
- Information propagation mechanism lacks detailed algorithmic specification
- GNN models show only slight improvement over traditional models, potentially dataset-specific

## Confidence

The framework demonstrates promising results but faces several limitations that affect confidence in the claims:

- Medium confidence in knowledge graph construction quality due to LLM reliability concerns and lack of error analysis
- Low-Medium confidence in real-world applicability given limited evaluation scope (200 CVs and JDs)
- Medium confidence in comparative claims about GNN superiority over traditional models

## Next Checks

1. Conduct error analysis on LLM-extracted entities to quantify hallucination rates and identify failure patterns in entity extraction
2. Test framework performance on an external, larger HR dataset with diverse job categories to assess generalizability
3. Implement ablation studies comparing GNN performance with and without graph structure to isolate topology effects
