# Search and Society: Reimagining Information Access for Radical Futures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.17901
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17901
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: IR research must proactively set research agendas based on diverse, explicitly stated sociotechnical imaginaries rather than reactively mitigating harms

## Executive Summary
This perspective paper argues that information retrieval (IR) research must undergo a radical transformation from reactive harm mitigation to proactive agenda-setting based on diverse sociotechnical imaginaries. The author contends that current fairness and ethics research operates within constrained frames that fail to challenge underlying values and power structures. Drawing from adjacent fields like HCI, STS, and critical theory, the paper advocates for IR research grounded in pluralistic, emancipatory values and theories of change that center societal needs over user, producer, and system owner needs.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical framework rather than a computational method. It synthesizes insights from multiple disciplines to argue for a fundamental shift in how IR research is conceptualized and conducted. The approach involves engaging with diverse stakeholders, developing explicit theories of change, and challenging dominant imaginaries through cross-disciplinary collaboration. The methodology is primarily conceptual, drawing on critical theory, participatory research principles, and interdisciplinary scholarship to propose alternative research paradigms.

## Key Results
- IR research should proactively set agendas based on diverse sociotechnical imaginaries rather than reactively addressing harms
- Research must prioritize societal needs over traditional stakeholder hierarchies (societal > consumer/producer > system owner)
- Cross-disciplinary coalitions with scholars, activists, and artists are essential for developing radical alternatives to dominant IR paradigms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shifting IR research from reactive harm mitigation to proactive agenda-setting can reorient the field toward pluralistic, emancipatory sociotechnical imaginaries
- Mechanism: By making sociotechnical imaginaries explicit and developing corresponding theories of change, the IR community can collaboratively design systems that embody diverse values and challenge dominant power structures
- Core assumption: Researchers and system designers can articulate their implicit values and future visions in ways that are actionable for research agendas
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The community should aim to proactively set the research agenda for the kinds of systems we should build inspired by diverse explicitly stated sociotechnical imaginaries."
  - [section] "Our guiding future imaginaries must be informed by other academic fields, such as human-computer interaction, information sciences, media studies, design, science and technology studies, social sciences, humanities, democratic theory, and critical theory, as well as legal and policy experts, civil rights and social justice activists, and artists, among others."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus neighbors mention AI imaginaries and futures, but none directly discuss IR research agenda transformation
- Break condition: If researchers cannot reach consensus on values or if dominant institutions suppress alternative imaginaries, the shift fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decentering user, producer, and system owner needs in favor of societal needs changes what IR research prioritizes and evaluates
- Mechanism: Introducing a hierarchy of stakeholder needs (societal > consumer/producer > system owner) reframes research questions to focus on democratic participation, public health, and social justice rather than revenue or relevance metrics
- Core assumption: Societal needs can be operationalized into concrete research objectives without losing nuance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "IR system design and research should explicitly reflect how these systems should contribute to knowledge production, public education, and social movements, and that broader framing of societal concerns should be the most fundamental stakeholder need."
  - [section] "This should then be followed by concerns of the consumer and producer needs, and lastly the needs of the system owners themselves."
  - [corpus] Missing: The corpus does not contain evidence about stakeholder hierarchies or their operationalization
- Break condition: If measurement frameworks cannot capture societal impact, the hierarchy remains theoretical

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Building cross-disciplinary coalitions with scholars, activists, and artists creates spaces for radical imaginaries that challenge Big Tech dominance
- Mechanism: Participatory spaces for shared sense-making allow IR researchers to learn from feminist, queer, decolonial, anti-racist, and abolitionist perspectives, leading to alternative system designs
- Core assumption: IR researchers can effectively engage with and integrate perspectives from radically different disciplines and activist communities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our guiding future imaginaries must be co-developed with scholars from diverse fields such as human-computer interaction (HCI), information sciences, media studies, design, science and technology studies (STS), social sciences, and political sciences, as well as legal and policy experts, civil rights and social justice activists, and artist, to name a few."
  - [section] "The focus of misinformation research then should include identifying, understanding, and addressing the structural mechanisms of misinformation—e.g., data voids—as well as ground itself in the articulation of IR's role in online knowledge production, public health education, and information literacy."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus neighbors discuss AI imaginaries and futures, but do not specifically address cross-disciplinary coalition building in IR
- Break condition: If power asymmetries prevent genuine collaboration or if institutions co-opt radical perspectives, the coalition-building fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sociotechnical imaginaries
  - Why needed here: The paper's central argument depends on understanding how shared visions of desirable futures shape technology development and governance
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes sociotechnical imaginaries from general technology visions, and why does the paper emphasize their institutional stabilization?

- Concept: Theory of change
  - Why needed here: The paper argues that articulating theories of change is essential for connecting research goals to desired social impacts
  - Quick check question: How does a theory of change differ from a research plan, and what makes it particularly relevant for sociotechnical transformation?

- Concept: Decolonial computing
  - Why needed here: The paper draws on decolonial perspectives to critique existing IR research and propose alternative approaches
  - Quick check question: What are the key principles of decolonial computing, and how might they challenge conventional IR research assumptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Research agenda setter -> Theory of change builder -> Stakeholder hierarchy engine -> Cross-disciplinary coalition platform -> Radical imaginaries incubator

- Critical path:
  1. Elicit sociotechnical imaginaries from diverse stakeholders
  2. Develop corresponding theories of change
  3. Prioritize societal needs in research design
  4. Build cross-disciplinary coalitions
  5. Test radical system alternatives
  6. Measure societal impact beyond traditional IR metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth: Including many perspectives may dilute focus, but narrow inclusion risks reproducing dominant imaginaries
  - Speed vs. inclusivity: Rapid research cycles conflict with thorough cross-disciplinary collaboration
  - Measurability vs. nuance: Societal impact metrics may oversimplify complex social transformations

- Failure signatures:
  - Dominant institutions capture and neutralize radical perspectives
  - Research remains trapped in traditional IR evaluation frameworks
  - Cross-disciplinary collaboration becomes tokenistic rather than substantive
  - Theories of change become disconnected from actual research practices

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Conduct participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders to co-create alternative IR futures and document the sociotechnical imaginaries that emerge
  2. Develop a prototype evaluation framework that weights societal impact metrics (informed citizenry, social justice) alongside traditional IR measures (relevance, efficiency)
  3. Create a federated IR system design informed by feminist and decolonial principles, then test it with representative user communities for both functionality and alignment with stated values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective mechanisms for IR researchers to develop and maintain relationships with civil society organizations, legal experts, and activists to ensure diverse sociotechnical imaginaries inform research agendas?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the need for "safe spaces where IR researchers can engage with scholars from other diverse fields, legal and policy experts, activists, and artists" and stresses the importance of "building relations of solidarity" and "cross-pollination of ideas."
- Why unresolved: While the paper advocates for collaboration, it does not provide specific frameworks or methodologies for establishing and sustaining these interdisciplinary relationships in practice
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of successful interdisciplinary collaborations in IR research, documented best practices for engaging with civil society, and metrics for evaluating the impact of these partnerships on research outcomes

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can IR researchers balance the need for critical reflection on power structures with the practical demands of industry-funded research that may constrain sociotechnical imaginaries?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the tension between academic freedom and industry influence, noting that "Big tech also shapes academic research agendas in various other ways" and that "we must resist the homogenization of our research agendas towards a singular world view put forth by Big Tech capitalism."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but does not offer concrete strategies for researchers navigating funding constraints while maintaining critical perspectives
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing research outputs from industry-funded vs. independently funded IR projects, frameworks for ethical industry collaboration, and documented cases of researchers successfully challenging dominant narratives within corporate constraints

### Open Question 3
- Question: What alternative evaluation metrics and methodologies can replace leaderboard-driven research in IR to better align with societal needs and sociotechnical imaginaries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper criticizes "leaderboard-driven research" for potentially "shifting from praxis—i.e., 'reflection and action directed at the structures to be transformed'—to proxies" and argues that "improvements on benchmarks and corresponding metrics do not translate to progress on the problem the benchmark was created for."
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the limitations of current evaluation practices, it does not propose specific alternative frameworks for assessing IR research impact
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new evaluation frameworks that incorporate societal impact measures, documented case studies of IR projects using alternative assessment methods, and comparative analyses of traditional vs. alternative evaluation approaches

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide concrete methodologies for operationalizing diverse sociotechnical imaginaries into actionable research agendas
- The proposed stakeholder hierarchy lacks empirical validation and may be difficult to implement within existing IR systems
- The feasibility of building genuine cross-disciplinary coalitions that challenge Big Tech dominance remains uncertain

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The critique of current fairness and ethics research as insufficiently transformative, operating within constrained frames that fail to challenge underlying values and power structures
- Medium Confidence: The argument that shifting from reactive harm mitigation to proactive agenda-setting can reorient IR research toward pluralistic, emancipatory sociotechnical imaginaries
- Low Confidence: The feasibility of building cross-disciplinary coalitions that genuinely challenge Big Tech dominance rather than being co-opted by dominant institutions

## Next Checks

1. **Stakeholder Hierarchy Validation**: Design a pilot study comparing IR research outcomes when prioritizing societal needs versus traditional user/revenue metrics, measuring both intended and unintended consequences
2. **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration Feasibility**: Conduct structured interviews with IR researchers and scholars from HCI, STS, and critical theory to identify specific barriers and enablers for genuine interdisciplinary collaboration
3. **Sociotechnical Imaginaries Elicitation Protocol**: Develop and test a workshop protocol for eliciting and reconciling diverse sociotechnical imaginaries from stakeholders with potentially conflicting visions for IR's societal role
