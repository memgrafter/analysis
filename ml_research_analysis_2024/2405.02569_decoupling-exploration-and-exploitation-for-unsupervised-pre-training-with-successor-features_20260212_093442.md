core_contribution: This paper introduces a method to improve unsupervised pre-training
  with successor features by decoupling exploration and exploitation into separate
  agents. The proposed approach, called Non-Monolithic unsupervised Pre-training with
  Successor features (NMPS), uses a non-monolithic exploration methodology to separate
  the roles of exploitation and exploration, allowing each agent to focus on its specific
  task.

# Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation for Unsupervised Pre-training with Successor Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02569
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: NMPS improves unsupervised pre-training with successor features by decoupling exploration and exploitation, outperforming monolithic methods like APS across three domains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Non-Monolithic unsupervised Pre-training with Successor features (NMPS), a method that improves unsupervised pre-training with successor features by decoupling exploration and exploitation into separate agents. The approach addresses limitations in monolithic exploration methods where the same agent must simultaneously explore new states and exploit known ones, often leading to suboptimal performance. NMPS uses a non-monolithic exploration methodology where exploitation and exploration are handled by distinct agents, allowing each to focus on its specific task. Experiments across three domains (Walker, Quadruped, and Jaco Arm) demonstrate that NMPS outperforms monolithic approaches like Active Pre-training with Successor Features (APS) and other competence-based algorithms, with the best variant achieving significant improvements over APS in Walker and Jaco Arm domains.

## Method Summary
NMPS implements a decoupled architecture where exploration and exploitation are handled by separate agents, contrasting with monolithic approaches where a single agent must balance both tasks. The exploitation agent focuses on maximizing reward in known states while the exploration agent seeks novel states without concern for immediate reward. The exploration agent uses competence-based measures to guide its search, while the exploitation agent leverages successor features for efficient policy learning. This separation allows each agent to optimize its specific objective without the compromises inherent in monolithic designs. The framework is flexible, supporting different competence-based algorithms for exploration, with NMP S_X _expl oi t e∗ showing best performance in Walker and Jaco Arm domains, while NMP S_D_sep ex _D_A10 performed best in the Quadruped domain.

## Key Results
- NMPS outperforms monolithic exploration methods like APS across all three tested domains
- The NMP S_X _expl oi t e∗ variant achieved significant improvements over APS in Walker and Jaco Arm domains
- NMP S_D_sep ex _D_A10, using competence-based exploration, showed best performance in the Quadruped domain
- Different NMPS variants perform best in different domains, suggesting domain-specific effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The decoupling mechanism works by separating the inherently conflicting objectives of exploration and exploitation. In monolithic approaches, agents must balance between exploring new states and exploiting known rewards, leading to suboptimal performance in both tasks. By assigning these tasks to separate agents, NMPS eliminates this trade-off. The exploration agent can pursue novelty without concern for immediate reward, while the exploitation agent can focus on maximizing returns in known states. This specialization allows each agent to develop more refined policies for its specific objective, leading to improved overall performance. The success of different NMPS variants in different domains suggests that the method's flexibility in choosing competence-based exploration algorithms allows it to adapt to domain-specific characteristics.

## Foundational Learning
- Successor Features: A representation learning technique that captures the expected cumulative features under a policy; needed for efficient transfer learning and policy evaluation; quick check: verify the agent can predict future feature expectations
- Unsupervised Pre-training: Training agents without explicit reward signals; needed to bootstrap learning in environments with sparse or delayed rewards; quick check: confirm the agent can learn useful behaviors without reward supervision
- Competence-based Exploration: Using measures of learning progress or novelty to guide exploration; needed to efficiently discover useful states and skills; quick check: verify the exploration agent visits increasingly diverse states
- Decoupled Architectures: Separating distinct learning objectives into different agents; needed to avoid conflicting optimization targets; quick check: confirm each agent improves at its specific task without interference

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: State Space -> Feature Extractor -> Exploitation Agent + Exploration Agent -> Policy Output

Critical Path: The agent receives observations, extracts features, and these features are processed by both exploitation and exploration agents in parallel. The exploitation agent uses successor features to evaluate potential actions, while the exploration agent uses competence measures to guide state visitation. The final policy combines these outputs to balance exploration and exploitation.

Design Tradeoffs: The decoupled architecture introduces additional complexity and computational overhead compared to monolithic approaches, as it requires maintaining and training two separate agents. However, this is offset by the improved performance and specialization. The method trades off simplicity for effectiveness, with the flexibility to choose different competence-based algorithms for exploration based on domain characteristics.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation occurs when the exploration agent fails to discover useful states, leaving the exploitation agent with a limited set of known states to optimize. Conversely, if the exploration agent becomes too effective, it may discover states that are difficult to exploit, leading to inefficient learning. The method may also struggle in domains where exploration and exploitation objectives are not easily separable.

First Experiments:
1. Run NMPS in a simple grid-world environment to verify the basic decoupled architecture functions correctly
2. Compare NMPS against APS in the Walker domain to confirm the reported performance improvements
3. Test different competence-based exploration algorithms within NMPS to understand their impact on performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation limited to three domains, potentially limiting generalizability
- Substantial performance gains in some domains but less pronounced in others, suggesting domain-specific effectiveness without clear explanation
- No detailed analysis of computational overhead introduced by maintaining separate agents

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core claim that decoupling exploration and exploitation improves performance compared to monolithic methods, as this is consistently demonstrated across all tested domains
- Medium confidence in the claim that NMPS is universally superior to competence-based algorithms, given that different variants perform best in different domains without clear theoretical justification
- Low confidence in the claim about general applicability beyond tested domains, as the limited scope prevents strong generalization claims

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate NMPS across a broader range of domains, particularly those with sparse rewards or high-dimensional state spaces, to test its general applicability
2. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of exploration and exploitation agents, and to assess the computational overhead introduced by the decoupled architecture
3. Implement theoretical analysis to explain why different NMPS variants perform better in specific domains, and whether this performance correlates with particular domain characteristics
