# Temporal Grounding of Activities using Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06157
- Authors: Young Chol Song
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Proposed two-stage multimodal LLM approach achieves 14.9 mIoU on Charades-STA dataset, outperforming existing video-based LLMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses temporal grounding of activities in videos by identifying specific time intervals of actions within larger event contexts. The authors propose a two-stage approach using multimodal large language models (LLMs) that combines image-based and text-based LLMs for enhanced temporal reasoning. The first stage employs a multimodal LLM to generate detailed descriptions of activities in individual video frames, while the second stage uses a text-based LLM to identify when the activity occurs within the sequence. They also explore instruction-tuning a smaller multimodal LLM to improve its ability to process action queries. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over existing video-based LLMs, achieving a 14.9 mean average IoU (mIoU) on the Charades-STA dataset.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a two-stage architecture where an image-based multimodal LLM processes individual video frames to generate detailed activity descriptions, and a text-based LLM reasons about temporal relationships using these aggregated descriptions to predict activity intervals. The authors also instruction-tune a smaller multimodal LLM using data generated by GPT-4 Vision to improve descriptive capabilities. The system processes single frames rather than video clips, finding that this provides more accurate and detailed descriptions aligned with the multimodal LLM's training distribution.

## Key Results
- Two-stage approach achieves 14.9 mIoU on Charades-STA dataset, outperforming base multimodal LLM (12.0 mIoU)
- Outperforms state-of-the-art video-based LLMs with GPT-4 Vision and GPT-4 achieving mIoU of 29.8
- Instruction-tuned 7B model shows significant improvement over base model
- Single frame input provides more accurate descriptions than video clips or multiple frames

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The two-stage architecture separates visual feature extraction from temporal reasoning, allowing each LLM to specialize in its respective task.
- Mechanism: The image-based multimodal LLM generates detailed frame-level descriptions, while the text-based LLM reasons about temporal relationships using these descriptions.
- Core assumption: Multimodal LLMs excel at generating detailed visual descriptions, but text-only LLMs are better at reasoning about temporal sequences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combining image-based and text-based large language models (LLMs) in a two-stage approach"
  - [section 3.2] "The second stage uses a text-based LLM, which utilizes descriptions aggregated with each frame output from the first stage"
  - [section 4.4] "The advantage over video-based LLMs is likely due to the higher accuracy and detail provided by image-based multimodal LLMs"
- Break condition: If text-based LLMs cannot handle the aggregated descriptions due to context length limitations, the two-stage approach would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction-tuning a smaller multimodal LLM with data generated by a larger model improves its ability to generate descriptive outputs for activity queries.
- Mechanism: The smaller model learns to produce more elaborate and activity-focused descriptions through exposure to high-quality examples.
- Core assumption: A smaller model can learn from high-quality generated data to improve its descriptive capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "instruction-tuning a smaller multimodal LLM on a dataset generated by GPT-4 Vision"
  - [section 3.1] "instruction-tuning a smaller multimodal LLM on a dataset generated by GPT-4 Vision... leads to more expressive and informative outputs"
  - [section 5] "The example shows that the tuned model provides a more descriptive output regarding the scene"
- Break condition: If the instruction-tuning data quality is poor or the smaller model cannot effectively learn from the larger model's examples, performance improvements would not materialize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using single frames as input to the multimodal LLM produces more accurate and detailed descriptions than video clips or multiple frames.
- Mechanism: Single frames provide focused input that aligns better with the multimodal LLM's training distribution and avoids confusion from multiple actions.
- Core assumption: Multimodal LLMs are better trained on single images than on video sequences or multiple images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "we use single frames from a video as input as it provides the best quality response"
  - [section 5] "we find that the multiple image and video modalities tend to give inconsistent descriptions, with the single image input mode providing the most detailed and accurate description"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers do not specifically address single frame vs. video input comparison
- Break condition: If future multimodal LLMs are trained on video data and improve at processing multiple frames, this advantage may disappear.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal activity localization
  - Why needed here: The paper's core task is identifying specific time intervals of actions within longer videos
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between temporal activity localization and action recognition?

- Concept: Multimodal LLM architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding how image-based and text-based LLMs can be combined for video understanding
  - Quick check question: How do multimodal LLMs process both visual and textual inputs?

- Concept: Instruction-tuning methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper uses instruction-tuning to improve a smaller model's performance using data from a larger model
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between standard fine-tuning and instruction-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image-based multimodal LLM → Text-based LLM → Temporal interval output
- Critical path: Video frames → Multimodal LLM description → Aggregated descriptions → Text-based LLM reasoning → Time interval prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Single frames provide better descriptions but lose temporal context; text-based LLMs need sufficient context length but larger models are more expensive
- Failure signatures: Poor R@IoU metrics, inconsistent JSON parsing from text-based LLMs, missing activity descriptions in multimodal LLM outputs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test single frame vs. video clip input on the multimodal LLM with a small subset of data
  2. Evaluate different text-based LLM and multimodal LLM combinations on the STA-Subset
  3. Compare instruction-tuned vs. base multimodal LLM performance on the same subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the limitations of using single frames versus video clips as input for multimodal LLMs in temporal activity grounding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare single frames, concatenated images, and short video clips as input modes and find that single frames provide the most detailed and accurate descriptions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores these three input modes and does not investigate other potential input configurations or the underlying reasons for the observed differences in performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing additional input modes (e.g., variable frame rates, different video clip lengths) and ablation studies to identify the key factors influencing multimodal LLM performance with different input types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed two-stage approach scale with video length and complexity of activities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors evaluate their approach on the Charades-STA dataset, which contains videos of varying lengths and activity complexities. However, they do not explicitly analyze how performance changes with these factors.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between video characteristics and model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the model on videos of different lengths and activities of varying complexity, along with statistical analysis of the results to identify trends and potential limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of instruction-tuning on the model's ability to handle out-of-distribution data or novel activities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors demonstrate that instruction-tuning improves the model's performance on the Charades-STA dataset. However, they do not evaluate its generalization capabilities.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating the model on a specific dataset and does not assess its ability to handle data or activities not seen during training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the model's performance on datasets with different activity distributions or novel activities, along with analysis of the model's robustness to out-of-distribution data.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the proposed approach compare to other methods for temporal activity grounding, such as those using specialized architectures or task-specific training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare their approach to video-based LLMs and state-of-the-art models specifically designed for temporal activity localization. However, they do not provide a comprehensive comparison with all existing methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates a subset of existing methods and does not provide a complete picture of the relative performance of different approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison of the proposed approach with all major existing methods for temporal activity grounding, including those using specialized architectures or task-specific training.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single dataset (Charades-STA), potentially limiting generalizability to other video domains
- Computational cost of running both image-based and text-based LLMs in sequence not analyzed
- Dependency on GPT-4 Vision for instruction-tuning data generation raises questions about data quality and diversity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The two-stage architecture combining image-based and text-based LLMs shows clear performance advantages over single-model approaches
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of instruction-tuning smaller multimodal LLMs, as improvements rely on generated training data quality
- **Low Confidence**: The superiority of single-frame input over video clips or multiple frames, as this claim is primarily based on internal observations

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate the two-stage approach on additional video datasets (e.g., ActivityNet, TACoS) to verify that performance gains are not specific to Charades-STA's characteristics.

2. **Instruction-Tuning Data Quality Analysis**: Compare performance when instruction-tuning on human-annotated versus GPT-4 Vision-generated data to quantify the impact of synthetic training data quality.

3. **Context Length Impact Study**: Systematically test different aggregation strategies and context lengths for the text-based LLM to determine the optimal balance between description completeness and reasoning capability.
