# Boundary Detection Algorithm Inspired by Locally Linear Embedding

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18456

- This paper proposes BD-LLE, a boundary detection algorithm for manifold data that leverages barycentric coordinates from LLE to approximate a bump function at the boundary

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of identifying boundary points from samples on an unknown compact manifold with boundary embedded in Euclidean space. The authors propose a Boundary Detection algorithm inspired by Locally Linear Embedding (BD-LLE) that leverages barycentric coordinates within the LLE framework. BD-LLE can be implemented using either an ε-radius ball scheme or a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) scheme, and it incorporates the geometric information of the manifold through its relation with the local covariance matrix. Theoretical analyses are provided for both schemes, exploring the spectral properties of the local covariance matrix to aid in parameter selection. The BD-LLE algorithm is shown to identify boundary points with high accuracy, outperforming other boundary detection algorithms in simulated examples, particularly when the manifold has a lower dimension than the ambient space.

## Method Summary
The BD-LLE algorithm identifies boundary points by computing local barycentric coordinates through LLE and constructing a boundary indicator that approximates a bump function. For each point, the algorithm finds its neighborhood (via ε-radius or KNN), computes the local covariance matrix, solves for barycentric coordinates with regularization, and calculates a boundary indicator value. The spectral properties of the local covariance matrix guide parameter selection, with eigenvalues scaling predictably with neighborhood size and sample count. The boundary indicator is thresholded to identify boundary points.

## Key Results
- BD-LLE approximates a bump function that concentrates at the boundary and decays toward the interior, achieving high detection accuracy
- Theoretical analysis characterizes eigenvalues of the local covariance matrix to guide parameter selection
- Numerical experiments show BD-LLE outperforms α-shape, BAND, BORDER, BRIM, CPS, LEVER, and SPINVER algorithms across various manifold geometries
- The method is invariant to extrinsic curvature and non-uniform data distribution, maintaining consistent performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BD-LLE leverages barycentric coordinates within LLE to construct a boundary indicator that approximates a bump function, achieving high detection accuracy.
- Mechanism: For each point zk, the algorithm computes local barycentric coordinates wk via LLE, which are directly related to the local covariance matrix. The indicator Bk is derived from wk and approximates a function B(x) that is constant on the boundary and decays rapidly toward the interior, vanishing beyond a narrow collar region.
- Core assumption: The local covariance matrix Cn,k has d large eigenvalues capturing the manifold's intrinsic geometry, while smaller eigenvalues encode extrinsic curvature and noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "BD-LLE approximates a bump function that concentrates at the boundary... This characteristic remains consistent regardless of extrinsic curvature and data distribution."
  - [section 3.2]: Proposition 3.1 explicitly shows Bk is invariant under translation/rotation and related to the regularized pseudo inverse of Cn,k.
  - [corpus]: No corpus neighbor directly confirms this exact mechanism, but Adaptive LLE papers suggest local covariance relates to manifold geometry.
- Break condition: If the regularizer c is too small or too large, Bk loses geometric information or becomes unstable, breaking the bump function behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Spectral analysis of the local covariance matrix guides parameter selection, ensuring consistent boundary detection performance.
- Mechanism: Theorem 4.1 and 4.3 characterize eigenvalues of Cn,k: d largest eigenvalues scale as nεd+2 (ε-radius) or n(K/n)d+2/d (KNN), while smaller ones scale as nεd+4 or n(K/n)d+4/d. This guides choosing c ~ nεd+3 or n(K/n)d+3/d.
- Core assumption: Sample size n is large enough that eigenvalue gaps are pronounced, and the manifold is smooth with well-defined boundary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: Theorem 4.1 provides explicit bias and variance analysis of Cn,k in the ε-radius scheme, detailing spectral properties.
  - [section 4.3]: Theorem 4.3 extends spectral analysis to the KNN scheme, with similar eigenvalue scaling.
  - [corpus]: No corpus neighbor explicitly discusses spectral properties for boundary detection, but manifold learning papers (e.g., Locally Linear Embedding) confirm eigenvalue behavior in closed manifolds.
- Break condition: If n is too small or ε/K poorly chosen, eigenvalue gaps shrink, making parameter selection ineffective and detection unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BD-LLE outperforms other algorithms because it is invariant to extrinsic curvature and non-uniform data distribution.
- Mechanism: The boundary indicator Bk depends only on intrinsic manifold geometry via the local covariance matrix, not on embedding curvature or sample density. The denominator Nk in Bk acts like a 0-1 kernel density estimator, normalizing for non-uniform distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This characteristic remains consistent regardless of extrinsic curvature and data distribution."
  - [section 4.2]: Theorem 4.2 shows Bk approximates B(x), constant on ∂M and decaying toward interior, independent of extrinsic geometry.
  - [section 5]: Numerical results show BD-LLE achieves highest F1max in examples with curved manifolds and non-uniform sampling, outperforming α-shape, BAND, BORDER, etc.
  - [corpus]: No corpus neighbor directly confirms this invariance, but manifold learning literature supports local methods' robustness to embedding.
- Break condition: If manifold dimension is close to ambient space, methods like α-shape may outperform; if boundary is very irregular, other algorithms might detect edges better.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
  - Why needed here: BD-LLE is directly inspired by LLE; understanding LLE's barycentric coordinate computation and relation to local covariance is essential to grasp BD-LLE's boundary detection mechanism.
  - Quick check question: In LLE, how are the barycentric coordinates wk for a point zk computed from its neighbors Ok?

- Concept: Manifold with boundary and Riemannian geometry
  - Why needed here: The algorithm assumes data lies on a compact manifold with smooth boundary; understanding distance to boundary, inward normal, and local covariance on such manifolds is crucial for interpreting theorems and proofs.
  - Quick check question: What is the distance to the boundary function ˜ε(x) and how does it relate to the bump function B(x)?

- Concept: Spectral analysis of covariance matrices
  - Why needed here: BD-LLE's parameter selection and theoretical guarantees rely on analyzing the eigenvalues of the local covariance matrix Cn,k; knowing how eigenvalues scale with ε, K, and n is key to applying the algorithm correctly.
  - Quick check question: In the ε-radius scheme, how do the d largest eigenvalues of Cn,k scale with ε and n?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input point cloud -> Neighborhood search (ε or K) -> Local covariance matrix construction -> Barycentric coordinate computation with regularization -> Boundary indicator calculation and thresholding -> Output boundary points
- Critical path:
  1. Neighborhood search (ε or K)
  2. Local covariance matrix construction
  3. Barycentric coordinate computation with regularization
  4. Boundary indicator calculation and thresholding
- Design tradeoffs:
  - ε-radius vs KNN: ε gives uniform collar region but requires tuning ε; KNN adapts to local density but R(x) varies, affecting bump function shape.
  - Regularizer c: Too small → instability; too large → loss of geometric information. Theoretical choice c ~ nεd+3 or n(K/n)d+3/d.
  - Thresholding: Simple fixed threshold works due to constant B(x) on boundary, but optimal choice may depend on data.
- Failure signatures:
  - Small eigenvalues not well-separated → parameter selection fails, detection unreliable.
  - Manifold dimension close to ambient → other algorithms (e.g., α-shape) may outperform.
  - Highly irregular boundary → bump function approximation breaks down.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate uniform samples on a unit circle (1D manifold in R2), apply BD-LLE with ε-radius, visualize ∂X vs true boundary.
  2. Generate non-uniform samples on a vertical-cut torus, compare BD-LLE F1max with α-shape and BORDER.
  3. Vary ε (or K) and c systematically on a disc example, plot F1max vs parameter to find optimal regime.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the BD-LLE algorithm perform on high-dimensional manifolds with complex boundary geometries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that BD-LLE "exhibits the best performance in vertical-cut torus and tilted-cut torus examples, regardless of the extrinsic geometry of the manifold and data distributions."
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests BD-LLE on simulated examples with low-dimensional manifolds (2D and 3D). It is unclear how the algorithm would perform on high-dimensional manifolds with more intricate boundary structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing BD-LLE on high-dimensional manifolds (e.g., 5D, 10D) with complex boundary geometries, such as those with sharp corners or multiple connected components, would provide insights into its scalability and robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can BD-LLE be extended to handle non-compact manifolds with boundary?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes the underlying manifold is compact, but many real-world data sets may not satisfy this assumption. The authors mention that "many approaches in manifold learning assume the underlying manifold of the data to be closed (compact and without boundary), which does not always align with realistic scenarios where the manifold may have boundaries."
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis and implementation of BD-LLE rely on the compactness of the manifold, which may not hold for non-compact manifolds. Extending the algorithm to handle non-compact manifolds would require addressing issues related to the behavior of the local covariance matrix and the boundary indicator at infinity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a modified version of BD-LLE that can handle non-compact manifolds and testing its performance on data sets that exhibit non-compact behavior (e.g., data distributed on a half-space or a cylinder) would provide insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of such an extension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does BD-LLE compare to other boundary detection algorithms when the data distribution is highly non-uniform?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "the BAND SPINVER, and LEVER are sensitive to the data distribution, and selecting appropriate thresholds becomes especially challenging when the data points are non-uniformly distributed."
- Why unresolved: While the paper compares BD-LLE to other algorithms in the presence of non-uniform data distributions, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how BD-LLE's performance varies with different levels of non-uniformity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where the data distribution is systematically varied from uniform to highly non-uniform, and comparing the performance of BD-LLE to other boundary detection algorithms across this spectrum, would provide insights into BD-LLE's robustness to non-uniformity.

## Limitations
- Theoretical claims about invariance to extrinsic curvature and non-uniform distribution are primarily supported by simulation rather than rigorous proofs
- Spectral analysis assumes sufficiently large sample sizes and well-separated eigenvalues, which may not hold in practical scenarios
- Parameter selection guidance is more explicit for ε-radius scheme than for KNN scheme

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mechanism by which BD-LLE computes barycentric coordinates from the local covariance matrix and derives the boundary indicator is mathematically sound and well-explained.
- **Medium Confidence**: The spectral analysis provides useful theoretical guidance for parameter selection, though practical applicability may vary with data characteristics.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim of superior performance across all manifold types and sampling distributions is based on limited simulations and may not generalize to all scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary ε and K across multiple orders of magnitude on synthetic manifolds to quantify the impact on detection accuracy and identify the parameter regimes where theoretical guidance holds.

2. **High-Dimensional Testing**: Evaluate BD-LLE on manifolds with dimension close to ambient space (e.g., d = p-1) to test the claim that other algorithms outperform when manifold dimension is high.

3. **Irregular Boundary Robustness**: Generate manifolds with highly irregular or fractal boundaries to assess the limitations of the bump function approximation and compare BD-LLE's performance against edge-detection based methods.
