# A Novel Bifurcation Method for Observation Perturbation Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Agents: Load Altering Attacks on a Cyber Physical Power System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05182
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05182
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel bifurcation attack method doubles adversarial regret for continuous control agents while maintaining stealth through constrained perturbations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel adversarial attack method for reinforcement learning agents in cyber-physical power systems, specifically targeting observation perturbations to manipulate agent behavior. The core contribution is the Grouped Difference Logit (GDL) loss with a bifurcation layer, which significantly increases attack impact while maintaining smaller distortions compared to traditional targeted attacks. The method was tested in a realistic smart energy environment using the CityLearn gym, demonstrating that carefully constrained adversarial observations can be statistically indistinguishable from normal data while still causing significant adversarial regret.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a bifurcation layer that transforms continuous regression outputs into logits compatible with classification-based adversarial attacks. This enables the use of Grouped Difference Logit (GDL) loss, which maximizes any logit in a target group rather than a specific label, increasing attack impact. The approach was tested against three white-box attack types (untargeted, optimally targeted, and bifurcation-enhanced) on continuous and discrete action space agents in the CityLearn environment, along with black-box Snooping attacks and various defense mechanisms.

## Key Results
- The bifurcation method doubled adversarial regret compared to state-of-the-art attacks for continuous control agents in CityLearn.
- Statistical analysis showed that adversarial observations with reduced budgets could evade Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) detection while still impacting power consumption.
- Discrete action space PPO agents were found to be significantly more robust to attacks than continuous action space agents, with up to 75% reduction in attack impact.
- The black-box Snooping attack was successfully enhanced using the bifurcation method, achieving comparable results to white-box attacks with historical data access.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Grouped Difference Logit (GDL) loss with bifurcation layer doubles adversarial regret for continuous control agents.
- Mechanism: GDL maximizes any logit in a target group rather than a single label, increasing attack impact without targeting a specific action. The bifurcation layer transforms a single continuous output into two logits (value and its negative), enabling GDL-compatible gradient optimization for regression networks.
- Core assumption: In control tasks, increasing the distance between the adversarial action and the original action proportionally increases adversarial regret.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "By implementing the Grouped Difference Logit (GDL) loss with a bifurcation layer, the adversarial regret for SotA attacks was doubled for continuous control agent in CityLearn." [section] "This Grouped DL (GDL) loss can be written as: GDL(x, y) = zy − max i∈G zi"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Constrained adversarial observations can be statistically indistinguishable from normal data while still causing significant adversarial regret.
- Mechanism: By reducing the adversarial budget (ϵ), perturbations are small enough to evade Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) detection while maintaining meaningful impact on agent behavior. Time-series analysis shows adversarial observations can have plausible individual feature values but distinct inter-observation variation patterns.
- Core assumption: MMD is effective for weak attacks but bypassed by stronger techniques, allowing stealthy attacks to exist within the "sweet spot" of small but impactful perturbations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "With a carefully selected budget, distributions of adversarial observations, which are not significantly different from the originals, cause a significant adversarial regret." [section] "Despite the adversarial observations being very close to the originals...the difference between two adversarial observations is greater than the originals."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Discrete action space PPO agents are significantly more robust to attacks than continuous action space agents.
- Mechanism: Discrete action spaces limit the adversary's ability to induce large behavioral changes with small perturbations, reducing the proportion of timesteps where the agent's decision is reversed.
- Core assumption: The distance between actions in discrete space corresponds to a meaningful behavioral difference, and smaller changes are less likely to cross action boundaries.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Discrete action space PPO agents were found to be significantly more robust to attacks than continuous action space agents, with up to 75% reduction in attack impact." [section] "The rate of (dis)charge reversal for the direct attack on the SAC was similar to the discrete PPO's value for the bifurcated attack."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) statistical test
  - Why needed here: MMD is used to determine if adversarial observations form a plausible distribution compared to original observations, serving as a metric for attack stealth.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean if the MMD value between adversarial and original observations is lower than the baseline distribution of clean data?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) action spaces
  - Why needed here: Understanding discrete vs continuous action spaces is crucial for analyzing attack robustness differences and implementing the bifurcation method.
  - Quick check question: How does the bifurcation method transform a continuous action space regressor into a form compatible with classification-based adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Adversarial examples in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The fundamental vulnerability being exploited is that small, carefully crafted perturbations to inputs can cause significant changes in neural network outputs.
  - Quick check question: Why are adversarial examples difficult to detect when properly regularized, and how does this property enable stealthy attacks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CityLearn gym environment -> DRL agents (PPO/SAC) -> Adversarial attack modules (ACG, BB, PGD with bifurcation) -> Detection modules (MMD test, time-series analysis) -> Defense modules (ATLA training, discrete action space conversion)
- Critical path: Environment generates observations → Agent selects actions → Attack module crafts adversarial observations → Agent receives perturbed observations → Performance metrics and detection analysis are computed
- Design tradeoffs: Higher adversarial budget increases attack impact but reduces stealth; discrete action spaces increase robustness but may limit control precision; ATLA training increases robustness but may reduce clean performance
- Failure signatures: Attack failure when MMD detection identifies adversarial observations; defense failure when adversarial regret remains high despite robustness measures; bifurcation method failure when continuous outputs cannot be meaningfully grouped
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement PGD attack on continuous PPO agent without bifurcation layer to establish baseline adversarial regret.
  2. Add bifurcation layer to same agent and re-run PGD attack to verify doubled adversarial regret.
  3. Run MMD test on adversarial observations from experiment 2 with varying ϵ values to find stealth threshold.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can individual adversarial observations be detected in a time series, beyond aggregate statistical methods?
  - Basis in paper: The paper found that while adversarial observations were statistically indistinguishable from originals using MMD tests, the absolute differences between sequential observations were significantly larger for adversarial data, suggesting individual detection might be possible.
  - Why unresolved: The paper identified this as a promising direction but didn't develop or test specific methods for detecting individual adversarial observations.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of detection algorithms that can identify individual adversarial observations with high confidence and low false-positive rates.

- Question: What is the minimum number of adversarial observations required to cause significant load altering attacks on power grids?
  - Basis in paper: The paper notes that CityLearn doesn't model wider power grid loads, making it impossible to determine how many adversarial observations would be needed for grid-disrupting attacks.
  - Why unresolved: The simulation environment lacks modeling of broader grid impacts and cascading failures.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Testing in a power grid simulation that includes load distribution, grid capacity, and cascading failure modeling to quantify attack thresholds.

- Question: How do changing environmental patterns (weather, electricity demand) affect the reliability of adversarial observation detection over time?
  - Basis in paper: The paper notes that seasonal changes in weather features and electricity use, as well as shifting patterns from EV adoption, could cause drift that increases MMD and complicates detection.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only tested detection on static historical data without considering temporal drift or changing patterns.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies comparing detection accuracy across different seasons, years, and evolving consumption patterns.

## Limitations

- The bifurcation method's performance on different regression architectures beyond the tested ACG and PGD attacks remains unverified.
- Stealth findings rely primarily on MMD detection, which may not capture all detection methods and could be vulnerable to more sophisticated approaches.
- The simulation environment lacks modeling of broader power grid impacts and cascading failures, limiting real-world applicability.

## Confidence

- Doubling of adversarial regret through bifurcation method: High confidence
- Stealth capability through MMD evasion: Medium confidence
- Robustness advantage of discrete action spaces: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Test the bifurcation method across diverse regression architectures and control tasks beyond the CityLearn environment to assess generalizability of the doubled adversarial regret claim.

2. Evaluate attack stealth under alternative detection methods including reconstruction-based approaches and adversarial example detectors to validate MMD-based findings.

3. Compare the robustness advantage of discrete action spaces against other defense mechanisms like adversarial training and input preprocessing to contextualize the reported 75% reduction in attack impact.
