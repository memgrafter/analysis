# SciKnowEval: Evaluating Multi-level Scientific Knowledge of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09098
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SciKnowEval benchmark evaluates 20 LLMs across five progressive scientific knowledge levels, showing proprietary and reasoning models outperform open-source models, especially in memory and reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
SciKnowEval is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate multi-level scientific knowledge in large language models across biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science. The benchmark spans five progressive levels—memory, comprehension, reasoning, discernment, and application—totaling 28K questions across 58 tasks. Evaluation of 20 LLMs reveals that proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4.1, o4-mini) and large reasoning models achieve the highest overall scores, particularly in memory and reasoning tasks, while open-source scientific LLMs lag behind. The benchmark highlights significant challenges in scientific reasoning, safety discernment, and real-world application, indicating areas requiring further advancement in scientific LLMs.

## Method Summary
The benchmark employs a zero-shot evaluation protocol with standardized inference parameters (temperature=0.0, top-p=1.0, max-length=4096) across 20 LLMs including proprietary, open-source general-purpose, and scientific models. The SciKnowEval dataset comprises 28K questions across 58 tasks from four scientific domains, categorized into five progressive cognitive levels. Evaluation uses accuracy for multiple-choice questions, F1-score for relation extraction, and normalized scores (0-1) for generative questions. Scoring for generative tasks utilizes GPT-4o as an evaluator, though this introduces cost considerations for large-scale assessment.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models (GPT-4.1, o4-mini) and large reasoning models achieve highest overall scores, especially in memory and reasoning tasks
- Open-source scientific LLMs underperform compared to larger general-purpose models despite domain specialization
- All models struggle with L4 (safety discernment) and L5 (application) tasks, indicating limitations in scientific reasoning and practical implementation
- Model performance shows clear stratification across the five progressive levels, with accuracy decreasing at each ascending level

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark evaluates LLMs across five progressive levels that mirror human learning stages, enabling targeted assessment of knowledge depth.
- Mechanism: By structuring questions into memory, comprehension, reasoning, discernment, and application levels, the benchmark isolates and measures distinct cognitive capabilities, revealing where models excel or fail.
- Core assumption: Scientific understanding can be decomposed into these five discrete cognitive stages, each requiring different model capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "across five progressive levels of scientific understanding: memory, comprehension, reasoning, discernment, and application"
  - [section] "Building upon the above design philosophy, we develop the SciKnowEval dataset specifically tailored for assessing multi-level scientific knowledge in LLMs"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly discuss multi-level benchmarking approaches
- Break condition: If scientific knowledge acquisition doesn't follow discrete progressive stages or if models can bypass these stages through other mechanisms

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Large reasoning models achieve superior performance by generating hidden chain-of-thoughts during inference, enabling better scientific computation and reasoning.
- Mechanism: LRMs integrate deliberative reasoning processes that allow step-by-step problem solving, particularly effective for complex scientific calculations and logical deductions.
- Core assumption: The reasoning capability gap between standard and reasoning LLMs is primarily due to the presence of explicit deliberative processes rather than knowledge depth
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4.1, o4-mini) and large reasoning models achieve the highest overall scores, especially in memory and reasoning tasks"
  - [section] "LRMs deliver outstanding results and even surpass human experts in PhD-level scientific Q&A sessions"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't specifically discuss reasoning model advantages in scientific domains
- Break condition: If reasoning advantages diminish when models face tasks requiring factual knowledge over deliberative reasoning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Proprietary models outperform open-source models due to larger parameter capacity enabling more comprehensive knowledge retention and better generalization.
- Mechanism: Larger models can store more scientific facts and relationships, leading to superior performance across all benchmark levels, particularly in knowledge memory and comprehension.
- Core assumption: Model size directly correlates with scientific knowledge capacity and performance on factual recall tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4.1, o4-mini) and large reasoning models achieve the highest overall scores"
  - [section] "Open-source LLMs with larger scales, including DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ-32B, also exhibit comparable performance"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss size-performance relationships in scientific LLMs
- Break condition: If fine-tuned smaller models or specialized scientific models can outperform larger general-purpose models on domain-specific tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-level cognitive assessment framework
  - Why needed here: Scientific knowledge requires different cognitive abilities at different depths, and a single-level benchmark cannot capture this complexity
  - Quick check question: Can a model that excels at memory tasks necessarily perform well on reasoning tasks, or do these require distinct capabilities?

- Concept: Deliberative reasoning processes
  - Why needed here: Scientific problem-solving often requires step-by-step logical deduction rather than pattern matching, making reasoning processes crucial for accurate answers
  - Quick check question: How does the presence of chain-of-thought reasoning in LRMs improve performance on tasks requiring multi-step scientific calculations?

- Concept: Domain-specific knowledge integration
  - Why needed here: Scientific domains have unique terminology, relationships, and reasoning patterns that general models may not capture without specialized training
  - Quick check question: Why do scientific LLMs that are fine-tuned on domain data not always outperform larger general-purpose models on scientific benchmarks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection pipeline (literature extraction → QA generation → refactoring → database transformation) → Multi-level task categorization → Model evaluation → Scoring system
- Critical path: Question generation → Quality control → Domain categorization → Level assignment → Model inference → Automated scoring
- Design tradeoffs: Large dataset scale vs. evaluation cost, comprehensive multi-level assessment vs. model inference complexity, proprietary model access vs. open-source reproducibility
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on reasoning tasks despite high memory scores, inability to reject harmful scientific questions, failure to generate practical experimental protocols
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline proprietary models on single-level subsets to identify which levels show the largest performance gaps
  2. Compare reasoning vs. non-reasoning models on L3 tasks to quantify the reasoning advantage
  3. Test smaller scientific LLMs against larger general-purpose models on domain-specific tasks to validate the size vs. specialization tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design a more efficient and cost-effective evaluation method for the SciKnowEval benchmark that doesn't rely on GPT-4o as the scorer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the large scale of the SciKnowEval dataset and the involvement of some tasks requiring scoring based on GPT-4o introduce costs. It suggests future work should optimize assessment methods by potentially substituting GPT-4o with an open-source scientific LLM evaluator.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the cost issue but doesn't propose or test alternative evaluation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a reliable open-source scientific LLM evaluator that matches GPT-4o's scoring accuracy for generation tasks at lower computational cost.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific training strategies or data augmentations would most effectively improve scientific LLMs' performance on the L3 (knowledge reasoning) and L5 (knowledge application) levels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with tasks related to scientific reasoning and application, indicating these remain challenging areas requiring further improvement.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies these as problem areas, it doesn't explore what specific interventions could address these weaknesses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different training approaches (e.g., targeted reasoning datasets, reinforcement learning with scientific reasoning rewards, multi-task training strategies) and their impact on L3 and L5 performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we improve the safety discernment capabilities of scientific LLMs, particularly for molecular toxicity prediction and harmful question refusal?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The L4 level results show that most models struggle with safety discernment, with only a few exceeding 60% accuracy in molecular toxicity prediction and many failing to appropriately refuse harmful questions.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies limitations in current safety alignment approaches but doesn't propose solutions for improving safety discernment in scientific contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of specialized safety training datasets for scientific contexts, testing of deliberative alignment techniques specifically for scientific safety concerns, and evaluation of safety improvements across the benchmark's L4 tasks.

## Limitations

- The benchmark's five-level structure may not fully capture nuanced differences between comprehension and reasoning in scientific contexts
- Zero-shot evaluation protocol may not reflect real-world usage where models benefit from few-shot examples or task-specific prompting
- Focus on four scientific domains leaves gaps in emerging fields like computational biology or quantum materials science

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Proprietary models and LRMs consistently outperform open-source models across all five levels, particularly in memory and reasoning tasks
- The five-level progressive structure effectively stratifies model capabilities, with clear performance drops at each ascending level

**Medium Confidence:**
- The claim that LRMs' superiority stems primarily from hidden chain-of-thought reasoning rather than knowledge depth is plausible but not definitively proven
- The assertion that larger parameter capacity directly enables better scientific knowledge retention is supported by the data but doesn't account for potential efficiency gains from specialized fine-tuning

**Low Confidence:**
- The benchmark's ability to fully capture real-world scientific application capabilities is questionable, as the "application" level tasks may not encompass the full complexity of practical scientific problem-solving

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Transfer Validation**: Test whether models that excel at memory and comprehension in one domain (e.g., biology) maintain similar performance in unfamiliar domains (e.g., materials science) to validate the knowledge generalization assumption.

2. **Reasoning Process Isolation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing LRMs with and without chain-of-thought prompting on the same reasoning tasks to quantify the specific contribution of deliberative processes versus knowledge depth.

3. **Fine-tuning Impact Assessment**: Fine-tune a medium-sized open-source model on the SciKnowEval training data (if available) and re-evaluate to determine whether specialized training can close the performance gap with larger proprietary models, challenging the size-based advantage assumption.
