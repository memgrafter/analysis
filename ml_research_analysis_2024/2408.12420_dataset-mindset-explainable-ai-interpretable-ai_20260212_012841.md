## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12420

- Primary result: XAI is a subset of IAI; XAI focuses on post-hoc analysis while IAI requires a priori mindset of abstraction

## Executive Summary
This paper clarifies the distinction between explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable AI (IAI), arguing that XAI is a subset of IAI. XAI focuses on post-hoc analysis of datasets, while IAI requires an a priori mindset for understanding and satisfaction. The authors demonstrate this through empirical experiments on a car insurance dataset, employing various XAI techniques and optimizing ML models via hyperparameter search using HPC. The study shows that many high-level abstraction decisions are needed during XAI experiments, driven by the mindset of the researcher.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted empirical experiments using a car insurance claims dataset (10,000 observations, 19 features) from Kaggle. They trained baseline ML models (GLM, RF, GBM) and optimized GBM via hyperparameter search using HPC/cloud computing (576 grid points). XAI techniques including LIME, PDP, ICE, Shapley, ALE, VI, Anchors, and Fairness were applied post-hoc to explain the optimized GBM model. The study focused on both global and local explanations, feature correlations, and the role of researcher mindset in guiding XAI processes.

## Key Results
- XAI techniques reveal clear feature importance patterns in car insurance claims data
- Hyperparameter optimization improves model performance across different ML algorithms
- Many high-level abstraction decisions are required during XAI experiments, driven by researcher mindset
- The proposed 3x3 matrix framework organizes XAI criteria across data, modeling, and explanation phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The distinction between XAI and IAI is operationalized by outward vs inward reasoning. Outward reasoning focuses on making sense of data through natural laws and algorithms, while inward reasoning seeks justification and satisfaction guided by ethics, intuition, and belief. Core assumption: Researchers' decision-making during XAI experiments is influenced by their underlying mindset, which aligns with either outward (data-driven) or inward (satisfaction-driven) reasoning. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "When directed outwards, we want the reasons to make sense through the laws of nature. When turned inwards, we want the reasons to be happy, guided by the laws of the heart."

### Mechanism 2
IAI provides the high-level abstraction framework that guides XAI experimental design. IAI mindset determines critical choices like data imputation strategy, feature selection, and model optimization, which are prerequisites for meaningful XAI. Core assumption: XAI techniques cannot be applied in isolation; they require IAI-driven decisions about problem framing and validation criteria. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "While XAI and IAI share reason as the common notion for the goal of transparency, clarity, fairness, reliability, and accountability in the context of ethical AI and trustworthy AI (TAI), their differences lie in that XAI emphasizes the post-hoc analysis of a dataset, and IAI requires a priori mindset of abstraction."

### Mechanism 3
The 3x3 matrix provides a meta-hyperparameter framework for XAI criteria. The matrix maps decisions across data processing, ML modeling, and explanation phases, multiplied by problem context, hypothesis, and validation/justification spaces. Core assumption: XAI experiments involve multiple decision points that can be systematically organized and searched through this matrix framework. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We propose a 3X3 high-level abstraction matrix for the meta-hyperparameter concept to define XAI's criteria from data to ML modelling and from ML modelling to XAI across problems, hypothesis and validation/justification spaces."

## Foundational Learning

- **Duality of reasoning (outward vs inward)**: Why needed - This is the fundamental distinction that separates XAI from IAI and explains why they cannot be used interchangeably. Quick check: When deciding whether to impute missing data or drop it, are you reasoning about what makes sense for the data (outward) or what feels ethically right (inward)?
- **Post-hoc vs a priori analysis**: Why needed - XAI operates on post-hoc analysis of datasets, while IAI requires a priori mindset of abstraction before data analysis begins. Quick check: Does your current XAI experiment require you to first establish satisfaction criteria before choosing techniques, or are you applying techniques after model training?
- **Meta-hyperparameter search**: Why needed - The 3x3 matrix represents a higher-level search space that encompasses both data/model decisions and explanation technique selection. Quick check: When selecting an XAI technique, are you considering only technical compatibility or also problem context and validation criteria?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data processing pipeline → ML model training → XAI technique application → IAI validation; 3x3 matrix framework (Data × Problem, ML × Hypothesis, Explanation × Validation); HPC/cloud infrastructure for hyperparameter optimization
- **Critical path**: 1) Dataset preparation and imputation decision (IAI phase); 2) Model selection and hyperparameter optimization (IAI phase); 3) XAI technique application based on model characteristics (XAI phase); 4) IAI validation of explanations against satisfaction criteria (IAI phase)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Dataset size vs. computational cost for hyperparameter search; Number of XAI techniques vs. interpretability clarity; Model complexity vs. explainability capability
- **Failure signatures**: Unstable VI rankings indicating correlated features; ROC curves near diagonal indicating poor prediction capability; Low anchor coverage despite high precision
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement LIME on a small subset to verify local explanations work; 2) Run PDP plots for top 2 features to check for non-linearity; 3) Execute ALE comparison to validate PDP results for correlated features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we interpret explainable results when using global intrinsic approaches for explanation? Is there a Gestalt shift for intrinsic approaches? Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention they are unable to test deep neural networks-related XAI tools, such as LRP and DTD, as well as causal methods for XAI, and question how to interpret explainable results with global intrinsic approaches. Why unresolved: The paper focuses on post-hoc XAI techniques and does not explore global intrinsic models like LRP and DTD, which are designed for neural networks. What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing global intrinsic approaches (LRP, DTD) with post-hoc methods on the same datasets, analyzing interpretability differences.

### Open Question 2
How can we generate high-level abstraction for a meta-hyperparameter search across data, modeling, and explanation phases? Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a 3x3 matrix for meta-hyperparameter search but do not detail how to implement it or what evidence would validate its effectiveness. Why unresolved: The concept is introduced but lacks concrete methodology or empirical validation for automating meta-hyperparameter decisions. What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study showing improved XAI outcomes using the proposed meta-hyperparameter framework compared to standard approaches.

### Open Question 3
How do other XAI techniques impact the interpretable AI (IAI) process, particularly in defining the criteria for satisfaction? Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest future work exploring other XAI techniques to understand their impact on IAI, indicating that the relationship between XAI methods and IAI satisfaction is not fully understood. Why unresolved: The study primarily uses a limited set of XAI techniques and does not explore the broader impact of different methods on IAI criteria. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of multiple XAI techniques' influence on IAI satisfaction criteria across diverse datasets and problem contexts.

## Limitations

- Study relies on a single car insurance dataset with modest sample size (10,000 observations)
- 3x3 matrix framework lacks quantitative validation and comparative metrics
- Outward/inward reasoning distinction is philosophically interesting but subjective and introduces researcher bias

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: XAI techniques can be applied to the car insurance dataset (empirical results show clear patterns in feature importance and partial dependence)
- **Medium confidence**: The outward/inward reasoning framework provides useful distinctions for XAI vs IAI (based on qualitative reasoning and single case study)
- **Low confidence**: The 3x3 matrix represents a practical meta-hyperparameter framework (no comparative validation or quantitative metrics provided)

## Next Checks

1. Test the 3x3 matrix framework across multiple datasets and problem domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing XAI results from researcher-driven vs algorithm-driven decisions to validate the inward/outward distinction
3. Apply the framework to a dataset with known ground truth explanations to measure whether IAI-guided XAI produces more accurate or useful interpretations
