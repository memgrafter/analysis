# Centrality Graph Shift Operators for Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.04655
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04655
- **Reference count**: 40
- **One-line primary result**: Introduces Centrality Graph Shift Operators (CGSOs) that normalize adjacency matrices using global centrality metrics like PageRank, k-core, or walk counts, improving GNN performance on multiple benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Centrality Graph Shift Operators (CGSOs), a novel family of graph operators that normalize adjacency matrices using global centrality metrics like PageRank, k-core, or walk counts instead of traditional local degree-based normalization. The authors provide theoretical analysis of CGSO spectral properties and validate their effectiveness through spectral clustering experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs. They also integrate CGSOs into Graph Neural Networks, demonstrating improved performance on multiple benchmark datasets compared to standard GNNs using traditional graph shift operators.

## Method Summary
The CGSO is defined as Φ(A, V) = m1Ve1 + m2Ve2Ave3 + m3IN, where V is a diagonal matrix of global centrality scores (PageRank, k-core, or walk counts), and the parameters m1, m2, m3, e1, e2, e3, and a are learnable. The method replaces traditional degree-based normalization in GNNs, preserving computational efficiency through sparse matrix operations while incorporating global structural information. The approach is validated on spectral clustering tasks and node classification benchmarks, comparing performance against standard GSOs and demonstrating improved accuracy across multiple datasets.

## Key Results
- CGSOs improve spectral clustering performance on synthetic graphs and real-world datasets, outperforming traditional degree-based normalization
- Integrating CGSOs into GCN and GATv2 architectures yields improved node classification accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets including Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, and others
- The proposed method enhances GNNs by incorporating global structural information while preserving computational efficiency through sparse matrix operations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CGSOs capture global structural information by normalizing adjacency matrices using global centrality metrics like PageRank, k-core, or walk counts instead of local degree-based normalization.
- Mechanism: The normalization matrix V⁻¹A replaces the traditional D⁻¹A or similar local normalization, where V is a diagonal matrix containing global centrality scores (e.g., PageRank scores, k-core numbers, or walk counts). This transformation preserves the sparsity pattern of the adjacency matrix while incorporating global structural information.
- Core assumption: Global centrality metrics capture meaningful structural information that is complementary to local degree information and can improve graph representation learning tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Traditional GSOs are typically constructed by normalizing the adjacency matrix by the degree matrix, a local centrality metric. In this work, we instead propose and study Centrality GSOs (CGSOs), which normalize adjacency matrices by global centrality metrics such as the PageRank, k-core or count of fixed length walks."
  - [section 3.1] "We consider three global centrality metrics, in addition to the local node degree. We recall the definitions of these global centrality metrics now."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus papers about global centrality normalization

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CGSOs maintain computational efficiency while incorporating global information by preserving the sparsity pattern of the original adjacency matrix.
- Mechanism: Since V is a diagonal matrix and A is sparse, the product V⁻¹A maintains the same sparsity pattern as A, allowing efficient matrix operations and preserving the computational complexity of standard GNNs.
- Core assumption: The sparsity pattern of the adjacency matrix is crucial for computational efficiency in graph neural networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our CGSOs introduce global information into the graph representation without altering the connectivity pattern encoded in the original GSO and therefore, maintain the sparsity of the adjacency matrix."
  - [section 5] "Since our CGSOs preserve the sparsity pattern of the original adjacency matrix, the complexity of the GNNs in which the CGSOs are inserted is unaltered."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence about sparsity preservation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CGSOs can be effectively integrated into existing GNN architectures by replacing the traditional message passing operator without changing the overall architecture.
- Mechanism: The proposed CGSO Φ(A, V) = m1Ve1 + m2Ve2Ave3 + m3IN can replace the traditional GSO in the message passing equation M(ℓ+1) = Φ(A)H(ℓ), where the learnable parameters allow the model to adapt the CGSO to the specific dataset and task.
- Core assumption: The GNN architecture can accommodate different types of GSOs in the message passing step without requiring architectural modifications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We furthermore outline how our CGSO can act as the message passing operator in any Graph Neural Network and in particular demonstrate strong performance of a variant of the Graph Convolutional Network and Graph Attention Network using our CGSOs on several real-world benchmark datasets."
  - [section 3.2] "Incorporating CGSOs within GNNs aims to harness structural information, enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle topological patterns for prediction tasks."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence about integration into specific GNN architectures

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Graph G = (V, E) and node feature matrix X -> Centrality computation module -> CGSO construction -> GNN backbone (GCN, GATv2) -> Output node representations

- Critical path:
  1. Compute global centrality metrics for all nodes
  2. Construct the diagonal centrality matrix V
  3. Compute the CGSO Φ(A, V) = m1Ve1 + m2Ve2Ave3 + m3IN
  4. Use the CGSO in the message passing equation of the GNN
  5. Train the GNN with standard backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. complexity: Using multiple centrality metrics and learnable parameters increases flexibility but also increases the number of hyperparameters
  - Global vs. local information: CGSOs incorporate global structural information but may be less effective for tasks that primarily require local information
  - Pre-computation cost: Computing global centrality metrics adds pre-processing overhead but can be amortized over multiple training epochs

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets where local information is more important than global structure
  - Numerical instability due to very small or very large values in the diagonal centrality matrix
  - Convergence issues if the learnable parameters in the CGSO formulation do not adapt properly

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace the standard GSO in a simple GCN with a CGSO using degree centrality and compare performance on a standard benchmark dataset
  2. Implement a CGSO using PageRank centrality and test it on a dataset known to have important global structure (e.g., citation networks)
  3. Combine local (degree) and global (k-core) centrality CGSOs in a single GNN and evaluate on a heterophilic dataset to test the benefit of incorporating both types of information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- The optimal combination strategy for local and global centrality metrics in CGNNs is not systematically explored
- The theoretical analysis of CGSO spectral properties and their impact on graph clustering is preliminary
- The scalability of CGSOs on large-scale graphs and the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains is not fully evaluated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic definition and construction of CGSOs using global centrality metrics (degree, PageRank, k-core, walk counts) is well-defined and theoretically grounded.
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical results showing improved performance of CGSOs on benchmark datasets are convincing, but the generalizability to other datasets and tasks needs further validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The theoretical analysis of the spectral properties of CGSOs and their impact on graph clustering is preliminary and requires more rigorous investigation.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct a comprehensive ablation study to isolate the impact of each centrality metric (PageRank, k-core, walk counts) on GNN performance across diverse graph datasets, including heterophilic and homophilic graphs.

2. **Theoretical Analysis**: Rigorously analyze the spectral properties of CGSOs under different centrality metrics and graph structures to understand their impact on graph clustering and representation learning.

3. **Scalability Evaluation**: Evaluate the scalability of CGSOs on large-scale graphs and assess the trade-off between the computational cost of computing global centrality metrics and the potential performance gains in GNNs.
