# Diffusion-based Unsupervised Audio-visual Speech Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05301
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05301
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AV-UDiffSE+ achieves 10.21 dB SI-SDR, 3.26 PESQ, and 0.74 ESTOI in matched condition; 3.67 dB SI-SDR, 2.42 PESQ, and 0.61 ESTOI in mismatched condition

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a diffusion-based unsupervised audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) framework that combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model. The method pre-trains a diffusion model on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data, then iteratively estimates clean speech by combining it with the NMF noise model using posterior sampling. A faster inference algorithm, UDiffSE+, reduces the number of iterations needed compared to the previous approach. Experimental results show that the proposed AVSE approach outperforms its audio-only counterpart and generalizes better than a recent supervised-generative AVSE method.

## Method Summary
The method involves pre-training a diffusion model on clean speech conditioned on visual embeddings from corresponding video data. During inference, the framework iteratively estimates clean speech by combining the diffusion model's speech prior with an NMF-based noise model using posterior sampling. The UDiffSE+ algorithm improves inference speed by using a single round of reverse diffusion with immediate noise parameter updates after each step, rather than completing full cycles. The framework uses frozen visual features from AV-HuBERT and a score network with cross-attention to integrate visual and audio information.

## Key Results
- AV-UDiffSE+ achieves 10.21 dB SI-SDR, 3.26 PESQ, and 0.74 ESTOI in matched condition
- Outperforms audio-only counterpart in all metrics across conditions
- Generalizes better than recent supervised-generative AVSE method in mismatched conditions
- UDiffSE+ algorithm provides better speed-performance tradeoff than previous diffusion-based method

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diffusion models trained on clean speech conditioned on video embeddings can act as a strong prior for audio-visual speech enhancement.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model learns the distribution of clean speech conditioned on visual features (lip movements). During inference, reverse diffusion guided by both the noisy audio and visual embeddings generates enhanced speech iteratively.
- Core assumption: Visual embeddings capture sufficient lip movement information to condition the clean speech distribution effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution"
  - [section] "We model the conditional speech generative distribution p(s|v), where v denotes a visual embedding associated with s"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on audio-visual separation but not specifically on diffusion-based priors
- Break condition: If visual embeddings don't capture lip movements well, the conditional distribution becomes uninformative, degrading enhancement performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining diffusion-based speech priors with NMF-based noise models enables unsupervised speech enhancement without clean-noisy speech pairs.
- Mechanism: The pre-trained diffusion model serves as the speech prior, while NMF models background noise. An EM-like iterative process alternates between sampling from the posterior (using diffusion) and updating noise parameters.
- Core assumption: NMF can adequately model diverse noise types as non-negative low-rank matrices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model"
  - [section] "The additive noise is modeled as n ∼ NC(0, diag(mϕ)), where mϕ = vec(WH), with W, H being low-rank matrices with non-negative entries"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work uses NMF for noise modeling in unsupervised settings
- Break condition: If noise doesn't fit the NMF low-rank assumption, parameter updates become inaccurate, limiting enhancement quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed UDiffSE+ algorithm significantly reduces inference time while maintaining performance by avoiding full reverse diffusion cycles.
- Mechanism: Instead of completing full reverse diffusion for each E-step, UDiffSE+ uses Tweedie's formula to estimate clean speech after each diffusion step, then updates noise parameters immediately.
- Core assumption: Single-step estimates are sufficiently accurate to guide noise parameter updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method"
  - [section] "We introduce a significantly more efficient methodology named UDiffSE+, which requires only one round of reverse diffusion"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly comparable fast diffusion inference methods in related work
- Break condition: If single-step estimates are too noisy, the alternating updates may diverge or converge slowly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and score matching
  - Why needed here: The entire enhancement framework relies on learning and sampling from a diffusion model conditioned on visual features
  - Quick check question: What does the score function ∇st log pt(st) represent in diffusion models?

- Concept: Non-negative matrix factorization for noise modeling
  - Why needed here: NMF provides the noise model that pairs with the diffusion speech prior for unsupervised enhancement
  - Quick check question: How do the multiplicative update rules for NMF ensure non-negativity of W and H?

- Concept: Cross-attention for multimodal fusion
  - Why needed here: Visual features must be effectively integrated with audio features in the score network
  - Quick check question: In the cross-attention mechanism, what serves as queries versus keys/values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Visual feature extractor (frozen AV-HuBERT) -> Score network (NCSN++M with cross-attention) -> Reverse diffusion -> Posterior sampling -> NMF noise model updates

- Critical path: Visual features → Score network → Reverse diffusion → Posterior sampling → Noise parameter updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using frozen visual features vs. training end-to-end: Faster training, less flexibility
  - Single attention head vs. multiple: Simpler, less computationally expensive
  - NMF rank selection: Higher rank captures more noise variation but risks overfitting

- Failure signatures:
  - Visual features too noisy → Poor conditioning, degraded enhancement
  - NMF rank too low → Insufficient noise modeling capacity
  - Inference step size too large → Numerical instability in reverse diffusion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train audio-only diffusion model (no visual conditioning) and verify it learns clean speech distribution
  2. Test visual feature quality by measuring lip-sync accuracy on validation set
  3. Compare enhancement performance with different NMF ranks (e.g., 5, 10, 20) on matched condition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the performance of the AV-UDiffSE+ framework compare to other state-of-the-art audio-visual speech enhancement methods in terms of subjective quality metrics?
- Can the AV-UDiffSE+ framework be extended to handle more complex noise scenarios, such as non-stationary or non-additive noise?
- How does the AV-UDiffSE+ framework perform in real-time applications, considering the computational cost of the diffusion-based approach?

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of visual conditioning depends heavily on the quality of frozen AV-HuBERT visual features, which may not capture all relevant lip movement information
- The NMF noise model assumes background noise can be well-approximated by non-negative low-rank matrices, which may not hold for complex or non-stationary noise types
- The UDiffSE+ algorithm, while faster, sacrifices some performance compared to full reverse diffusion cycles, suggesting a potential tradeoff between speed and quality

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core mechanism of combining diffusion-based speech priors with NMF noise models for unsupervised AVSE is well-supported by the experimental results, showing consistent improvements over audio-only baselines and better generalization than supervised methods in mismatched conditions.

**Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the UDiffSE+ algorithm's speed-accuracy tradeoff is demonstrated but could benefit from more extensive ablation studies across different noise types and signal-to-noise ratios to fully characterize its performance envelope.

**Medium confidence**: The generalization performance in mismatched conditions (LRS3 + NTCD-TIMIT) is promising but limited by the relatively small test set size, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about real-world applicability.

## Next Checks

1. **Visual feature sensitivity analysis**: Systematically evaluate enhancement performance using visual features extracted from different layers of the AV-HuBERT model to determine the optimal feature representation for speech enhancement.

2. **Noise model robustness testing**: Test the NMF noise model's performance on non-stationary noise types (e.g., babble, music) that may not conform to the low-rank assumption, comparing against alternative noise modeling approaches.

3. **Cross-attention architecture ablation**: Conduct controlled experiments varying the number of attention heads and cross-attention layers in the score network to quantify their impact on enhancement quality and computational efficiency.
