core_contribution: This paper studies fair regression under demographic parity within
  the unawareness framework where the sensitive attribute cannot be directly used
  in predictions. The authors characterize the optimal fair regression function as
  the solution to a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs, extending previous

# Demographic parity in regression and classification within the unawareness framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.02471
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02471
- Reference count: 21
- The paper characterizes optimal fair regression under demographic parity in the unawareness framework as a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates fair regression under demographic parity constraints when sensitive attributes cannot be directly used for predictions (unawareness framework). The authors establish that the optimal fair regression function can be characterized as the solution to a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs, extending previous results from the awareness framework. A key finding is that this optimal fair regression function does not preserve order, contrasting with the behavior in the awareness case. The paper also bridges fair regression and fair classification by showing that under a nestedness condition on classifiers, the optimal fair regression function can be recovered by thresholding the family of optimal fair classifiers.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes theoretical foundations for fair regression under demographic parity within the unawareness framework. The authors characterize the optimal fair regression function as a solution to a barycenter problem using optimal transport costs, which represents a significant extension of previous work that focused on the awareness framework. They prove that this fair regression function does not preserve the ordering of predictions, unlike in the awareness case. The theoretical framework connects fair regression and fair classification through a nestedness condition on classifiers, demonstrating that when this condition holds, the optimal fair regression function can be obtained by thresholding the family of optimal fair classifiers. The nestedness condition is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for this equivalence between the two problems.

## Key Results
- Optimal fair regression under demographic parity in the unawareness framework is characterized as a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs
- The optimal fair regression function does not preserve order, unlike in the awareness case
- Under nestedness conditions on classifiers, optimal fair regression can be recovered by thresholding the family of optimal fair classifiers
- The nestedness condition is both necessary and sufficient for the equivalence between fair regression and fair classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on optimal transport theory to characterize fair regression as a barycenter problem. When sensitive attributes are unavailable, the fair regression function must minimize transport costs between conditional distributions across groups while maintaining demographic parity. The nestedness condition creates a hierarchical structure among classifiers that enables the regression function to be expressed as a thresholded combination of these classifiers.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal transport costs - Used to measure discrepancies between conditional distributions across groups; quick check: verify properties of transport cost functions
- Barycenter problems - Framework for finding a central distribution between multiple distributions; quick check: confirm existence and uniqueness of barycenters
- Demographic parity - Fairness criterion requiring equal outcomes across groups; quick check: verify that proposed solution satisfies demographic parity
- Nestedness conditions - Hierarchical structure among classifiers; quick check: test whether classifiers form a nested sequence

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Fair regression function <- Barycenter problem <- Optimal transport costs <- Group conditional distributions

Critical path: Input features → Group conditional distributions → Optimal transport formulation → Barycenter optimization → Fair regression output

Design tradeoffs: The optimal transport-based approach provides a principled theoretical framework but may face computational challenges in high dimensions compared to simpler heuristic methods.

Failure signatures: Violation of nestedness condition breaks the equivalence between regression and classification; high-dimensional settings may make optimal transport computation intractable.

First experiments:
1. Verify that the proposed fair regression function satisfies demographic parity constraints
2. Test the nestedness condition on synthetic datasets with known ground truth
3. Compare the ordering preservation properties of fair regression in awareness vs. unawareness frameworks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The nestedness assumption may be restrictive and limit practical applicability
- The unawareness framework may not capture real-world scenarios where partial sensitive attribute information exists
- Optimal transport computations may be computationally challenging in high-dimensional settings
- The theoretical framework focuses specifically on demographic parity, limiting generalizability to other fairness notions

## Confidence
High - The paper provides rigorous mathematical proofs for its theoretical claims, and the connection between fair regression and classification under nestedness is clearly established.

Medium - The practical implications and computational feasibility of the proposed methods need further exploration, particularly in high-dimensional settings.

Medium - The nestedness condition, while theoretically elegant, may be too restrictive for many practical applications.

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation of the nestedness condition on real-world datasets to assess how commonly it holds in practice and what happens when it is violated
2. Computational complexity analysis of the optimal transport-based fair regression method, particularly for high-dimensional feature spaces
3. Extension of the theoretical framework to other fairness notions beyond demographic parity to test the generalizability of the results
