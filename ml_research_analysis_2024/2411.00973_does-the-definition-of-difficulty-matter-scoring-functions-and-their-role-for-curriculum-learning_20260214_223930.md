# Does the Definition of Difficulty Matter? Scoring Functions and their Role for Curriculum Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00973
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00973
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Robust scoring functions for curriculum learning correlate with better performance, and different CL strategies produce complementary model behaviors that benefit from late fusion.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how different definitions of sample difficulty affect curriculum learning (CL) performance. The authors evaluate six scoring functions (SFs) for estimating difficulty on CIFAR-10 and DCASE2020 datasets, measuring their robustness across model architectures, optimizers, and random seeds. They find that while SFs generally agree on difficulty orderings, robustness to randomness varies significantly. Ensemble scoring improves robustness, and more robust SFs correlate with better CL performance. Interestingly, models trained with different CL strategies learn complementary concepts, boosting performance when fused. While CL outperforms hard-to-easy orderings, it doesn't consistently beat uniform sampling, suggesting the advantage over standard training is limited.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six scoring functions (C-score, CVLoss, CumAcc, FIT, CELoss, TT, PD) for estimating sample difficulty in curriculum learning. The authors train baseline models on CIFAR-10 (computer vision) and DCASE2020 (acoustic scene classification) using five different architectures (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0/B4, CNN10/14). They assess SF robustness across different random seeds, architectures, and optimizers. CL experiments are conducted with three orderings (easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, random) and four pacing functions (logarithmic, root, linear, exponential). Model performance is evaluated through accuracy metrics and late fusion of models trained with different CL strategies.

## Key Results
- Scoring functions generally agree on difficulty orderings, but robustness to randomness varies significantly
- Ensemble scoring improves robustness of difficulty estimations
- More robust scoring functions correlate with better CL performance
- Models trained with different CL strategies learn complementary concepts that boost performance when fused
- CL outperforms hard-to-easy orderings but doesn't consistently beat uniform sampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Curriculum learning benefits arise from the interaction between sample difficulty ordering and the model's optimization landscape, not from a universally superior difficulty metric.
- **Mechanism:** The model benefits from encountering easier samples first because they provide a smoother loss landscape, allowing faster convergence to favorable parameter regions. Different scoring functions (SFs) may identify different difficulty orderings, but the key factor is that these orderings guide the model through an increasingly complex optimization path.
- **Core assumption:** Early exposure to simpler samples creates a smoother initial loss landscape, aiding optimization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The paper finds that CL outperforms hard-to-easy orderings and shows a clear benefit of CL over ACL, especially with slowly saturating pacing functions.
  - [section] The results indicate that model training is negatively impacted if confronted with difficult samples first, underlining the importance of early exposure to easier data.
- **Break condition:** If the model's optimization landscape is already smooth or the dataset lacks clear difficulty gradients, CL may not provide significant benefits over uniform sampling.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The robustness of a scoring function to randomness and training variations positively correlates with CL performance.
- **Mechanism:** More robust SFs, which are less sensitive to random seeds, model architectures, and optimizers, provide more consistent difficulty orderings. These consistent orderings lead to more reliable CL training schedules, resulting in better model performance.
- **Core assumption:** Consistent difficulty orderings across different training settings lead to more effective CL.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The paper finds that the robustness of scoring functions across random seeds positively correlates with CL performance.
  - [section] The study reports a strong dependence of scoring functions on the training setting, including randomness, which can partly be mitigated through ensemble scoring.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset's inherent difficulty structure is too complex or varied, even robust SFs may not capture the optimal ordering for CL.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Models trained with different CL strategies learn complementary concepts, boosting performance when fused.
- **Mechanism:** Different difficulty orderings (e.g., easy-to-hard vs. hard-to-easy) guide the model to focus on different aspects of the data during training. This results in models that have learned distinct, yet complementary, representations of the data. Late fusion of these models leverages this diversity, leading to improved overall performance.
- **Core assumption:** Different CL strategies lead to models that learn distinct and complementary representations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The paper uncovers that models trained with different CL strategies complement each other by boosting predictive power through late fusion.
  - [section] The study finds that the fusion of CL and ACL performs better, suggesting that these opposing difficulty orderings may complement each other, indicating an exploitable difference in the learnt concepts between CL and ACL.
- **Break condition:** If the different CL strategies do not lead to sufficiently distinct representations, late fusion may not provide significant performance gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Scoring Functions (SFs) for Sample Difficulty Estimation
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding the different SFs is crucial for evaluating their robustness and impact on CL performance.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the main categories of SFs discussed in the paper, and how do they differ in their approach to estimating sample difficulty?

- **Concept:** Curriculum Learning (CL) Strategies
  - **Why needed here:** Knowing the different CL strategies and their effects is essential for understanding the paper's findings on CL performance.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key differences between easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, and random curriculum orderings, and how do they impact model performance?

- **Concept:** Ensemble Scoring and Its Benefits
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding ensemble scoring is important for interpreting the paper's findings on SF robustness and its impact on CL.
  - **Quick check question:** How does ensemble scoring improve the robustness of SFs, and why is this important for CL performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Datasets: CIFAR-10 -> DCASE2020
  Network Architectures: ResNet50 -> EfficientNet-B0/B4 -> CNN10/14
  Scoring Functions: C-score -> CVLoss -> CumAcc -> FIT -> CELoss -> TT -> PD
  Curriculum Learning: Easy-to-hard -> Hard-to-easy -> Random orderings with pacing functions
  Evaluation: Model performance -> SF robustness -> late fusion performance

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train baseline models with different architectures and hyperparameters
  2. Calculate SFs for each sample in the training set
  3. Evaluate SF robustness across different training settings
  4. Perform CL experiments with different SF-based orderings
  5. Analyze CL performance and late fusion results

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Computational cost vs. SF accuracy: More accurate SFs (e.g., C-score) are computationally expensive
  - SF granularity vs. robustness: Coarse-grained SFs may be more robust but less precise
  - CL ordering vs. pacing function: Quickly saturating pacing functions generally lead to better performance

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor CL performance despite using robust SFs: Indicates that the dataset's difficulty structure may not be suitable for CL
  - High variance in SF rankings across different seeds: Suggests that the SF is not robust and may not provide consistent difficulty orderings
  - Late fusion not improving performance: Indicates that the models trained with different CL strategies may not have learned sufficiently complementary concepts

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train baseline models on CIFAR-10 and DCASE2020 with different architectures and hyperparameters
  2. Calculate SFs for each sample in the training set and evaluate their robustness across different training settings
  3. Perform CL experiments with easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, and random orderings using a robust SF (e.g., ensemble scoring) and analyze the performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do different difficulty definitions affect the long-term generalization capabilities of curriculum learning models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses how models trained with different CL strategies complement each other through late fusion, suggesting they learn different concepts. However, it doesn't investigate whether these differences impact long-term generalization.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on immediate performance metrics but doesn't examine how curriculum learning affects model robustness to distribution shifts or performance on unseen data over extended periods.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Long-term studies comparing generalization performance of models trained with different difficulty definitions on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, including analysis of model behavior under distribution shifts.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the interaction between scoring function robustness and dataset complexity influence curriculum learning effectiveness?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper shows that scoring function robustness correlates with CL performance on CIFAR-10 but not DCASE2020, suggesting dataset complexity may play a role. The paper doesn't explore this interaction systematically.
- **Why unresolved:** The study doesn't control for or analyze how dataset complexity (e.g., number of classes, inter-class similarity, data quality) affects the relationship between SF robustness and CL performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled experiments varying dataset complexity while measuring both SF robustness and CL performance, potentially revealing thresholds or patterns in their interaction.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the computational trade-offs between using robust scoring functions and simpler approaches in curriculum learning?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper mentions that more robust scoring functions (achieved through ensemble scoring) require training multiple models, while simpler approaches like CELoss are computationally cheaper but less robust.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper doesn't quantify the computational costs of different approaches or analyze whether the performance gains from robust scoring functions justify the additional computational overhead.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Detailed analysis comparing computational costs (training time, memory usage) against performance improvements for different scoring function strategies, potentially identifying optimal trade-offs for different use cases.

## Limitations

- The computational expense of sophisticated scoring functions like C-score and PD may limit their practical applicability in large-scale settings
- The study focuses on immediate performance metrics without examining long-term generalization capabilities or robustness to distribution shifts
- While different CL strategies show complementarity in late fusion, the specific model behaviors and feature representations that lead to this complementarity require further investigation

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The empirical finding that CL outperforms hard-to-easy orderings and that robust scoring functions correlate with better CL performance
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that ensemble scoring improves robustness, though magnitude of improvement varies across experimental conditions
- **Medium confidence:** The observation that different CL strategies lead to complementary model behaviors, though specific mechanisms require further investigation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate whether CL benefits arise from the difficulty ordering itself or from the gradual increase in sample complexity during training

2. Systematically evaluate the computational cost-benefit tradeoff of different scoring functions across larger-scale datasets and model architectures

3. Investigate the specific model behaviors and feature representations that emerge from different CL strategies to better understand the source of complementarity in late fusion
