# How to Squeeze An Explanation Out of Your Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05134
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05134
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a novel model-agnostic interpretability method based on Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for deep learning models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a model-agnostic interpretability method using Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to create visual attention heatmaps. The approach involves incorporating an SE block before the classification layer of any model, enabling the extraction of the most influential features through SE vector manipulation. The method generates visual attention heatmaps similar to existing approaches but without requiring significant adaptations for different model architectures or data settings.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates an SE block into any deep learning model before the classification layer. During inference, the SE vector is extracted and its values are analyzed to identify the most influential channels. The top 10% of SE vector values are selected based on a normal distribution assumption, and these channels are combined using bicubic interpolation with the original image to create interpretable heatmaps. The approach is evaluated on various datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, AVA-ActiveSpeaker, and WASD, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art interpretability methods.

## Key Results
- The inclusion of SE blocks does not compromise model performance on the original task
- The method provides competitive interpretability results compared to GradCAM, GradCAM++, EigenGradCAM, and FullGradCAM
- Quantitative evaluations using deletion and insertion metrics show the SE-based approach performs competitively with existing methods
- The method is effective in multi-modal settings, particularly for behavioral biometrics using Active Speaker Detection datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SE blocks inherently assess channel importance for model performance
- Mechanism: The Squeeze-and-Excitation block compresses spatial dimensions via global average pooling, then uses fully connected layers to generate channel importance weights (s vector). These weights represent learned importance for each channel to complete the task.
- Core assumption: Channel importance weights correlate with visual interpretability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By including an SE block prior to the classification layer of any model, we are able to retrieve the most influential features via SE vector manipulation"
  - [section] "The novelty of our approach is the inclusion of a single SE block at the end of different models, in particular before average pooling to provide visual interpretability similar to those obtained from GradCAM-like approaches"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If SE vector values don't follow a meaningful distribution or if the top percentage channels don't correspond to actual model attention regions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Normal distribution of SE vector values enables objective thresholding
- Mechanism: The SE values follow a normal distribution across different models and datasets, allowing selection of top 10% values as "important" channels using statistical properties
- Core assumption: The normality of SE values is consistent across different architectures and datasets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we use its formula to obtain the top 10% values of the SE vector (and, consequently, the top 10% channels) for visual interpretability purposes... we obtain the normal distributions by grouping the SE values of all models for each dataset, by normalization with mean to 0"
  - [section] "Given that the values of the SE vector in our experiments follow a Normal distribution"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence supporting normal distribution assumption
- Break condition: If SE value distribution deviates significantly from normality for certain models or datasets

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bicubic interpolation preserves spatial relationships when combining channel features
- Mechanism: After selecting top 10% channels, bicubic interpolation is applied to these features before combining with the original image to create heatmaps
- Core assumption: Bicubic interpolation maintains the spatial structure necessary for accurate attention visualization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Finally, we conjugate the selected channels using bicubic interpolation on top of the original image to provide a heatmap of the most important regions for model decision"
  - [section] "The results show that our approach is able to output reliable and interpretable results for various settings"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence about interpolation method choice
- Break condition: If interpolation introduces artifacts that obscure actual model attention or if alternative interpolation methods produce significantly different results

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Squeeze-and-Excitation block architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SE blocks work is fundamental to modifying them for interpretability purposes
  - Quick check question: What are the three phases of an SE block and what does each accomplish?

- Concept: Channel-wise feature importance
  - Why needed here: The method relies on interpreting channel weights as visual importance indicators
  - Quick check question: How do the SE weights relate to feature importance in the original SE block design?

- Concept: Visual interpretability metrics
  - Why needed here: To evaluate the quality of generated heatmaps against established benchmarks
  - Quick check question: What do Deletion and Insertion metrics measure in interpretability evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Original model -> SE block (before classification layer) -> SE vector extraction and thresholding -> Channel selection and bicubic interpolation -> Heatmap generation and visualization

- Critical path:
  1. Insert SE block before final classification layer
  2. Extract SE vector during forward pass
  3. Compute threshold using normal distribution
  4. Select top 10% channels
  5. Apply bicubic interpolation to selected channels
  6. Combine with original image to generate heatmap

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 10% threshold provides balance between coverage and specificity
  - Bicubic interpolation vs. other methods affects spatial accuracy
  - SE block placement (before pooling vs. elsewhere) impacts interpretation quality

- Failure signatures:
  - Heatmaps showing no clear attention regions
  - Performance degradation on original task (>5% drop)
  - SE values following non-normal distributions
  - Heatmaps highlighting irrelevant regions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Add SE block to ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, compare original vs. SE-included accuracy
  2. Generate heatmaps for ResNet50 on CIFAR-100, compare with GradCAM outputs
  3. Apply to multi-modal ASD model, evaluate attention on facial vs. body regions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method relies on the assumption that SE vector values follow a normal distribution across different models and datasets, which lacks strong empirical validation
- The generalizability of the 10% threshold for channel selection across diverse model architectures and data distributions remains uncertain
- The choice of bicubic interpolation for heatmap generation is not justified through comparative analysis with alternative methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The SE block integration mechanism and its basic implementation are well-established and reproducible. The claim that adding SE blocks does not significantly impact model performance is supported by the experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The method's effectiveness in generating interpretable heatmaps is demonstrated through qualitative examples and quantitative metrics. However, the reliance on normal distribution assumptions and the 10% threshold selection requires further validation.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the approach to extremely diverse datasets and architectures beyond those tested, and the robustness of the bicubic interpolation method for heatmap generation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of SE vector value distributions across a wider range of models and datasets to validate the normality assumption and assess the robustness of the 10% threshold selection
2. Compare the bicubic interpolation method with other interpolation techniques (e.g., nearest neighbor, bilinear) to evaluate their impact on the spatial accuracy and quality of the generated heatmaps
3. Test the method on additional datasets with varying characteristics (e.g., different image sizes, modalities) to assess its generalizability and identify any limitations or adjustments needed for broader applicability
