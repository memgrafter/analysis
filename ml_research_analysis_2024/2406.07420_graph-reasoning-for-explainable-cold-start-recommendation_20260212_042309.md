# Graph Reasoning for Explainable Cold Start Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07420
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GRECS framework provides explainable cold start recommendations by leveraging explicit paths in Knowledge Graphs, outperforming baselines on five standard datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the cold start problem in recommender systems by proposing GRECS, a framework that adapts Graph Reasoning methods to provide explainable recommendations for users or items with limited interaction history. The key innovation is using explicit paths from users to items in a Knowledge Graph rather than relying solely on entity embeddings. By navigating the graph through non-interaction relations, GRECS can find items matching user preferences even with minimal information. Experiments demonstrate that GRECS outperforms competitive baselines while providing explanations for recommendations and mitigating popularity bias.

## Method Summary
GRECS integrates cold entities into a Knowledge Graph using non-interaction relations, then assigns them meaningful embeddings through average translations from related entities. The framework employs reinforcement learning agents (PGPR or UPGPR) to find paths from cold users to items in the graph. During training, a KG embedding model is first trained on the full graph, followed by RL agent optimization for path finding. For cold start scenarios, the approach adds non-interaction relations for cold entities, computes embeddings via average translation, and uses the trained RL agent to recommend items based on found paths. The method is evaluated on five standard datasets with metrics including nDCG@10, HR@10, POPB@10, and cold item coverage.

## Key Results
- GRECS outperforms competitive baselines across 5 standard datasets in cold start recommendation scenarios
- The approach mitigates popularity bias by exploring KG structure rather than comparing users to all items
- GRECS requires only a small number of relations to provide accurate recommendations, with relevance improving further as few interactions are added

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GRECS provides relevant recommendations to strict cold start users by leveraging explicit paths from users to items in the knowledge graph, rather than relying solely on entity embeddings.
- Mechanism: By navigating the knowledge graph through non-interaction relations (e.g., interested_in, like), GRECS can identify items that match user preferences even without interaction history. The RL agent finds paths from users to items, and the path-based reasoning inherently explains the recommendations.
- Core assumption: The knowledge graph contains sufficient non-interaction relations that meaningfully connect users to items, and the RL agent can effectively navigate these paths to find relevant recommendations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By utilizing explicit paths starting for users rather than relying only on entity embeddings, GRECS can find items corresponding to users' preferences by navigating the graph, even when limited information about users is available."
  - [section 3.3]: "Given a new entity e not in E related to a small set of entities via non-interaction relations (r not equal to interacted), we add all triplets containing e to G."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. While related papers mention cold-start solutions using graphs, they don't specifically address path-based reasoning as GRECS does.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GRECS mitigates popularity bias by exploring the knowledge graph structure rather than comparing users to all items based on similarity.
- Mechanism: By restricting recommendations to items reachable through paths in the knowledge graph, GRECS avoids the tendency of similarity-based methods to recommend popular items. The path-based approach inherently diversifies recommendations.
- Core assumption: The knowledge graph structure inherently provides a diverse set of paths to items, reducing the dominance of popular items in recommendations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GRECS mitigates the cold start problem and outperforms competitive baselines across 5 standard datasets while being explainable."
  - [section 5.3]: "These results suggest that GRECS is better suited to handle popularity bias than the baseline approaches, due to its exploration of the KG, which restricts the set of recommendable items."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. While related papers mention popularity bias in cold-start scenarios, they don't specifically attribute bias mitigation to path-based reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GRECS requires only a small number of relations to provide accurate recommendations, and providing few interactions increases the relevance of recommendations even further.
- Mechanism: By initializing cold entities with embeddings based on average translations from their related entities, GRECS provides meaningful starting points for the RL agent. Even with limited relations, the agent can navigate the graph to find relevant items. With a few interactions, the agent can refine its recommendations.
- Core assumption: The average translation method for initializing cold embeddings provides meaningful representations, and the RL agent can effectively use these embeddings to navigate the graph.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "To this end, we propose to calculate the embedding for a new entity by using the average translations from its related entities."
  - [section 5.4]: "Generally, GRECS benefits from an increase in known relations for strict cold start users, with HRs improving initially with the addition of a few relations."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. While related papers mention cold-start solutions requiring minimal data, they don't specifically address the use of average translations for embedding initialization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their role in recommender systems
  - Why needed here: GRECS leverages KGs to provide recommendations to cold start users and items. Understanding KGs is fundamental to understanding how GRECS works.
  - Quick check question: What is a knowledge graph, and how does it differ from traditional user-item interaction data in recommender systems?

- Concept: Graph Reasoning (GR) methods and their application in explainable recommendations
  - Why needed here: GRECS adapts GR methods to cold start scenarios. Understanding GR is crucial for understanding how GRECS provides explainable recommendations.
  - Quick check question: How do graph reasoning methods differ from traditional embedding-based recommendation methods, and what are the advantages of GR in terms of explainability?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its application in path-finding
  - Why needed here: GRECS uses RL to find paths from users to items in the knowledge graph. Understanding RL is essential for understanding how GRECS navigates the graph to find recommendations.
  - Quick check question: How does reinforcement learning work in the context of finding paths in a graph, and what are the key components of an RL agent used for this purpose?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Knowledge Graph (KG) -> Graph Reasoning Models (PGPR, UPGPR) -> GRECS Framework -> Embedding Initialization -> RL Agent -> Recommendations

- Critical path:
  1. Integrate cold entities into the KG using non-interaction relations
  2. Assign cold entities meaningful embeddings using average translations
  3. Use the RL agent to find paths from cold users to items in the KG
  4. Provide recommendations and explanations based on the found paths

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding Initialization: Average translations vs. null embeddings. Average translations provide more meaningful starting points but require more computation.
  - RL Agent: PGPR vs. UPGPR. PGPR uses predefined path patterns, while UPGPR uses a binary reward scheme. PGPR may be more interpretable, while UPGPR may be more flexible.
  - Knowledge Graph Structure: The diversity and quality of non-interaction relations in the KG significantly impact the effectiveness of GRECS.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor recommendations: If the KG lacks meaningful non-interaction relations, or if the RL agent fails to navigate the graph effectively.
  - High popularity bias: If the KG structure still leads to popular items through common paths, or if the RL agent is biased towards certain paths.
  - Low cold item coverage: If the KG does not contain enough paths to cold items, or if the RL agent fails to find these paths.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate GRECS on a small KG with limited non-interaction relations to assess its ability to provide recommendations with minimal data.
  2. Compare the performance of PGPR and UPGPR on a KG with diverse non-interaction relations to assess the impact of the reward scheme on recommendation quality.
  3. Test the effectiveness of average translations vs. null embeddings for cold entity initialization on a KG with varying levels of sparsity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of GRECS scale with increasing KG size and complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates GRECS on five datasets but does not explore performance across varying KG sizes or complexities.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating effectiveness within the tested datasets but does not systematically vary KG size or complexity to assess scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying KG size and complexity while measuring performance metrics like nDCG and HR would provide insights into scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using more advanced KG embedding methods beyond translational embeddings in GRECS?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using translational embeddings but does not explore other embedding methods like RotatE or ComplEx.
- Why unresolved: The choice of translational embeddings is justified, but the paper does not investigate whether alternative embedding methods could enhance performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing GRECS performance using different KG embedding methods while keeping other components constant would reveal the impact of embedding choice.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does GRECS handle cold start scenarios where users have very diverse preferences with no common categories or brands?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes users have at least one known relation but does not address scenarios with highly diverse preferences.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore edge cases where users have no common interests, which could challenge the path-finding approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing GRECS on users with highly diverse preferences and measuring performance would indicate robustness in extreme cold start scenarios.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the cold embedding assignment strategy be generalized to other GR methods beyond PGPR and UPGPR?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the cold embedding strategy is specific to PGPR and UPGPR and suggests future work to extend it to other GR approaches.
- Why unresolved: While the strategy is effective for the tested methods, its applicability to other GR approaches remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the cold embedding strategy to other GR methods like LLMs and evaluating performance would determine its generalizability.

## Limitations
- The core claims about explainability and popularity bias mitigation rely heavily on assumptions about KG quality and RL agent effectiveness that aren't exhaustively validated
- Evaluation only compares against baselines without exhaustively exploring alternative path-based methods
- The choice between PGPR and UPGPR is not fully justified, and the impact of KG quality on recommendation performance is not thoroughly investigated

## Confidence

- High confidence: GRECS provides relevant recommendations to strict cold start users by leveraging explicit paths in the knowledge graph.
- Medium confidence: GRECS mitigates popularity bias through path-based exploration of the knowledge graph.
- Medium confidence: GRECS requires only a small number of relations to provide accurate recommendations, and providing few interactions increases the relevance of recommendations.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of KG quality (density and diversity of non-interaction relations) on GRECS's performance.
2. Compare GRECS against other path-based methods (e.g., FIRZEN) to assess its effectiveness in handling popularity bias and cold start scenarios.
3. Evaluate GRECS's performance on KGs with varying levels of sparsity and noise to determine its robustness to KG quality.
