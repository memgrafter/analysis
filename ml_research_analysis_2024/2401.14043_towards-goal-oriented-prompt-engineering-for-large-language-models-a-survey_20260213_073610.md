# Towards Goal-oriented Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.14043
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14043
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: Proposes five-stage framework for goal-oriented prompting that improves LLM performance by up to 32.5% on arithmetic reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews 50 representative studies on goal-oriented prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs), proposing a novel five-stage framework: goal decomposition, action selection, action execution, sub-goal result evaluation, and valuable sub-goal selection. The authors demonstrate that guiding LLMs to follow human logical thinking through goal-oriented prompting significantly improves performance across 11 tasks including arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, planning, and code generation. Performance comparisons show that combining multiple stages consistently outperforms standard prompting methods, with methods incorporating sub-goal selection achieving up to 32.5% improvement in arithmetic reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review of 50 representative studies on goal-oriented prompt engineering for LLMs, systematically categorizing existing methods into a proposed five-stage framework. The review analyzed performance improvements across various tasks including arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, planning, and code generation, comparing methods that incorporated multiple stages against standard prompting approaches. The survey identified emerging directions and challenges in the field while providing detailed analysis of how different stage combinations affect overall performance.

## Key Results
- Goal-oriented prompting framework significantly improves LLM performance by guiding models through structured problem-solving stages
- Methods combining multiple stages consistently outperform single-stage prompting, with sub-goal selection achieving up to 32.5% improvement on arithmetic reasoning
- Integration of external tools in action execution and evaluation stages provides substantial accuracy gains over pure LLM-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Goal-oriented prompting significantly improves LLM performance by explicitly decomposing complex problems into manageable sub-goals.
- Mechanism: The framework guides LLMs through a structured sequence of five stages (goal decomposition, action selection, action execution, sub-goal result evaluation, and valuable sub-goal selection), mimicking established human logical thinking processes.
- Core assumption: LLMs lack inherent ability to decompose complex problems without explicit prompting, unlike humans who naturally use goal-setting strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "From our review of 50 representative studies, we demonstrate that a goal-oriented prompt formulation, which guides LLMs to follow established human logical thinking, significantly improves the performance of LLMs."
  - [section] "Humans are taught by experience to approach complex objectives by breaking down the main goal into more manageable sub-goals, a strategy supported by goal-setting theory (Austin and Vancouver, 1996)."
- Break condition: If LLMs develop intrinsic reasoning capabilities that make explicit decomposition unnecessary, or if the computational overhead of multi-stage prompting outweighs performance gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining multiple stages in the goal-oriented framework consistently outperforms single-stage prompting methods.
- Mechanism: Each additional stage addresses specific failure modes - decomposition handles complexity, action selection ensures valid operations, execution provides accurate results, evaluation catches errors, and selection optimizes the path to final answers.
- Core assumption: Error propagation through reasoning chains can be mitigated by systematic validation at each stage rather than relying on end-to-end correctness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Performance comparisons show that combining multiple stages consistently outperforms standard prompting methods, with methods incorporating sub-goal selection achieving up to 32.5% improvement in arithmetic reasoning tasks."
  - [section] "We observe a gradual increase in performance when integrating additional stages into the method. PoT (Chen et al., 2022) can be considered as a combination of CoT and action execution, it further improves CoT by 14.7% in arithmetic reasoning."
- Break condition: If certain stages become redundant for specific task types, or if the interaction between stages introduces conflicting guidance that degrades performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: External tool integration in action execution and sub-goal evaluation stages significantly improves result accuracy compared to pure LLM-based approaches.
- Mechanism: By offloading computation-intensive or knowledge-dependent sub-tasks to specialized tools (calculators, retrievers, interpreters), the framework reduces hallucination and ensures factual correctness of intermediate results.
- Core assumption: LLM knowledge bases are static and limited, while external tools can provide real-time, verified information and computation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To answer open-domain questions, DecomP (Khot et al., 2022) applies an ElasticSearch-based retrieval system to retrieve knowledge from certain knowledge bases like Wikipedia."
  - [section] "Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022)... translate reasoning processes into executable codes and then run them in an interpreter."
- Break condition: If tool integration introduces latency that makes the system impractical, or if tool availability becomes inconsistent across deployment environments.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Goal-setting theory and decomposition strategies
  - Why needed here: Understanding why humans naturally decompose goals helps explain why this approach works for LLMs and provides theoretical grounding for the framework design.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between human problem-solving approaches and LLM processing that make explicit decomposition necessary?

- Concept: Error propagation in reasoning chains
  - Why needed here: The framework's effectiveness relies on understanding how mistakes at early stages affect final outputs, justifying the need for evaluation and selection stages.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework's multi-stage validation approach reduce error propagation compared to end-to-end prompting methods?

- Concept: Tool integration and API orchestration
  - Why needed here: Many effective implementations require coordinating multiple external tools, understanding their capabilities and limitations is crucial for practical deployment.
  - Quick check question: What criteria should be used to determine when to use an external tool versus relying on LLM capabilities for a given sub-task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Goal decomposition -> Action selection -> Action execution -> Sub-goal evaluation -> Valuable sub-goal selection -> Final answer synthesis

- Critical path: Goal decomposition → Action selection → Action execution → Sub-goal evaluation → Valuable sub-goal selection → Final answer
  - Each stage must complete successfully before proceeding to the next, with error handling at evaluation stages.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM-only vs. tool-integrated execution: Trade accuracy for speed/complexity
  - Iterative vs. plan-then-execute decomposition: Trade flexibility for efficiency
  - Self-evaluation vs. external validation: Trade simplicity for reliability

- Failure signatures:
  - Early stage decomposition errors: Incorrect final answers with plausible intermediate steps
  - Action selection failures: Generation of invalid operations or impossible actions
  - Tool integration failures: System hangs or incorrect tool responses
  - Evaluation stage failures: Inconsistent validation results or infinite refinement loops

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-stage CoT baseline on arithmetic reasoning tasks to establish performance floor
  2. Add sub-goal evaluation stage using self-refine approach to measure improvement
  3. Implement tool-integrated execution for mathematical operations to verify accuracy gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does hierarchical goal decomposition impact performance across different task domains compared to single-layer decomposition?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses hierarchical decomposition as an emerging direction and cites Li et al. 2023's work on script generation with hierarchical decomposition.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies hierarchical decomposition as promising, it notes that existing work relies on pre-defined trees and lacks exploration of more complex graph structures. No comparative studies across task domains are provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing single-layer vs. hierarchical decomposition across multiple task types (arithmetic, planning, code generation) with performance metrics and efficiency measurements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in multi-stage goal-oriented prompting methods for complex reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses RAP and GDP-Zero's use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to balance exploration and exploitation, noting this outperforms heuristic-based search for complex tasks.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies MCTS as superior, it doesn't provide guidance on when to use MCTS vs. other approaches, or how to determine the optimal balance point for different task complexities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different exploration-exploitation strategies across varying task complexities with metrics on solution quality, number of iterations, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can stage synergy be systematically designed to minimize computational overhead while maximizing performance gains?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper identifies stage synergy as a key challenge, noting that while combining stages shows promise, naive combinations are computationally expensive and require careful integration.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the power of stage synergy but doesn't provide systematic frameworks for integration or guidelines for balancing performance gains against computational costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Framework proposals for systematic stage integration with ablation studies showing performance per computational unit, plus case studies demonstrating efficient implementations for specific task types.

## Limitations

- The survey's framework applicability across diverse LLM architectures remains unclear, as the literature review focuses primarily on transformer-based models without examining other architectures.
- Performance metrics aggregation methodology is not fully specified, making it difficult to verify the claimed improvements.
- Computational overhead of multi-stage prompting compared to standard methods is not quantified, which could impact real-world deployment decisions.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The framework's five-stage structure is well-supported by literature examples and theoretical grounding in goal-setting theory
- Medium confidence: Performance improvement claims are supported by multiple studies but lack standardized comparison methodology
- Low confidence: The generalizability of findings across different LLM sizes, domains, and deployment scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of each stage in the five-stage framework, isolating the performance impact of decomposition, action selection, and evaluation components
2. Benchmark the framework across multiple LLM architectures (GPT, BERT, T5 variants) to verify architectural independence and identify any architecture-specific limitations
3. Measure end-to-end inference latency and computational cost for multi-stage prompting compared to standard prompting, establishing practical deployment thresholds for different use cases
