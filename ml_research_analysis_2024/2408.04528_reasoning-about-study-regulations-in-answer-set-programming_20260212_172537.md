# Reasoning about Study Regulations in Answer Set Programming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04528
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04528
- Reference count: 2
- This paper presents a formalization of study regulations as a tuple of modules, groups, credits, and constraints, enabling automated reasoning about admissible study plans.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a formalization of study regulations as a tuple of modules, groups, credits, and constraints, enabling automated reasoning about admissible study plans. The authors model study plans as sequences of module sets and define admissibility via global and temporal constraints. They implement this in Answer Set Programming (ASP), encoding the regulations and generating valid plans. A generic ASP-driven user interface is also proposed for interactive exploration. As a case study, the Cognitive Systems master program at the University of Potsdam is formalized and solved, demonstrating the approach’s practical applicability.

## Method Summary
The paper formalizes study regulations as a tuple of modules, groups, credits, and constraints, then encodes this in ASP using a general encoding with specific instance facts. The ASP solver (clingo) is used to generate admissible study plans, which are then explored interactively via a user interface built with clinguin and Angular. The approach is demonstrated on the Cognitive Systems master program at the University of Potsdam.

## Key Results
- Formalized study regulations as a tuple of modules, groups, credits, and constraints
- Implemented ASP encoding for generating admissible study plans
- Demonstrated practical applicability through the Cognitive Systems case study
- Proposed a generic ASP-driven user interface for interactive exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The formalization of study regulations as a tuple of modules, groups, credits, and constraints enables automated reasoning about admissible study plans.
- **Mechanism:** The tuple-based structure captures the hierarchical and modular nature of study regulations, allowing constraints to be expressed as mathematical sets over sequences of module sets. This structure is directly translatable into ASP facts and rules.
- **Core assumption:** Study regulations can be adequately represented as sets and functions without losing semantic meaning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The authors model study plans as sequences of module sets and define admissibility via global and temporal constraints."
  - [section] "A basic study regulation is a tuple ( M, G, c, s, l, u, Rg, Rt), where..."
- **Break condition:** If study regulations contain non-set-based rules (e.g., vague "best practice" recommendations), the formalization may fail to capture them accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The separation of global and temporal constraints allows for clear modeling of both static and dynamic aspects of study regulations.
- **Mechanism:** Global constraints (Rg) operate over the entire set of modules, while temporal constraints (Rt) operate over the sequence of semesters. This separation simplifies encoding and reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** The distinction between global and temporal constraints is sufficient to capture all necessary regulation types.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "The regulation constraints in Rg and Rt are represented extensionally... While the sets of constraints Rg and Rt share the same mathematical structure, they differ in purpose and are therefore separated for clarity’s sake."
  - [corpus] "The first temporal constraint in Rt, given in (31), forbids the same examination task from being completed in two distinct semesters."
- **Break condition:** If regulations require cross-semester reasoning that is not purely temporal (e.g., cumulative GPA requirements), this separation may be insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The ASP-driven user interface allows interactive exploration and completion of partial study plans.
- **Mechanism:** The interface generates dropdown menus and containers based on ASP models, allowing users to select modules and see valid completions in real-time.
- **Core assumption:** User interactions can be mapped to ASP assumptions without breaking the constraint system.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Finally, we show how this approach can be extended to a generic user interface for exploring study plans."
  - [section] "The UI is defined by predicates elem/3, attr/3 and when/4, for specifying the UI’s layout, style and functionality, respectively."
- **Break condition:** If the user makes selections that lead to an unsatisfiable constraint set, the interface must handle this gracefully.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Answer Set Programming (ASP) fundamentals
  - **Why needed here:** ASP is the core reasoning engine used to encode and solve study regulation problems.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between a choice rule and a constraint in ASP?

- **Concept:** Set theory and mathematical logic
  - **Why needed here:** The formalization of study regulations relies heavily on set operations and logical constraints.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you express "module A must be taken before module B" using set operations?

- **Concept:** User interface design for interactive systems
  - **Why needed here:** The ASP-driven UI requires understanding how to map user actions to ASP assumptions and how to display results.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key considerations when designing a dropdown menu for module selection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Study Regulation Formalization -> ASP Encoding -> Solver (clingo) -> User Interface (clinguin + Angular)

- **Critical path:**
  1. User selects modules via UI
  2. Selections are translated to ASP assumptions
  3. ASP solver finds valid study plans
  4. UI displays available options based on models

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Generality vs. Efficiency:** The encoding is designed for readability and broad applicability, but may not be optimized for performance.
  - **User Freedom vs. Constraint Enforcement:** The UI allows exploration but must prevent invalid selections.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Solver returns no models: Indicates unsatisfiable constraints (possibly due to user selections).
  - UI does not update: Indicates a disconnect between the ASP backend and the frontend.
  - Unexpected module options: Indicates a bug in the assumption translation logic.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test the basic study regulation encoding with a simple set of modules and constraints to ensure the ASP solver finds expected models.
  2. Test the UI with a pre-defined set of user selections to ensure the dropdown menus and containers update correctly.
  3. Test the system with an unsatisfiable constraint set to ensure the UI handles this gracefully (e.g., by disabling further selections or showing an error message).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How scalable is the ASP-based approach for larger study regulations with more complex constraints?
- How can the formalization of study regulations be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as subarea specializations, module dependencies, and blocking modules?
- How can the ASP-driven user interface be enhanced to provide more advanced features for exploring and interacting with study plans?

## Limitations
- The formalization assumes study regulations can be fully captured as sets and functions, potentially missing nuanced requirements.
- The separation of global and temporal constraints may be insufficient for regulations requiring complex cross-semester reasoning.
- The ASP-driven UI's handling of unsatisfiable constraint sets due to user selections is not fully detailed.

## Confidence
- **High**: The core ASP encoding methodology for generating admissible study plans is well-established and validated through the Cognitive Systems case study.
- **Medium**: The extension to examination tasks and the generic UI approach are promising but lack complete implementation details in the paper.
- **Low**: The handling of non-formalized study regulation aspects and the UI's behavior in unsatisfiable scenarios have not been thoroughly addressed.

## Next Checks
1. Test the ASP encoding with a simple study regulation instance to verify it generates expected models and handles edge cases (e.g., conflicting constraints).
2. Reproduce the Cognitive Systems case study to confirm the encoding accurately captures the program's requirements and generates valid study plans.
3. Implement a basic clinguin UI for a small study regulation instance to assess the practical feasibility and user experience of the interactive exploration feature.
