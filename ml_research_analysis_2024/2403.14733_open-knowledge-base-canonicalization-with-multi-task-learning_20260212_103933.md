# Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization with Multi-task Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14733
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14733
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 0.870 average F1 score on COMBO benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MulCanon, a multi-task learning framework for open knowledge base canonicalization that unifies clustering, diffusion modeling, knowledge graph embedding, and side information modeling. The framework uses a two-stage training strategy where diffusion modeling and clustering are trained first, followed by integration of all tasks including knowledge graph embedding. A key innovation is the use of diffusion models for soft clustering instead of traditional variational autoencoders, combined with enhanced noun phrase representations that incorporate first-order neighboring information. Experiments on the COMBO benchmark show MulCanon achieves an average F1 score of 0.870, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

## Method Summary
MulCanon is a multi-task learning framework for OKB canonicalization that employs a two-stage training approach. Stage 1 trains clustering components (diffusion model, soft clustering) with side information, while Stage 2 integrates knowledge graph embedding (KGE) for comprehensive training. The framework uses diffusion models instead of VAEs to avoid information loss during clustering, and enhances noun phrase representations by concatenating GloVe embeddings with first-order neighboring entity information. The multi-task loss combines clustering loss, diffusion loss, KGE loss, and side information loss. The model is trained on OKB triples using pre-trained GloVe embeddings and various side information sources.

## Key Results
- MulCanon achieves 0.870 average F1 score on COMBO benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches
- Two-stage training strategy shows improved stability compared to single-stage approaches
- Diffusion model soft clustering outperforms traditional hard clustering methods
- Neighbor-enhanced embeddings provide meaningful improvements in clustering quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diffusion models avoid information loss during clustering compared to VAEs
- Mechanism: Diffusion models perform iterative noise addition/removal in the same dimensional space, avoiding the compression-expansion cycle that causes information distortion
- Core assumption: The noise schedule and reverse process can be learned to recover meaningful representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Instead of adopting the original VAE model, we propose to utilize the diffusion model to avoid the potential information loss during the transformation"
  - [section] "Compared with the hard clustering strategy used in the majority of existing works, the soft clustering of the generative model can help to explain different meanings of a given entity mention."
- Break condition: If the learned reverse process cannot adequately denoise representations, or if the noise schedule is poorly chosen

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage multi-task learning improves stability and performance
- Mechanism: Stage 1 trains clustering components without KGE to obtain stable clustering parameters, then Stage 2 integrates KGE for comprehensive training
- Core assumption: KGE training depends on stable cluster assignments from earlier stage
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "adopts a two-stage multi-task learning paradigm for training"
  - [section] "Considering that training KGE requires the outputs of clustering, in stage 1, we eliminate the KGE sub-task to obtain relatively stable parameters of the clustering module."
- Break condition: If cluster assignments change significantly between stages, causing KGE to learn unstable representations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: First-order neighbor information enhances noun phrase representations
- Mechanism: Concatenates GloVe embeddings of neighboring entities to augment base representations
- Core assumption: Neighboring entities provide meaningful contextual information that improves clustering
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We consider that the initial representations of noun phrases directly obtained by using GloVe vectors cannot adequately represent their corresponding features."
  - [section] "In detail, for example, taking san juan and san jose as an example, after adding the information of first-order neighboring noun phrases, san juan's neighboring noun phrases are hiram bithorn stadium and isla verde international airport."
- Break condition: If first-order neighbors are too sparse or irrelevant, the concatenation provides no meaningful signal

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE)
  - Why needed here: Provides the soft clustering framework that MulCanon builds upon
  - Quick check question: How does VaDE combine GMM with VAE, and what problem does this solve for clustering?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)
  - Why needed here: Ensures canonicalized phrases satisfy KG structural constraints
  - Quick check question: What properties do KGE methods like HolE and TransE capture, and how do they differ?

- Concept: Diffusion Models
  - Why needed here: Replaces VAE to avoid information loss during representation learning
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between diffusion models and traditional generative models like VAE in terms of dimensional transformation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → GloVe embedding → Neighbor augmentation → Forward diffusion → Reverse diffusion → Cluster assignment → KGE → Side information → Multi-task loss → Output
- Critical path: GloVe → Neighbor augmentation → Forward diffusion → Reverse diffusion → Cluster assignment → KGE → Multi-task loss
- Design tradeoffs: Two-stage training adds complexity but improves stability; diffusion models are computationally heavier than VAEs but avoid information loss
- Failure signatures: Poor cluster quality (low F1 scores), unstable training across stages, neighbor information provides no benefit
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Implement HAC baseline with GloVe embeddings only
  2. Diffusion ablation: Remove diffusion model and replace with standard VAE
  3. Neighbor ablation: Remove neighbor information augmentation to measure impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of MulCanon vary with different numbers of diffusion steps in the forward and reverse diffusion processes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the time step T is set to 2 and states this will be analyzed in hyper-parameter analysis, but the actual results of varying T are not provided in the main paper.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports results for T=2 without showing the impact of varying this parameter on performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study showing F1 scores for different values of T (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10) on the COMBO dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does MulCanon's performance compare to state-of-the-art methods on other OKB canonicalization datasets beyond COMBO and ReVerb45K?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only reports results on COMBO and ReVerb45K, but OKB canonicalization research uses multiple datasets. The performance on other datasets remains unknown.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation is limited to two datasets, and the paper does not discuss generalization to other benchmarks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on additional OKB canonicalization benchmarks such as DeepEx and others, showing macro/micro/pair F1 scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is MulCanon to the choice of knowledge graph embedding model (e.g., replacing HolE with TransE or other alternatives)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "using different knowledge graph embedding models has little impact on the overall performance of the model" but provides no quantitative evidence or ablation results.
- Why unresolved: The claim about model insensitivity is stated without supporting experimental data comparing different KGE models.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study showing F1 scores when using different KGE models (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, etc.) on the same dataset with identical settings.

## Limitations
- Diffusion model implementation details remain unspecified, particularly neural network architecture for reverse process
- Two-stage training approach introduces complexity and potential instability if cluster assignments shift
- Neighbor enhancement relies on first-order neighbor information that may not always be available or meaningful
- Claims about diffusion models avoiding information loss lack direct empirical validation through head-to-head comparisons

## Confidence

**High Confidence** claims:
- Overall framework architecture and multi-task learning formulation are well-specified
- Experimental results on COMBO benchmark showing F1 scores of 0.870 are verifiable
- Two-stage training strategy is clearly described and implementable
- Importance of integrating multiple tasks is supported by ablation results

**Medium Confidence** claims:
- Diffusion models provide better information preservation than VAEs (lacks direct comparative experiments)
- First-order neighbor information meaningfully enhances representations (limited ablation evidence)
- Two-stage training improves stability and performance (no comparison with single-stage approaches)

**Low Confidence** claims:
- Specific implementation details of diffusion model neural architecture
- Exact integration mechanism of pre-trained language models in PLM-enhanced HAC
- Generalization to other knowledge graph embedding models beyond HolE and TransE

## Next Checks

1. **Diffusion vs VAE Comparison**: Implement a direct comparison between MulCanon's diffusion-based soft clustering and a standard VAE approach using identical network architectures and training procedures. Measure information preservation through reconstruction quality metrics and clustering performance on a held-out validation set.

2. **Neighbor Information Sensitivity**: Conduct experiments systematically varying the amount and quality of neighbor information available. Test scenarios with complete neighbor data, randomly sampled neighbors, and no neighbor information to quantify the actual contribution of the neighbor enhancement mechanism.

3. **Single-stage Multi-task Learning**: Implement a single-stage version of MulCanon where all tasks are trained simultaneously from initialization. Compare training stability, convergence speed, and final performance against the proposed two-stage approach to validate the claimed benefits of the staged training strategy.
