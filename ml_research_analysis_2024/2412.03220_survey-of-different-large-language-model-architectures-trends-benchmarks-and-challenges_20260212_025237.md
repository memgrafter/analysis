# Survey of different Large Language Model Architectures: Trends, Benchmarks, and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.03220
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03220
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of LLM architectures, training methods, benchmarks, and challenges

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic examination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), tracing their evolution from foundational models like BERT and GPT to advanced systems such as GPT-4 and Gemini. The paper categorizes LLMs by architecture type (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder), explores training methodologies including pre-training and fine-tuning, and addresses key challenges such as data quality, bias, and computational demands. It also discusses important benchmarks for evaluating model performance and highlights the transformative potential of LLMs across various domains.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a comprehensive literature review approach, synthesizing information from academic papers, technical reports, and industry publications to provide a broad overview of LLM architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation benchmarks. It systematically categorizes models based on their architectural components and examines their respective strengths and limitations. The survey also explores emerging trends in multimodal learning and discusses the challenges facing LLM development, including data quality issues and computational constraints.

## Key Results
- Categorizes LLMs into encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures with distinct strengths
- Discusses training methodologies including pre-training, fine-tuning, and model compression techniques
- Addresses challenges such as data quality, bias, and computational demands
- Reviews key benchmarks like MMLU, SuperGLUE, and multimodal evaluations for performance assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey systematically categorizes LLMs by architecture to clarify their distinct strengths and limitations
- Mechanism: By mapping each model family to its architectural type, readers can quickly identify which model type suits a given task
- Core assumption: Architectural differences directly translate to task performance differences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "categorizes LLMs into encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures, highlighting their unique strengths and limitations"
  - [section] "Auto-encoding models, often referred to as 'encoder-only models,' utilize solely the encoder component of the Transformer architecture"
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus does not explicitly discuss architectural categorization
- Break condition: If a model's architecture does not correlate with its performance in a given task, the categorization becomes less useful

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The survey uses benchmark comparisons to provide quantitative evidence of model capabilities
- Mechanism: By presenting model performance across standardized benchmarks, the survey allows for objective comparison of model effectiveness
- Core assumption: Benchmark scores accurately reflect real-world model performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Key benchmarks like MMLU, SuperGLUE, and multimodal evaluations are discussed to assess model performance"
  - [section] "These benchmarks test the integration of visual and textual data, crucial for applications requiring a holistic understanding of multimodal inputs"
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus neighbors focus on MLLMs and reasoning but do not specifically mention benchmark comparisons
- Break condition: If benchmark results do not generalize to real-world tasks, the comparisons become misleading

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey addresses challenges such as data quality, bias, and computational demands to provide a balanced view
- Mechanism: By discussing limitations and ongoing challenges, the survey prevents over-optimistic interpretations of LLM capabilities
- Core assumption: Acknowledging challenges is essential for realistic progress in LLM development
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "while addressing challenges such as data quality, bias, and computational demands"
  - [section] "The use of massive datasets is one of the main characteristics of LLMs. These datasets are essential to the pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation processes of these models"
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus neighbors do not discuss specific challenges like data quality or computational demands
- Break condition: If challenges are not addressed, the survey may present an overly optimistic view of LLM development

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding the transformer architecture is crucial for grasping the evolution and capabilities of LLMs
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the transformer architecture, and how do they differ from previous architectures like RNNs and LSTMs?

- **Concept**: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: Multimodal learning is essential for understanding how LLMs can process and integrate different data types
  - Quick check question: How do multimodal LLMs align representations across different modalities, and what are the key challenges in this process?

- **Concept**: Fine-tuning techniques
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning is a critical step in adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and full fine-tuning, and when would each be preferred?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Transformer architecture -> Encoder-only models (BERT) -> Decoder-only models (GPT) -> Encoder-decoder models (T5) -> Multimodal models (PaLM-E, LLaVA) -> Training methodologies -> Challenges and benchmarks
- **Critical path**: Start with understanding the transformer architecture, then explore LLM architectures, followed by multimodal learning and fine-tuning techniques, and finally address challenges and future directions
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing model size and performance vs. computational demands and efficiency; choosing between different fine-tuning techniques based on task requirements and resource constraints
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on benchmark scores without considering real-world performance; ignoring data quality and bias issues; assuming all LLMs are suitable for all tasks without considering architectural differences
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare the performance of BERT (encoder-only) and GPT (decoder-only) on a text classification task to illustrate architectural differences
  2. Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using LoRA on a small dataset to demonstrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning
  3. Integrate image and text data into an LLM to showcase multimodal learning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The survey's treatment of multimodal benchmarks lacks specificity about which models excel at which types of cross-modal tasks
- Claims about architectural categorization assume these distinctions remain clear as hybrid architectures emerge
- The survey doesn't provide novel quantitative analysis of challenges like data quality and computational demands

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Coverage of foundational LLM architectures and their historical progression from BERT to GPT-4
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about training methodologies and fine-tuning techniques are supported by current practice
- **Medium Confidence**: Discussion of challenges like data quality, bias, and computational demands reflects consensus in the field

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Specificity**: Examine model performance across specific multimodal tasks (visual question answering, image captioning, audio transcription) to verify claims about architectural suitability
2. **Hybrid Architecture Analysis**: Investigate emerging models that combine encoder and decoder elements to assess whether the traditional architectural categorization remains useful
3. **Real-World Performance Gap**: Compare benchmark scores with actual deployment performance across different domains to validate whether current evaluation metrics reflect practical utility
