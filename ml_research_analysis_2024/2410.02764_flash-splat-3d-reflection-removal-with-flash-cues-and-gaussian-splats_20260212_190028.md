# Flash-Splat: 3D Reflection Removal with Flash Cues and Gaussian Splats

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02764
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 20.42 PSNR and 0.2868 LPIPS on real-world scenes, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art 3D reflection removal methods

## Executive Summary
Flash-Splat introduces a novel 3D reflection removal method that leverages unpaired flash/no-flash image sequences and 3D Gaussian splatting to separate transmitted and reflected scenes. Unlike conventional approaches requiring tightly aligned flash/no-flash pairs, Flash-Splat captures arbitrary sequences of flash and no-flash images and reconstructs 3D pseudo-pairs to guide separation. The method enforces a linear relationship between flash and no-flash transmitted scenes through Pearson correlation loss, enabling high-quality separation without explicit paired captures. Flash-Splat significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 3D reflection removal methods (NeRFReN, Dong et al.) on real-world scenes while providing superior novel view synthesis and depth estimation for both transmitted and reflected scenes.

## Method Summary
Flash-Splat captures unpaired sequences of flash and no-flash images, then uses 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct 3D representations of transmitted and reflected scenes. The method constructs 3D pseudo-pairs by elevating the problem to 3D space, using separate 3DGS reconstructions from flash and no-flash views. A Pearson correlation loss enforces the linear relationship between flash and no-flash transmitted scenes, while L1 and DSSIM losses handle reconstruction quality. The system trains four separate 3DGS networks (TF, TN, R, β) with alternating optimization between flash and no-flash views, achieving high-quality reflection removal without requiring actual paired captures.

## Key Results
- Achieves 20.42 PSNR and 0.2868 LPIPS on real-world scenes, compared to 10.09 PSNR and 0.7153 LPIPS for NeRFReN
- Outperforms state-of-the-art 3D reflection removal methods (NeRFReN, Dong et al.) on real-world scenes
- Provides superior novel view synthesis and depth estimation for both transmitted and reflected scenes
- Ablation studies confirm the critical role of flash cues in performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linear relationship between flash and no-flash transmitted scenes enables separation
- Mechanism: Flash increases transmitted scene intensity proportionally while leaving reflected scene largely unchanged, creating a predictable difference
- Core assumption: Camera flash is uniform and direct reflections are outside camera's field of view
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method enforces a linear relationship between flash and no-flash transmitted scenes through Pearson correlation loss"
  - [section 3.1]: "The camera flash will increase the intensity of all pixels proportionally... IF ≈ (1 + α)TN + β ◦ R"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related works focus on different cues (diffusion, polarization) rather than illumination linearity
- Break condition: Non-uniform flash illumination or significant secondary reflections in camera's field of view

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: 3D pseudo-pairs provide initialization and regularization for 3D reconstruction
- Mechanism: Separate 3DGS reconstructions from flash and no-flash views create pseudo-pairs that guide scene decomposition
- Core assumption: Flash and no-flash views cover similar perspective ranges for accurate pseudo-pair synthesis
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "we can construct a 3D 'pseudo-pair' by elevating the problem to the 3D space... IRecF and IRecN form a 3D pseudo-pair"
  - [section 3.3]: "We use 3DGS [20] as the 3D representation architecture... We roughly align them via linear transformation"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - most 3DGS works don't address reflection separation
- Break condition: Large viewpoint differences between flash and no-flash captures preventing accurate pseudo-pair construction

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pearson correlation loss enforces soft linearity constraint between flash/no-flash transmissions
- Mechanism: Correlation loss regularizes the relationship between flash and no-flash transmitted scenes without requiring perfect linearity
- Core assumption: Real-world flash illumination is approximately uniform despite imperfections
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "we chose not to use this hard constraint, but use the Pearson Coefficient... Llinearity = − cov(TN, TF)/√var(TN)var(TF)"
  - [section 3.3]: "this relationship between TF and TN should be close to linear, but might not perfectly linear"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - correlation-based regularization uncommon in 3DGS literature
- Break condition: Severe non-linear flash effects or highly non-uniform illumination patterns

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D Gaussian Splatting
  - Why needed here: Provides fast, explicit 3D representation for novel view synthesis and depth estimation
  - Quick check question: How does 3DGS differ from implicit representations like NeRF in terms of computational efficiency and output format?

- Concept: Reflection physics and flash illumination
  - Why needed here: Understanding how flash affects transmitted vs reflected light is crucial for separation
  - Quick check question: Why does flash illumination affect transmitted scenes but not reflected scenes in typical glass reflection scenarios?

- Concept: Pseudo-pair construction
  - Why needed here: Enables separation without requiring actual paired flash/no-flash captures
  - Quick check question: What conditions must be met for accurate 2D pseudo-pair synthesis from unpaired views?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - COLMAP pose estimation -> 3DGS initialization with pseudo-pairs -> 4 separate 3DGS networks (TF, TN, R, β) -> alternating optimization with Pearson loss -> novel view synthesis

- Critical path: View capture → COLMAP pose estimation → 3DGS initialization → alternating optimization with Pearson loss → novel view synthesis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 3DGS vs NeRF: 3DGS provides faster inference and better compatibility with point cloud initialization
  - Pearson vs hard constraint: Soft constraint handles real-world flash imperfections
  - Flash/no-flash ratio: Balancing view coverage with sufficient pseudo-pair construction

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor separation quality: Check viewpoint coverage and flash uniformity
  - Blurry novel views: Insufficient optimization iterations or inadequate Gaussian count
  - Depth artifacts: Verify depth smoothness regularization weight

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with paired flash/no-flash captures to verify baseline separation performance
  2. Vary flash/no-flash ratio to find optimal balance for pseudo-pair construction
  3. Compare Pearson correlation loss vs hard linear constraint on challenging scenes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Flash-Splat be extended to handle scenes with curved reflective surfaces, such as curved glass windows or mirrors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions that "Flash-Splat currently cannot deal with scenes with curved reflective surfaces" and suggests this is an important yet under-explored corner case.
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide any solutions or experimental results for curved surfaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating Flash-Splat's performance on scenes with curved reflective surfaces, or presenting modifications to the algorithm that enable it to handle such cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does Flash-Splat perform on scenes with double reflections, such as thick or double-pane glass?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Flash-Splat currently does not handle scenes with obvious double reflections" and suggests incorporating double-reflection-based cues as an interesting research direction.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide any experimental results or analysis of Flash-Splat's performance on scenes with double reflections.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating Flash-Splat's performance on scenes with double reflections, or presenting modifications to the algorithm that enable it to handle such cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is Flash-Splat to the strength of the flash used in the image capture process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "If the flash is too weak to illuminate the transmission scene, Flash-Splat would not have the necessary flash cues to remove the reflection."
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide any experimental results or analysis of Flash-Splat's performance with varying flash strengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating Flash-Splat's performance on scenes captured with different flash strengths, or presenting an analysis of the relationship between flash strength and reflection removal quality.

## Limitations

- Assumes uniform flash illumination and that reflections occur outside the camera's field of view
- Performance heavily depends on viewpoint coverage overlap between flash and no-flash sequences
- Requires RAW image processing and specific camera settings, limiting practical deployment

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core mechanism: The linear relationship between flash and no-flash transmitted scenes is well-established and consistently validated across experiments
- Medium confidence in 3D pseudo-pair construction: While the concept is sound, the quality depends heavily on viewpoint coverage and alignment accuracy
- Medium confidence in generalization: Results are impressive on tested scenes but may degrade with non-uniform flash patterns or complex reflection scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test with intentionally non-uniform flash illumination to assess robustness of the Pearson correlation constraint
2. Evaluate performance when flash and no-flash viewpoints have minimal overlap to determine sensitivity to pseudo-pair quality
3. Compare against alternative 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, triplanes) to validate the choice of 3D Gaussian Splatting for this task
