# A Comprehensive Analysis of Static Word Embeddings for Turkish

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.07778
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07778
- Authors: Karahan Sarıtaş; Cahid Arda Öz; Tunga Güngör
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: X2Static BERT embeddings outperform other static embeddings in most Turkish NLP tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of static and contextual word embeddings for Turkish, introducing a method to convert contextual embeddings (BERT, ELMo) into static ones while preserving performance. The authors evaluate multiple embedding approaches on intrinsic tasks (analogy, similarity) and extrinsic tasks (sentiment analysis, POS tagging, NER), finding that X2Static BERT embeddings achieve superior performance compared to traditional static embeddings like Word2Vec and FastText. The results suggest that static BERT embeddings can effectively replace computationally expensive contextual models in Turkish NLP tasks while maintaining or improving performance.

## Method Summary
The study trains several static embedding models (Word2Vec CBOW/Skip-gram, FastText, GloVe) on merged Turkish corpora and converts contextual embeddings (BERT, ELMo) to static form using X2Static and aggregation methods. All embeddings are evaluated on intrinsic tasks measuring semantic and syntactic relationships, then used as features in LSTM models for extrinsic NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, POS tagging, and NER. The evaluation framework compares performance across embedding types to identify optimal approaches for Turkish language processing.

## Key Results
- X2Static BERT embeddings outperform other static embeddings in most evaluated tasks
- FastText shows strong performance, particularly benefiting from Turkish morphology
- Word2Vec Skip-gram achieves highest accuracy in sentiment analysis tasks
- X2Static method preserves contextual information while providing computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting contextual embeddings to static ones preserves performance while drastically reducing computational cost
- Mechanism: X2Static method integrates contextual information into a CBOW-inspired static model during training, producing embeddings that maintain contextual richness without runtime overhead
- Core assumption: Static embeddings can approximate the semantic richness of contextual models if trained with proper integration of contextual cues
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We find that X2Static BERT embeddings outperform other static embeddings in most tasks"
  - [section] "X2Static distilled version of BERT embeddings mostly exhibits better performance than the other static embedding models"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for computational cost reduction
- Break condition: If the static embeddings fail to capture nuanced meanings that contextual models handle well, or if the training overhead of X2Static outweighs runtime savings

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Morphology-aware embeddings (FastText) outperform traditional word embeddings in languages with rich morphology
- Mechanism: FastText represents words as character n-grams, allowing it to capture morphological variations and handle out-of-vocabulary words effectively
- Core assumption: Turkish's agglutinative structure benefits from subword information that character n-grams provide
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FastText also showing strong performance"
  - [section] "FastText architecture proves to be useful in languages with rich morphology, which is the case for Turkish"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence quantifying morphological benefit
- Break condition: If the morphological complexity of Turkish words exceeds the n-gram coverage, or if semantic similarity is prioritized over morphological accuracy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Intrinsic evaluation tasks (analogy and similarity) effectively distinguish between embedding model qualities
- Mechanism: These tasks measure semantic and syntactic relationships captured by embeddings through cosine similarity and vector arithmetic
- Core assumption: High correlation between intrinsic task performance and real-world NLP task success
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We evaluate the quality of these embeddings through analogy and similarity tasks"
  - [section] "We assess the quality of the embedding models using both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence directly linking intrinsic to extrinsic performance
- Break condition: If intrinsic tasks fail to correlate with downstream task performance, or if they miss important linguistic phenomena

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word embedding types (static vs contextual)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental difference between embedding approaches is crucial for grasping the paper's contribution of converting contextual to static embeddings
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between static and contextual word embeddings?

- Concept: Turkish morphology
  - Why needed here: Turkish is an agglutinative language with rich morphology, which affects how well different embedding models perform
  - Quick check question: How does Turkish's agglutinative structure impact word embedding performance?

- Concept: Intrinsic vs extrinsic evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses both types of evaluation to comprehensively assess embedding models, with intrinsic focusing on semantic/syntactic relationships and extrinsic on practical NLP tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of word embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Corpus preprocessing -> Embedding training -> Intrinsic evaluation -> Extrinsic evaluation
  - Embedding models: Word2Vec (CBOW, Skip-gram), FastText, GloVe, ELMo, BERT
  - Conversion methods: Aggregate, X2Static
  - Evaluation: Intrinsic (analogy, similarity) and extrinsic (sentiment analysis, POS tagging, NER)

- Critical path:
  1. Train non-contextual embeddings on merged corpus
  2. Convert contextual embeddings to static using X2Static
  3. Evaluate all embeddings on intrinsic tasks
  4. Use embeddings as features in downstream LSTM models
  5. Compare performance across all models

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Static vs contextual: Static offers computational efficiency, contextual offers richer representations
  - Aggregation vs X2Static: Aggregation is simpler but less effective, X2Static is more complex but preserves performance
  - Embedding dimension: Higher dimensions capture more information but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor intrinsic task performance indicates embeddings fail to capture semantic/syntactic relationships
  - Low extrinsic task accuracy suggests embeddings don't generalize well to practical applications
  - High OOV ratio in evaluation datasets indicates embeddings miss important vocabulary

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train Word2Vec Skip-gram on Turkish corpus and evaluate on analogy tasks
  2. Convert BERT embeddings to static using X2Static method
  3. Compare intrinsic evaluation results between X2Static BERT and Word2Vec embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do static BERT embeddings compare to other static embeddings for Turkish languages with different morphological complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that Turkish is an agglutinative language with rich morphology, and that static BERT embeddings performed well in syntactic tasks, but does not compare to other morphologically rich languages
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated static BERT embeddings for Turkish, without comparing to other morphologically rich languages
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing static BERT embeddings for Turkish to other agglutinative languages like Finnish, Hungarian, or Japanese, using the same evaluation tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the X2Static method be applied to other transformer-based models like GPT to generate static embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that GPT models were not included in the study due to the lack of a common method for reducing them to static word embeddings, unlike BERT
- Why unresolved: The paper did not investigate applying the X2Static method to other transformer-based models like GPT
- What evidence would resolve it: A study applying the X2Static method to GPT or other transformer-based models, and comparing the performance of the resulting static embeddings to those of BERT and other static embeddings

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the results of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations differ for other languages, and what factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that intrinsic evaluations were more effective than extrinsic evaluations in distinguishing between different embedding models for Turkish, and cites a study by Wang et al. (2019) suggesting that extrinsic evaluations rely more on sequential information than word meaning
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for Turkish, without comparing to other languages
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for different languages, including analytical languages like English and synthetic languages like German, to identify factors that contribute to differences in results

## Limitations

- Limited computational cost analysis: The paper claims X2Static provides efficiency gains but lacks direct measurements or corpus evidence to support this assertion
- Narrow evaluation scope: The study focuses on a relatively narrow set of Turkish corpora and evaluation tasks, which may limit generalizability to other domains
- Weak correlation evidence: The analysis lacks clear correlations between intrinsic metrics and downstream task performance, making it difficult to assess practical benefits

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The finding that FastText performs well for Turkish due to its morphology-aware architecture, supported by multiple evidence anchors and alignment with established NLP principles for agglutinative languages
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority of X2Static BERT embeddings over other static models, as the claim is supported by experimental results but lacks robust statistical validation across multiple runs
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that static BERT embeddings can effectively replace contextual models without runtime overhead, due to missing computational cost analysis and limited evidence of efficiency gains

## Next Checks

1. **Computational Efficiency Validation**: Measure and compare the actual runtime performance and memory usage of static vs contextual embeddings during inference across all evaluated tasks to verify the claimed efficiency gains of the X2Static approach

2. **Cross-domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate the embeddings on additional Turkish NLP tasks and datasets from different domains (e.g., medical, legal, social media) to assess whether the observed performance patterns hold beyond the current evaluation scope

3. **Intrinsic-Extinsic Correlation Analysis**: Conduct a systematic analysis to quantify the relationship between intrinsic task performance (analogy, similarity) and extrinsic task accuracy across all embedding models, establishing whether intrinsic metrics reliably predict downstream performance
