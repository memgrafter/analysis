# State Space Models for Event Cameras

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.15584
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15584
- Authors: Nikola Zubić; Mathias Gehrig; Davide Scaramuzza
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SSMs achieve 33% faster training and 3.76 mAP drop at higher frequencies vs 21.25+ mAP for RNN/Transformer baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces State-Space Models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters for event-based vision tasks, addressing the critical problem of poor generalizability when deploying event-camera models at higher inference frequencies than training. The authors propose integrating SSMs within a Vision Transformer architecture to achieve both faster training and better adaptability to varying temporal frequencies. Their approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing RNN and Transformer methods, with minimal performance degradation when operating at higher frequencies, while also introducing two strategies to counteract aliasing effects.

## Method Summary
The method integrates State-Space Models (SSMs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for event-based object detection. The approach uses learnable timescale parameters that enable frequency adaptation without retraining, leveraging the LTI properties of SSMs to transform between continuous and discrete-time systems. The architecture includes event preprocessing into dense grid representations, hierarchical SSM-ViT blocks with local and global attention, and YOLOX detection heads. Two strategies for aliasing mitigation are introduced: frequency-selective masking based on state matrix eigenvalues and H2 norm regularization. The model is trained on Gen1 and 1 Mpx datasets using ADAM optimizer with mixed batching strategies.

## Key Results
- 33% faster training speed compared to existing RNN and Transformer methods
- Only 3.76 mAP drop when operating at higher frequencies versus 21.25+ mAP drops for baselines
- Effective frequency adaptation across 20Hz, 40Hz, 80Hz, 100Hz, and 200Hz without retraining
- Two novel aliasing mitigation strategies (bandlimiting and H2 norm) successfully reduce artifacts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SSMs with learnable timescale parameters can adapt to varying temporal frequencies without retraining, unlike RNN/Transformer architectures.
- Mechanism: Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) continuous-time systems represented by SSMs can be transformed into discrete-time systems with arbitrary step sizes. The learnable timescale parameter scales globally based on the ratio between new and old frequency sampling rates, enabling frequency adaptation.
- Core assumption: The underlying event data can be modeled as a continuous-time signal that can be discretized at different rates without losing essential temporal information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies."
  - [section 1]: "State-space models [16] can be deployed at different frequencies at inference time because they are Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) continuous-time systems that can be transformed into discrete-time system with an arbitrary step size."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only 1 of 8 neighbor papers mentions SSMs directly in the context of frequency adaptation.
- Break condition: When the underlying event data contains non-linear temporal dynamics that cannot be adequately captured by a linear state-space model.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frequency-selective masking prevents aliasing by limiting the kernel bandwidth to below the Nyquist frequency.
- Mechanism: The model computes effective frequencies for each state based on the imaginary part of the state matrix eigenvalues and masks states whose frequencies exceed a threshold α. This bandlimiting ensures learned convolutional kernels remain smooth.
- Core assumption: Aliasing occurs when the kernel bandwidth surpasses the Nyquist frequency, and this can be prevented by explicitly limiting the frequency response during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3.1]: "To modulate the frequency spectrum of the model, we define a hyperparameter α, which is used for masking the computed effective frequency fn for each state."
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mention of aliasing mitigation strategies in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: When the optimal frequency response requires passing frequencies above the Nyquist rate for the given sampling frequency.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: H2 norm minimization attenuates frequency response beyond a selected frequency ωmin to mitigate aliasing.
- Mechanism: The H2 norm of the continuous-time state-space model is computed over the frequency range [ωmin, ωmax], and this term is added to the loss function. This suppresses the frequency response beyond ωmin.
- Core assumption: Minimizing the H2 norm in a specific frequency range effectively reduces aliasing artifacts without significantly degrading the desired signal processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3.2]: "This approach makes use of the H2 norm of a continuous-time linear system which measures the power (or steady-state covariance) of the output response to unit white-noise input."
  - [abstract]: "We introduce two strategies (bandlimiting & H2 norm) designed to alleviate aliasing issues."
  - [corpus]: No evidence - H2 norm is not mentioned in any neighbor papers.
- Break condition: When the H2 norm minimization excessively suppresses necessary frequency components, leading to loss of important temporal information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems and their discretization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how continuous-time SSMs can be discretized at different rates is fundamental to grasping why SSMs can adapt to varying frequencies
  - Quick check question: What property of LTI systems allows them to be sampled at different rates while maintaining system behavior?

- Concept: Frequency domain analysis and Nyquist theorem
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding aliasing effects and why bandlimiting strategies are necessary when deploying at higher frequencies
  - Quick check question: What is the Nyquist frequency and why does sampling above it cause aliasing?

- Concept: State-space representation and eigenvalue analysis
  - Why needed here: The learnable timescale parameters and frequency-selective masking both depend on understanding the state matrix eigenvalues and their relationship to system dynamics
  - Quick check question: How do the eigenvalues of the state matrix A relate to the temporal behavior of the system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Event representation → Convolutional feature extraction → Local attention → Global attention → Temporal aggregation (SSM) → Detection head

- Critical path:
  Event representation → Convolutional feature extraction → Local attention → Global attention → Temporal aggregation (SSM) → Detection head

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SSM vs RNN: SSMs offer faster training and frequency adaptability but require careful initialization and bandlimiting
  - S4 vs S5: S4 uses frequency-domain convolution while S5 uses parallel scans in time domain; S5 is more efficient but both perform similarly
  - Bandlimiting α parameter: Higher values (α=1.0) allow more frequency content but risk aliasing; lower values (α=0.5) are more conservative

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation at higher frequencies indicates insufficient bandlimiting or H2 norm regularization
  - Slow training suggests inefficient SSM implementation or poor initialization
  - Inconsistent performance across datasets may indicate overfitting to specific frequency characteristics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train S5-ViT-S with α=0.5 bandlimiting on Gen1 validation set and evaluate at 20Hz, 40Hz, 80Hz to verify frequency adaptation
  2. Compare S4D vs S5 performance on 1Mpx dataset with identical hyperparameters to validate architectural choice
  3. Test H2 norm regularization strength by training models with different ωmin values and measuring aliasing effects at high frequencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of SNNs, including hardware incompatibility issues and compromised accuracy, but does not provide a direct comparison with SSMs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include empirical comparisons between SSM-based models and SNNs, leaving a gap in understanding their relative strengths and weaknesses.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive benchmark study comparing SSM-based models and SNNs on the same event-based vision tasks, including metrics for accuracy, hardware efficiency, and training/inference speed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific architectural modifications needed to extend SSM-based models to other event-based vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on object detection and does not explore the application of SSMs to other event-based vision tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how SSM-based models can be adapted for tasks beyond object detection, leaving open questions about their versatility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the performance of SSM-based models on a range of event-based vision tasks, along with architectural modifications tailored to each task.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different initialization strategies for the state matrix in SSMs affect model performance and convergence speed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various initialization strategies for SSMs, including HiPPO-LegS and HiPPO-N matrices, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of their impact on performance and convergence.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions different initialization strategies but does not empirically compare their effects on model performance and convergence speed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing different initialization strategies for the state matrix in SSMs, measuring their impact on model performance, convergence speed, and generalization to different frequencies.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of core mechanisms - only one neighbor paper supports SSM frequency adaptation claims
- Novel H2 norm regularization lacks precedent in related work and may have unknown practical limitations
- Computational overhead of frequency-selective masking and H2 norm calculations during training is not quantified
- Evaluation focuses primarily on mAP metrics without detailed analysis of how different frequency components contribute to performance

## Confidence
- SSM frequency adaptation without retraining: **Medium** - Well-supported theoretically (LTI system properties) but limited empirical evidence from corpus analysis
- Bandlimiting strategy effectiveness: **Medium** - Novel approach with reasonable theoretical foundation but no precedent in related work
- H2 norm regularization for aliasing mitigation: **Low** - Novel technique with theoretical justification but no supporting evidence in corpus
- 33% faster training claim: **High** - Based on specific architectural advantages of SSMs over RNNs
- Minimal performance degradation (3.76 mAP drop): **Medium** - Strong experimental results but limited cross-dataset validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying the bandlimiting parameter α (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and measure frequency response using spectral analysis to quantify aliasing reduction vs. information loss trade-offs
2. Implement H2 norm regularization with different ωmin values (0.1π, 0.2π, 0.3π) and perform controlled experiments measuring aliasing artifacts using frequency domain metrics (e.g., power spectral density differences)
3. Evaluate model performance across a broader range of frequencies (5Hz, 10Hz, 50Hz, 150Hz) and use cross-validation techniques to assess generalization beyond the specific datasets tested, including analysis of temporal feature preservation at different frequency ratios
