# Advacheck at GenAI Detection Task 1: AI Detection Powered by Domain-Aware Multi-Tasking

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.11736
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11736
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: First place in GenAI Detection Task 1 with 83.07% macro F1-score, outperforming baseline by 10%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-task learning approach for detecting machine-generated text that won first place in the GenAI Detection Task 1 competition. The system uses a shared DeBERTa-v3-base encoder with three classification heads: one for binary classification (human vs. machine) and two auxiliary heads for domain classification from different datasets. This architecture improves robustness across domains and generators by learning fine-grained representations through multi-task learning. The system demonstrates strong performance despite noisy training data and varying text quality, with the two-stage training procedure (freezing then fine-tuning) contributing to stable learning.

## Method Summary
The approach employs multi-task learning with a shared DeBERTa-v3-base encoder and three classification heads: one binary head for human/machine classification and two multiclass heads for domain classification from HC3 and M4GT datasets. The model is trained in two stages: first with frozen encoder weights for 1 epoch (learning rate 3e-4), then with all weights trainable for 1 epoch (learning rate 3e-6). The final prediction uses only the binary classification head with threshold tuning optimized for macro F1-score. This architecture forces the encoder to learn domain-distinguishing features that improve the primary binary classification task's robustness across different generators and domains.

## Key Results
- Achieved 83.07% macro F1-score on test set, winning first place in GenAI Detection Task 1
- Outperformed baseline by 10 percentage points in macro F1-score
- Demonstrated strong performance across multiple domains and generators despite training data quality issues
- Two-stage training procedure contributed to stable learning and improved final performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-task learning with domain-aware auxiliary tasks improves detection robustness by forcing the encoder to learn domain-distinguishing features. The shared encoder is trained on three tasks simultaneously, with auxiliary tasks updating the shared representation with domain-specific information, improving the encoder's ability to distinguish between human and machine-generated texts across domains.

### Mechanism 2
Two-stage training (frozen encoder → fine-tune all) allows the encoder to first learn general domain features before optimizing for the binary task. In stage one, the encoder learns stable domain representations while classification heads are trained. In stage two, all parameters are unfrozen and fine-tuned together, allowing the encoder to adapt specifically for the binary classification task while retaining domain knowledge.

### Mechanism 3
The cluster structure in embedding space improves detection by creating separable regions for different domains and generators. The multi-task learning process creates a cluster structure where texts from different domains form distinct clusters, helping the classifier better separate human and machine-generated texts by exploiting domain-specific patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multi-task learning with hard parameter sharing
  - Why needed here: To leverage domain information while sharing representation learning across tasks
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between hard and soft parameter sharing in MTL?

- **Concept**: Two-stage training (freezing vs. unfreezing)
  - Why needed here: To first learn stable domain features before fine-tuning for the binary task
  - Quick check question: Why might we want to freeze encoder weights in the first training stage?

- **Concept**: Custom classification heads with multiple layers
  - Why needed here: To provide more expressive classification than simple linear layers
  - Quick check question: How does adding depth to classification heads affect the learned decision boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Shared DeBERTa-v3-base encoder → Binary CCH (2 classes) + HC3 CCH (5 classes) + M4GT CCH (6 classes) → Threshold layer for final prediction
- **Critical path**: Input text → Shared encoder → All three CCHs → Binary prediction only used for inference
- **Design tradeoffs**: Multi-task learning adds complexity and training time but improves robustness; two-stage training adds hyperparameter tuning but improves stability
- **Failure signatures**: Poor binary performance despite good auxiliary task performance suggests domain tasks are not helping; cluster structure disappears if auxiliary tasks are removed
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare single-task vs. multi-task performance on dev set
  2. Test different numbers of auxiliary classification heads (1, 2, or 3)
  3. Vary threshold values on binary output to find optimal operating point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal number of auxiliary classification heads for multi-task learning in machine-generated text detection? While the paper provides empirical evidence for different configurations, it does not establish a theoretical framework for determining the optimal number of heads, nor does it explain why the 2-head configuration performed best in the final evaluation.

### Open Question 2
How does the quality of training data affect the performance of multi-task learning models in detecting machine-generated text? The paper mentions that data may be of poor quality but does not provide quantitative analysis of how data quality variations impact model performance, nor does it propose methods to mitigate the effects of low-quality training data.

### Open Question 3
Can the cluster structure observed in embeddings space be leveraged to improve detection accuracy for previously unseen generators? While the cluster structure is identified, the paper does not explore whether this structure can be used for zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to new generators, nor does it propose methods to enhance cross-generator robustness.

## Limitations

- Limited ablation studies to confirm whether freezing the encoder in stage one is optimal or necessary
- Domain classification tasks may act as regularizers rather than providing meaningful features for binary classification
- Cluster structure observed in embedding space presented as beneficial without rigorous validation of its contribution to generalization

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The system achieved first place in GenAI Detection Task 1 with the reported macro F1-score of 83.07%
- **Medium confidence**: Multi-task learning with domain-aware auxiliary tasks improves robustness across domains and generators
- **Medium confidence**: Two-stage training (frozen encoder → fine-tune all) improves binary classification performance
- **Low confidence**: The cluster structure in embedding space directly contributes to detection performance

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on multi-task learning**: Train and evaluate three versions of the system on the competition test set: (a) single-task binary classification only, (b) multi-task with one auxiliary head, and (c) the full multi-task system with two auxiliary heads. Compare macro F1-scores to quantify the exact contribution of each auxiliary task.

2. **Cluster structure validation**: Remove the domain classification heads and train only the binary classifier, then visualize and compare the embedding space structure. Measure whether the cluster structure disappears and whether this correlates with changes in detection performance, particularly on cross-domain test samples.

3. **Generalization test to unseen generators**: Using the trained model, evaluate performance on a held-out subset of human-written and machine-generated texts from generators not present in the training data. Compare this out-of-distribution performance to in-distribution test performance to assess true robustness claims.
