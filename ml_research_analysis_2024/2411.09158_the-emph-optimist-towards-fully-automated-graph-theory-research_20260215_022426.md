# The \emph{Optimist}: Towards Fully Automated Graph Theory Research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.09158
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09158
- Authors: Randy Davila

- The Optimist is an autonomous agent for generating conjectures in graph theory using mixed-integer programming and heuristic methods.

## Executive Summary
The Optimist is an autonomous agent designed for generating conjectures in graph theory through mixed-integer programming and heuristic methods. It constructs a tabular knowledge base of graph invariants and employs optimization models to generate upper and lower bounds on target invariants, focusing on equality instances to identify sharp conjectures. The system applies iterative filtering through Hazel, Morgan, and Smokey heuristics to prioritize empirically strong and non-redundant conjectures. In a case study on the independence number, the Optimist successfully rediscovered classical theorems and generated novel inequalities through an interactive feedback loop with a human counterexample provider. The work demonstrates the potential for automated mathematical discovery and outlines the GraphMind framework, where the Optimist agent collaborates with a Pessimist agent to create a fully automated conjecture-generation system.

## Method Summary
The Optimist generates conjectures by constructing a knowledge base of graph invariants and using mixed-integer programming to find tight bounds on target invariants. The system maximizes equality instances (touch numbers) to identify sharp conjectures, then applies three heuristics: Hazel (prioritizes by touch number), Morgan (removes redundant conjectures), and Smokey (filters by distinct sharp graphs). An iterative feedback loop with a Pessimist agent refines conjectures by incorporating counterexamples, updating the knowledge base and regenerating conjectures until no further improvements are found.

## Key Results
- Successfully rediscovered classical theorems including König's theorem on the independence number
- Generated novel inequalities through iterative feedback with human-provided counterexamples
- Demonstrated effective filtering of conjectures using touch number, generality, and sharpness heuristics
- Validated the potential for automated mathematical discovery in graph theory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) enables the system to generate conjectures that are both sharp (hold as equality for many graphs) and novel (not implied by known theorems).
- Mechanism: MIP formulations maximize the number of equality instances (touch numbers) while ensuring feasibility across the dataset. This focuses the search on tight bounds that are empirically meaningful.
- Core assumption: The equality instances correspond to structurally significant relationships between invariants.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The Optimist is an autonomous agent for generating conjectures in graph theory using mixed-integer programming and heuristic methods."
  - [section 3.3]: "The framework emphasizes maximizing instances where each bound holds as an equality, ensuring conjectures that are not only accurate but also sharp."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus signals about MIP specifically.
- Break condition: If the MIP model becomes too large or the dataset too sparse, the solver may fail to find meaningful bounds or produce trivial results.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Hazel heuristic prioritizes conjectures with high touch numbers, filtering out weak or redundant conjectures.
- Mechanism: Touch number counts how many graphs satisfy the conjecture as equality. Sorting by this metric ensures that only conjectures with strong empirical support are retained.
- Core assumption: High touch numbers indicate conjectures that capture fundamental invariant relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5]: "The touch number of a conjectured inequality is defined as the number of graphs in the Optimist knowledge base for which the inequality holds as an equality."
  - [section 3.5]: "A high touch number suggests that the conjectured bound is not only generally valid but also sharp for a significant subset of graphs."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus signals about the Hazel heuristic specifically.
- Break condition: If the dataset is too small or biased, touch numbers may not reflect true mathematical significance, leading to misleading priorities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The iterative feedback loop between Optimist and Pessimist agents enables continuous refinement of conjectures and knowledge base.
- Mechanism: When a counterexample disproves a conjecture, the Pessimist introduces a new graph. Optimist updates its knowledge base and regenerates conjectures, ensuring they remain consistent with the expanded dataset.
- Core assumption: Each counterexample provides new information that improves the system's understanding of invariant relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The system applies iterative filtering through the Hazel, Morgan, and Smokey heuristics to prioritize empirically strong and non-redundant conjectures."
  - [section 4.2]: "This interactive process continued over multiple iterations, with Optimist generating conjectures and the user acting as a Pessimist by providing counterexamples."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus signals about the feedback loop specifically.
- Break condition: If counterexamples are not representative or the system cannot incorporate new graphs efficiently, the feedback loop may converge to local optima rather than discovering broader truths.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph invariants and their relationships
  - Why needed here: Conjectures are generated by exploring relationships between invariants using MIP models.
  - Quick check question: What is the independence number of a graph, and how does it relate to other invariants like matching number or minimum degree?

- Concept: Mixed-integer programming for optimization
  - Why needed here: MIP is used to find tight upper and lower bounds on invariants while maximizing equality instances.
  - Quick check question: How does introducing binary variables help enforce equality constraints in MIP models?

- Concept: Heuristic filtering and ranking
  - Why needed here: With potentially hundreds of conjectures, heuristics like Hazel, Morgan, and Smokey are needed to identify the most significant ones.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to remove redundant conjectures, and how does the Morgan heuristic achieve this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Knowledge base -> MIP engine -> Hazel heuristic -> Morgan heuristic -> Smokey heuristic -> Pessimist agent -> Theorem repository

- Critical path:
  1. Build knowledge base from initial graphs and invariants
  2. Generate conjectures using MIP for target invariant
  3. Apply Hazel heuristic to prioritize by touch number
  4. Apply Morgan heuristic to remove redundant conjectures
  5. Apply Smokey heuristic to retain conjectures with unique sharp graphs
  6. Update conjectures based on counterexamples from Pessimist
  7. Store new theorems and refine knowledge base

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. conjecture quality: Larger datasets and more complex MIP models may yield better conjectures but require more resources
  - Strictness of filtering: Strong-smokey produces minimal conjectures but may miss some valid ones; weak-smokey is more inclusive but retains more redundancy
  - Dataset size vs. diversity: Small datasets may lead to overfitting; large datasets may be computationally prohibitive

- Failure signatures:
  - No conjectures generated: MIP solver fails to find feasible solutions
  - All conjectures are trivial: Dataset too small or MIP model not properly constrained
  - System generates known theorems: Theorem repository not properly maintained or filtering too weak
  - Slow performance: Large dataset or complex MIP models exceeding computational resources

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test MIP conjecture generation on a small dataset (K2, K3, P3) and verify touch numbers
  2. Apply Hazel heuristic to sort conjectures by touch number and check filtering
  3. Introduce a counterexample graph and verify that Optimist updates its conjectures correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can GraphMind's dueling-agent framework achieve fully autonomous mathematical discovery without human intervention?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper outlines GraphMind as a concept where Optimist generates conjectures and Pessimist searches for counterexamples in a continuous feedback loop, aiming for complete automation.
- Why unresolved: The framework is currently theoretical, with the Pessimist agent's autonomous capabilities (such as deep reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search) still under development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a working GraphMind system where both agents operate autonomously, generating meaningful conjectures and counterexamples without human input.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the Optimist agent's conjecture generation process be improved to better identify conjectures that are not only empirically strong but also theoretically significant?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Optimist uses touch number, generality, and sharpness heuristics to prioritize conjectures, but the paper suggests that further refinement could enhance theoretical relevance.
- Why unresolved: The current heuristics focus on empirical strength and redundancy reduction but may not fully capture the theoretical depth or potential impact of conjectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing that conjectures generated by enhanced heuristics lead to more mathematically significant discoveries or formal proofs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the weak-smokey and strong-smokey heuristics for filtering conjectures to maximize both inclusiveness and theoretical depth?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes weak-smokey as prioritizing inclusiveness by retaining conjectures that introduce new sharp graphs, while strong-smokey applies stricter criteria for minimal, highly informative conjectures.
- Why unresolved: The choice between heuristics depends on the desired outcome—broad exploration versus focused, deep insights—and the optimal balance may vary by research context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of each heuristic in different mathematical domains, identifying scenarios where one outperforms the other.

## Limitations
- The quality of generated conjectures heavily depends on the initial dataset composition and diversity
- Computational complexity of solving MIP models grows rapidly with dataset size, limiting scalability
- Current framework relies on human-provided counterexamples, preventing full autonomy

## Confidence
- High confidence: The MIP framework can generate valid inequalities that hold as equality for multiple graphs
- Medium confidence: The Hazel, Morgan, and Smokey heuristics effectively prioritize empirically strong and non-redundant conjectures
- Medium confidence: The interactive feedback loop with a human counterexample provider improves conjecture quality

## Next Checks
1. Test the MIP conjecture generation on a larger, more diverse dataset including random graphs, bipartite graphs, and graphs with varying density to assess scalability and diversity of outputs
2. Implement automated counterexample generation using the Pessimist agent to evaluate the system's performance without human intervention
3. Conduct a formal mathematical verification of the novel inequalities discovered in the case study to confirm they are not derivable from existing theorems in the repository
