# A Survey of Controllable Learning: Methods and Applications in Information Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06083
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06083
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of controllable learning methods for IR, formalizing CL as task requirement triplet and categorizing methods by what, who, how, and where to control

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of controllable learning (CL) methods and their applications in information retrieval (IR). CL enables models to adapt to dynamic task requirements at test time without retraining, enhancing trustworthiness and user control. The survey categorizes CL by what is controllable (e.g., multi-objective, user portrait, scenario adaptation), who controls (users or platforms), how control is implemented (e.g., rule-based, Pareto optimization, hypernetworks), and where to implement control (pre-, in-, post-processing). It also discusses evaluation metrics, datasets, challenges (e.g., balancing difficulty, absence of evaluation, online environments), and future directions.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews controllable learning methods through a comprehensive literature analysis, categorizing approaches based on four dimensions: what is controllable (multi-objective, user portrait, scenario adaptation), who controls (users or platforms), how control is implemented (rule-based, Pareto optimization, hypernetworks), and where control occurs (pre-, in-, post-processing). The authors formalize CL using a task requirement triplet T = {𝒔desc, 𝒔ctx, 𝒔tgt} and examine evaluation metrics including accuracy, diversity, fairness, and novelty measures. The survey synthesizes findings from various IR applications including search, recommendation, and advertising systems.

## Key Results
- CL enables dynamic adaptation at test time without retraining through control functions mapping task descriptions and contexts to model behavior
- Three main controllability types in IR: multi-objective control, user portrait control, and scenario adaptation control
- Control implementation techniques include rule-based methods, Pareto optimization, and hypernetworks, each with distinct trade-offs
- Standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks for CL remain lacking, hindering direct comparison between methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Controllable learning enables dynamic adaptation at test time without retraining.
- Mechanism: A control function ℎ maps a learner 𝑓, task description 𝒔desc, and context 𝒔ctx to a new learner 𝑓T that meets the task target 𝒔tgt. The triplet T = {𝒔desc, 𝒔ctx, 𝒔tgt} encodes the requirements, and ℎ adjusts model behavior based on these inputs without retraining.
- Core assumption: ℎ can be constructed to generalize across unseen task descriptions and contexts while maintaining the same model capacity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CL enables models to adapt to dynamic task requirements at test time without retraining, enhancing trustworthiness and user control."
  - [section] "Unlike domain adaptation or transfer learning, CL adjusts the model adaptively in the face of new task requirements, eliminating the need for retraining for new tasks during the deployment phase."
- Break condition: If the control function fails to generalize to novel task descriptions or if the context space 𝒔ctx is too large for the model to capture all relevant features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Controllable learning in IR can be achieved through different stages of model processing.
- Mechanism: Pre-processing modifies model inputs, in-processing adjusts model parameters, and post-processing alters model outputs to achieve controllability. Each stage corresponds to a different control function ℎ: ℎ : 𝑓 → 𝑔rule ◦ 𝑓 (pre), ℎ : 𝑓 → 𝑓 ◦ 𝑔rule (post), or ℎ : 𝑓 → 𝑓T (in).
- Core assumption: The IR system can be decomposed into distinct stages, and controlling at each stage does not interfere with the others.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In brief, CL is the ability to find a learner that can adapt to different task requirements without the need for retraining, thereby meeting the desired task targets."
  - [section] "This means that the context 𝒔ctx is editable, i.e., controllable, while in this case, the control function ℎ is a projection mapping that does not alter the learner 𝑓 , specifically, 𝑓 = ℎ( 𝑓 , 𝒔desc, 𝒔ctx)."
- Break condition: If the IR system lacks clear separation between stages or if control at one stage affects the others, making it impossible to isolate the effects of each control method.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hypernetworks provide an efficient way to achieve controllability in IR by generating model parameters based on task descriptions.
- Mechanism: A hypernetwork takes the task description 𝒔desc as input and outputs the parameters for the learner 𝑓, allowing the model to adapt to different scenarios without retraining. This is particularly useful for handling time-varying user preferences or multi-domain recommendations.
- Core assumption: The relationship between task descriptions and model parameters can be learned by the hypernetwork and generalized to new task descriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [corpus] "Hypernetworks, which are neural networks designed to generate the parameters for another network, offer a flexible and efficient way to manage and adapt model parameters dynamically." (Weak corpus evidence, as it doesn't specifically address IR)
  - [section] "HyperBandit [12] utilizes the periodic time information to inject to a hypernetwork, modeling the relationship between user preference with corresponding time block, achieving efficient user preference adaptation during testing stage."
- Break condition: If the hypernetwork fails to learn the relationship between task descriptions and model parameters or if the generated parameters lead to a significant decrease in model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Task Requirement Triplet (T = {𝒔desc, 𝒔ctx, 𝒔tgt})
  - Why needed here: Understanding the triplet is crucial for defining what is controllable, who controls it, and how to implement control. It provides a unified framework for categorizing CL methods.
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of the task requirement triplet, and what does each component represent?

- Concept: Controllability Types (Multi-Objective, User Portrait, Scenario Adaptation)
  - Why needed here: Different types of controllability address different user and platform needs in IR. Understanding these types helps in designing appropriate control methods and evaluation metrics.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of controllability in IR, and what are the key differences between them?

- Concept: Control Implementation Techniques (Rule-Based, Pareto Optimization, Hypernetwork)
  - Why needed here: Different techniques offer different trade-offs in terms of controllability, performance, and computational cost. Understanding these techniques helps in selecting the appropriate method for a given IR application.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of control implementation techniques, and what are the key characteristics of each category?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The CL system consists of a learner 𝑓, a control function ℎ, and a task requirement triplet T = {𝒔desc, 𝒮ctx, 𝒔tgt}. The control function ℎ takes the learner 𝑓, task description 𝒔desc, and context 𝒮ctx as input and outputs a new learner 𝑓T that meets the task target 𝒔tgt. The system can be implemented at different stages of IR processing (pre-, in-, post-processing).
- Critical path: The critical path involves defining the task requirement triplet, selecting an appropriate control implementation technique, and evaluating the effectiveness of the control function ℎ. The success of the system depends on the ability of ℎ to generalize to new task descriptions and contexts.
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between controllability and performance. More complex control methods (e.g., hypernetworks) offer greater controllability but may require more computational resources and may be harder to train. Simpler methods (e.g., rule-based) are easier to implement but may offer less flexibility.
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include the control function failing to generalize to new task descriptions, the context space being too large to capture all relevant features, and the control method interfering with other stages of IR processing.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple rule-based control method (e.g., reranking) and evaluate its effectiveness in improving diversity while maintaining accuracy.
  2. Implement a hypernetwork-based control method and evaluate its ability to adapt to different time periods or user preferences.
  3. Compare the performance of different control implementation techniques (e.g., rule-based vs. hypernetwork) on a standard IR dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What theoretical frameworks can formally guarantee convergence and performance of controllable learning models when adapting to dynamic task requirements without retraining?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for rigorous theoretical analysis to understand structural information in large parameter spaces and causal associations with targets, particularly for in-processing methods.
- Why unresolved: Current CL methods lack formal theoretical guarantees for convergence and performance, especially given the complexity of mapping task requirements to model parameters in large deep learning models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proofs demonstrating convergence bounds, performance guarantees, or formal characterizations of the relationship between task requirements and model parameter spaces for CL methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can controllable learning be effectively scaled to online environments with streaming data while maintaining real-time adaptability and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies scalability in real-world applications, particularly streaming data and online learning, as a formidable challenge, noting that most CL research focuses on offline environments.
- Why unresolved: Existing CL methods are primarily designed for offline settings and require retraining or batch processing, making them impractical for real-time streaming applications where data distributions shift continuously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical demonstrations of CL methods maintaining performance and adaptability in online streaming scenarios with real-time data, showing computational efficiency and stability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks can comprehensively assess controllability across different CL methods and application domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for CL, noting that diverse perspectives on controllability prevent direct methodological comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The variety of control targets (multi-objective, user portrait, scenario adaptation) and implementation methods makes it difficult to establish unified evaluation criteria that can fairly compare different CL approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of standardized datasets with multiple control scenarios and comprehensive evaluation metrics that can consistently measure controllability across different CL methods and domains.

## Limitations

- The survey relies heavily on literature review rather than original experimental validation, making it difficult to assess practical effectiveness of different control methods
- Limited quantitative comparison between different control implementation techniques prevents assessment of their relative performance trade-offs
- Lack of detailed discussion on computational costs and scalability challenges for implementing CL in production IR systems

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The categorization framework (what/who/how/where to control) and formalization of CL as task requirement triplets are well-supported by literature review and provide coherent theoretical foundation.

**Medium Confidence**: Mechanisms for achieving controllability are theoretically sound but lack empirical evidence demonstrating relative effectiveness across different IR scenarios.

**Low Confidence**: Specific quantitative comparisons between control implementation techniques are not provided, making it difficult to assess practical trade-offs and computational costs.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiment comparing different control implementation techniques (rule-based, Pareto optimization, hypernetworks) on standard IR dataset like MS MARCO, measuring both controllability metrics and computational overhead.

2. Test framework's ability to handle novel task descriptions by training control functions on subset of task requirements and evaluating performance on unseen requirements, measuring gap between training and generalization performance.

3. Implement hypernetwork-based control method and evaluate performance as context space 𝒔ctx grows, measuring accuracy degradation and computational costs to identify practical limits for production deployment.
