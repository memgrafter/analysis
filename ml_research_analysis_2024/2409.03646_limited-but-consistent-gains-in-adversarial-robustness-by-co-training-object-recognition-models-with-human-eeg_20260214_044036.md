# Limited but consistent gains in adversarial robustness by co-training object recognition models with human EEG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03646
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03646
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: EEG co-training improves adversarial robustness with correlation 0.53-0.61 between EEG prediction accuracy and robustness gains

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether aligning artificial neural networks (ANNs) to human EEG responses to real-world images improves adversarial robustness. The authors trained ResNet50 models on a dual task of classification and EEG prediction using a large-scale EEG dataset from 10 subjects viewing diverse natural images. They evaluated the models' EEG prediction accuracy and robustness against L2, L∞, and L2 C&W adversarial attacks. Results showed a significant positive correlation (0.53-0.61) between models' EEG prediction accuracy (peaking around 100ms post-stimulus) and their adversarial robustness gains. While the effect size was limited, the gains were consistent across different random initializations and architectural variants.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a dual-task learning approach using ResNet50 backbone networks co-trained on image classification and EEG signal prediction. The EEG dataset consisted of recordings from 10 subjects viewing 16,540 natural images from the THINGS dataset, with 17 channels recorded from occipital and parietal cortex. The total loss function balanced classification loss (categorical cross-entropy) and EEG prediction loss (MSE) with parameters δ1 and δ2. Models were trained using Adam optimizer (lr=5e-6, weight_decay=0.0) for 200 epochs. Robustness was evaluated using Foolbox with PGD attacks (L2 and L∞, 50 and 40 steps respectively) and C&W attack, measuring the mean perturbation magnitude required to fool the model.

## Key Results
- Significant positive correlation (0.53-0.61, p<1e-6) between EEG prediction accuracy and adversarial robustness gains
- EEG prediction accuracy peaks around 100ms post-stimulus onset
- Parieto-occipital channels (PO7, PO3, POz, PO4, PO8) contribute most strongly to robustness despite being less well-predicted than early visual channels
- Limited but consistent robustness gains observed across different random initializations and architectural variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EEG signals at ~100ms post-stimulus onset carry information about object-level features that improve adversarial robustness when aligned with ANN representations.
- Mechanism: During the 100ms window, visual processing has advanced enough to encode higher-level object properties, and these properties are captured in parieto-occipital EEG channels. Co-training ANNs to predict these EEG signals forces the network to develop representations that encode similar object-level invariances, which coincidentally improve robustness to adversarial perturbations.
- Core assumption: The ~100ms EEG signal contains object-level information that is useful for classification and also correlates with robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We observed significant correlation between the networks' EEG prediction accuracy, often highest around 100 ms post stimulus onset, and their gains in adversarial robustness."
  - [section] "We observed significant positive correlation values (between 0.53-0.61, p-values < 1e-6) implying that the robustness of the models scaled with the ability of the networks to better capture the statistics from the neural data."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If EEG prediction accuracy at 100ms does not correlate with robustness gains, or if the EEG signals are primarily encoding noise rather than object-level information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parieto-occipital EEG channels contribute more to robustness gains than early visual channels despite being less well-predicted by the model.
- Mechanism: The parieto-occipital regions encode higher-level visual information that is more relevant for object recognition and robustness. Even though the model predicts early visual channels (Oz, O1, O2) more accurately, the statistical structure in parieto-occipital channels is what actually improves the model's ability to resist adversarial attacks.
- Core assumption: Higher-level visual processing regions encode information more relevant to robustness than early visual processing regions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further teased apart the data from individual EEG channels and observed strongest contribution from electrodes in the parieto-occipital regions. The demonstrated utility of human EEG for such tasks opens up avenues for future efforts that scale to larger datasets under diverse stimuli conditions with the promise of stronger effects."
  - [section] "We observe that mid-level channels (PO7, PO3, POz, PO4, PO8), though not as well-predicted by the ANNs as the early channels (Oz, O1, O2), are better (positively) correlated with the gains in robustness."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If robustness gains correlate equally well with all EEG channels, or if early visual channels show stronger correlation with robustness than parieto-occipital channels.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The dual-task learning objective (classification + EEG prediction) creates a regularization effect that improves robustness through representation alignment with biological processing.
- Mechanism: By forcing the ANN to simultaneously optimize for classification and EEG prediction, the network develops representations that are constrained by both tasks. This multi-task objective acts as a form of regularization that encourages the network to learn features that are more robust and biologically plausible, which incidentally improves resistance to adversarial attacks.
- Core assumption: Multi-task learning with EEG prediction provides a beneficial regularization effect that improves robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Specifically, we trained ResNet50-backbone models on a dual task of classification and EEG prediction; and evaluated their EEG prediction accuracy and robustness to adversarial attacks."
  - [section] "These robustness gains were positively correlated with the ability of the models to predict EEG at early time points."
  - [corpus] Weak - while co-training is mentioned in neighboring papers, none directly address the mechanism of how dual-task learning with EEG specifically improves adversarial robustness.
- Break condition: If single-task classification with EEG-based regularization does not produce similar robustness gains, or if the EEG prediction branch does not contribute meaningfully to the overall training objective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial robustness and attack types (L2, L∞, C&W)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different attack types and evaluation metrics is crucial for interpreting the robustness gains and designing appropriate experiments.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between L∞ and L2 adversarial attacks in terms of how they constrain perturbations?

- Concept: EEG signal processing and channel selection
  - Why needed here: Understanding how EEG signals are processed, the significance of different channels, and the temporal dynamics is essential for interpreting the results and designing the co-training approach.
  - Quick check question: Why were only 17 channels from occipital and parietal regions selected for this study?

- Concept: Multi-task learning and loss balancing
  - Why needed here: The dual-task learning approach with balanced loss functions is the core methodology used in this paper, and understanding how to implement and tune this is critical.
  - Quick check question: How does the loss balancing function in Equation (1) help ensure both classification and EEG prediction objectives are adequately optimized?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ResNet50 backbone -> Classification branch (standard classification head) + EEG prediction branch (Dense/RNN/Transformer/Attention component)

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess EEG-image pairs
  2. Initialize ResNet50 backbone with ImageNet pre-training
  3. Append independent EEG prediction component
  4. Implement dual-task loss function with balancing parameters
  5. Train with Adam optimizer (lr=5e-6, weight_decay=0.0)
  6. Evaluate EEG prediction accuracy using Pearson correlation
  7. Generate adversarial examples and measure robustness gains

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature integration strategy: concatenating vs averaging features from different ResNet blocks
  - EEG prediction component choice: Dense layers vs RNN vs Transformer vs Attention
  - Loss balancing: how to set δ1 and δ2 parameters to ensure both tasks contribute meaningfully
  - Training duration: 200 epochs may be insufficient or excessive depending on dataset size

- Failure signatures:
  - No correlation between EEG prediction accuracy and robustness gains
  - Control experiments (shuffled/random EEG) showing equal or better performance
  - Early visual channels showing stronger correlation with robustness than parieto-occipital channels
  - Model failing to converge on either classification or EEG prediction task

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement baseline ResNet50 classifier and verify classification performance on the dataset
  2. Add simple EEG prediction branch (Dense layers) and train with balanced loss, evaluate correlation between EEG prediction and classification accuracy
  3. Generate adversarial examples using PGD and C&W attacks, measure baseline robustness and establish initial correlation with EEG prediction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific statistical elements of neural activity are the networks utilizing to improve their robustness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that both real EEG and control (shuffled/random) versions of EEG help in rendering robustness to ANNs, and ask "Exactly what (statistical) elements of the neural activity are the networks utilizing to improve their robustness?"
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that EEG data improves adversarial robustness, but does not identify which specific features or statistics of the EEG signal are responsible for this effect. The authors observed that control versions also showed some gains, suggesting it may be general statistical properties rather than specific neural signatures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying different statistical properties of the EEG signal (frequency bands, temporal correlations, amplitude distributions) while keeping other aspects constant, or analysis of which specific features the network learns to extract from the EEG.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would larger EEG datasets collected under more diverse stimulus conditions produce stronger robustness effects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude "Future works could investigate if larger EEG datasets, collected with different stimulus conditions, say from the auditory domain, can similarly help in improving the robustness of artificial neural networks."
- Why unresolved: The current study used a relatively limited dataset (10 subjects, specific visual stimuli from THINGS dataset), and the authors observed only modest effects. The relationship between dataset size/diversity and robustness gains remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training experiments with varying dataset sizes and diversity (different numbers of subjects, stimulus categories, sensory modalities) while measuring corresponding robustness gains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are the robustness gains from EEG co-training due to regularization effects rather than actual alignment with human neural processing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that control versions of EEG (shuffled and random) also showed some robustness gains, and ask "Can we use these over conventional initialization methods to improve robustness of ANNs?" This suggests the effect may be more about regularization than biological alignment.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows EEG co-training improves robustness, but cannot distinguish whether this is because the networks are learning human-like representations or simply because the additional training signal acts as a form of regularization that improves generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison of EEG co-training effects against other forms of regularization (dropout, weight decay, data augmentation) matched for regularization strength, and analysis of whether the learned representations actually resemble human neural representations beyond what would be expected from regularization alone.

## Limitations
- Limited effect size with only modest robustness gains despite statistically significant correlations
- Single EEG dataset from 10 subjects viewing specific visual stimuli may not generalize to other conditions
- Mechanism by which EEG prediction at ~100ms specifically improves robustness is not fully understood

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The observed correlation between EEG prediction accuracy and adversarial robustness gains is statistically significant and reproducible across different random initializations and architectural variants.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that parieto-occipital channels contribute more strongly to robustness than early visual channels, while supported by the data, could be influenced by the specific experimental setup and may not hold universally.
- **Low confidence**: The mechanism by which EEG prediction at ~100ms post-stimulus specifically improves robustness is not fully understood and requires further investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the co-training approach on adversarial examples generated from different attack methods not used in the original study to verify the robustness gains are not attack-specific.
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual EEG channels to quantify their individual contributions to robustness gains and validate the parieto-occipital region hypothesis.
3. Evaluate the approach on a larger, more diverse EEG dataset with different stimulus conditions to assess whether the limited effect size scales with dataset size and diversity.
