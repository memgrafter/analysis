# Keep on Swimming: Real Attackers Only Need Partial Knowledge of a Multi-Model System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.23483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23483
- Reference count: 40
- The KoS attack significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of attack success rate (80% vs. 25%) and maintains lower perturbation levels (9.4% smaller MSE)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of crafting adversarial attacks against multi-model systems when only the final model is accessible for gradient-based optimization. The core issue is that adversarial perturbations designed for the final model may be rendered ineffective by transformations applied by earlier, inaccessible models in the pipeline. The authors introduce the Keep on Swimming (KoS) attack, an iterative method that repeatedly applies adversarial perturbations to the accessible model and re-inserts them into the original input, adjusting for the transformations applied by the initial models. This process ensures that the adversarial modifications survive the entire pipeline.

## Method Summary
The KoS attack is an iterative method that applies adversarial perturbations to the accessible final model in a multi-model system and re-inserts them into the original input, adjusting for transformations applied by initial models. This process is repeated until the adversarial example successfully passes through the entire pipeline, maintaining effectiveness against the final model. The attack significantly outperforms baseline methods in both attack success rate and perturbation magnitude.

## Key Results
- KoS attack achieves 80% success rate versus 25% for baseline methods
- KoS maintains 9.4% smaller MSE perturbation levels compared to baselines
- Demonstrates effectiveness in real-world scenarios with multi-model systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The KoS attack works by iteratively refining adversarial perturbations to account for transformations applied by inaccessible models in the pipeline. By repeatedly applying the perturbation to the accessible model and reinserting it into the input, the attack ensures that the adversarial modifications survive the entire processing chain. This iterative adjustment process allows the attack to maintain effectiveness despite the intermediate transformations that would otherwise neutralize standard adversarial examples.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gradient-based optimization**: Why needed - to compute effective adversarial perturbations; Quick check - verify gradients flow through the accessible model
- **Multi-model pipeline transformations**: Why needed - to understand how intermediate models modify inputs; Quick check - characterize transformation effects on sample space
- **Iterative refinement**: Why needed - to adapt perturbations across multiple transformation stages; Quick check - measure convergence rate across iterations
- **Adversarial example transferability**: Why needed - to understand cross-model attack effectiveness; Quick check - test perturbations across different model architectures
- **Perturbation magnitude measurement**: Why needed - to quantify attack effectiveness and stealth; Quick check - compare MSE values across attack methods
- **Attack success rate metrics**: Why needed - to evaluate practical effectiveness of attacks; Quick check - calculate success rates across different attack scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Initial Models (inaccessible) -> Final Model (accessible) -> Output

**Critical Path**: The attack targets the gradient flow from the final accessible model backward through the pipeline, using iterative refinement to ensure perturbations survive initial transformations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational efficiency versus attack success rate - more iterations improve success but increase processing time. The method prioritizes attack effectiveness while maintaining relatively low perturbation magnitudes.

**Failure Signatures**: When KoS fails, it typically results from transformations that are either too aggressive or non-differentiable, preventing proper gradient-based refinement of the adversarial example.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test KoS on a simple two-model pipeline with linear transformations
2. Compare KoS success rate against standard transfer attacks
3. Measure perturbation magnitude evolution across KoS iterations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical scalability to real-world multi-model systems with more than three models remains uncertain
- Performance against adversarially trained models at each pipeline stage is unclear
- Limited analysis of perceptual quality and semantic coherence of adversarial examples

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| KoS attack effectiveness in specific experimental setup | High |
| General applicability to other multi-model systems | Medium |
| Performance against production-level systems with additional security measures | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the KoS attack against multi-model systems with 5+ models and varying transformation types, including non-differentiable operations.
2. Evaluate the attack's performance against adversarially trained models at each stage of the pipeline to assess robustness.
3. Conduct a perceptual study to measure the visual quality and semantic coherence of adversarial examples produced by KoS compared to baseline methods.
