# A Survey of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in Financial Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.15909
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15909
- Reference count: 40
- This survey systematically reviews XAI approaches for financial time series forecasting, categorizing methods into interpretable models and explainable techniques while emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between interpretability and explainability.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive review of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods applied to financial time series forecasting between 2018 and 2023. The authors systematically categorize XAI approaches into interpretable models (inherently transparent) and explainable methods (requiring additional explanation techniques). The survey emphasizes the critical distinction between interpretability and explainability for appropriate model selection in financial applications, where understanding model decisions is crucial for regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust.

The research identifies key principles of XAI including feature importance, decision rules, visual explanations, and trend analysis. The authors highlight that while interpretable models like linear regressions, decision trees, attention mechanisms, and fuzzy logic offer inherent transparency, explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME provide feature importance insights. The survey calls for more rigorous evaluation of XAI methods and their reliability in financial contexts, where model explanations directly impact investment decisions and risk management.

## Method Summary
The survey employed a systematic literature review methodology following a predefined taxonomy and classification criteria. The authors conducted database searches across multiple platforms including SCOPUS, Inspec, IEEE Xplore, Computers and Applied Sciences Complete, ACM Digital Library, and arXiv using keywords like "explainability," "finance," "forecasting," and "model" along with their alternatives. Papers were filtered through two stages: initial title/abstract screening for finance and XAI focus, followed by detailed review of essential sections to extract XAI information from papers predicting financial time series or trends. The approaches were then categorized into interpretable models and explainable methods, further classified by XAI principles (feature importance, visual explanations, decision rules, trends) and techniques used.

## Key Results
- The survey successfully categorized XAI approaches into interpretable models (linear regressions, decision trees, attention mechanisms, fuzzy logic) and explainable methods (SHAP, LIME) for financial time series forecasting
- A comprehensive taxonomy was developed distinguishing between feature importance, visual explanations, decision rules, and trends as key XAI principles
- The research emphasized the critical need to distinguish between interpretability and explainability when selecting models for financial applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
XAI methods work in financial forecasting by providing transparency into complex model decisions, enabling stakeholders to understand and trust predictions. Interpretable models achieve transparency through their inherent structure, while explainable methods use post-hoc techniques to reveal feature contributions. The combination of these approaches addresses the dual requirements of performance and transparency in financial applications.

## Foundational Learning
- Interpretability vs Explainability: Why needed - Critical distinction for appropriate model selection; Quick check - Can the model's decision process be understood without additional explanation tools?
- Feature Importance Methods: Why needed - Identifies which inputs drive model predictions; Quick check - Are feature contributions consistent across different market conditions?
- Decision Rules Extraction: Why needed - Provides human-understandable logic for model decisions; Quick check - Can domain experts validate the extracted rules?
- Visual Explanation Techniques: Why needed - Offers intuitive understanding of model behavior; Quick check - Do visualizations align with domain knowledge?
- Trend Analysis in XAI: Why needed - Captures temporal patterns in feature importance; Quick check - Are trend patterns stable across different time horizons?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
XAI Methods -> Financial Time Series Models -> Feature Importance/Decision Rules/Visual Explanations/Trends

Critical Path:
Financial data -> Model training -> XAI application -> Stakeholder interpretation -> Decision making

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model complexity vs interpretability
- Real-time performance vs explanation quality
- Computational cost vs explanation depth
- Generalization vs domain-specific insights

Failure Signatures:
- Inconsistent feature importance across similar inputs
- Explanations that contradict domain knowledge
- Poor performance in out-of-sample conditions
- Inability to handle non-stationary financial data

First Experiments:
1. Apply multiple XAI methods to a simple financial forecasting model and compare explanation consistency
2. Test XAI methods across different market regimes (bull/bear markets) for stability
3. Evaluate explanation quality with financial domain experts for validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The taxonomy may not capture all emerging XAI techniques as the field rapidly evolves
- Limited coverage of real-world implementation challenges and performance trade-offs
- Focus on technical aspects with less emphasis on regulatory and ethical considerations specific to financial domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in the categorization framework distinguishing interpretable vs. explainable models
- Medium confidence in the completeness of surveyed approaches given the rapidly evolving nature of XAI research
- Medium confidence in the practical implications drawn, as real-world validation is limited

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the database search with updated keywords to assess comprehensiveness and identify any emerging XAI techniques not covered
2. Conduct case studies applying the proposed taxonomy to new XAI methods in financial forecasting to test its adaptability
3. Survey practitioners in financial institutions to validate the practical relevance of the identified XAI approaches and their reported limitations
