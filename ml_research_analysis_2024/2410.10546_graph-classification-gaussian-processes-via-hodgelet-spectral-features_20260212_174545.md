# Graph Classification Gaussian Processes via Hodgelet Spectral Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10546
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10546
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: WT-GP-Hodge achieves similar or better classification accuracy than baselines on standard graph datasets while being more robust to noise

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for graph classification that leverages Gaussian processes with Hodgelet spectral features. The method addresses a key limitation in existing GP-based approaches by effectively handling both vertex and edge features through a combination of graph wavelet transforms and discrete Hodge decomposition. By converting spatial graph features into spectral features in the Euclidean domain, the approach enables the use of classical kernel methods while capturing the rich structure present in both vertex and edge features.

## Method Summary
The proposed method transforms spatial graph features into spectral features using graph wavelet transforms, then applies discrete Hodge decomposition to separate these features into exact, co-exact, and harmonic components. These Hodgelet spectral features are used as input to a Gaussian process with an additive Hodgelet kernel, where different kernels are applied to each Hodge component. The approach is compared against a baseline that uses the same wavelet transformation but without Hodge decomposition, demonstrating improved performance on both real-world graph classification benchmarks and synthetic vector field datasets.

## Key Results
- WT-GP-Hodge achieves comparable or superior classification accuracy to WT-GP on standard benchmarks (ENZYMES, MUTAG, IMDB-BINARY, IMDB-MULTI, ring-vs-clique, sbm)
- The method demonstrates improved robustness to noise in vector field classification tasks compared to line-graph conversion approaches
- The additive Hodgelet kernel provides better modeling flexibility for edge features by capturing different types of graph structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Hodgelet spectral features enable better handling of edge and vertex features by separating them into exact, co-exact, and harmonic components.
- Mechanism: The discrete Hodge decomposition splits spatial graph feature spaces into three orthogonal subspaces, each capturing different aspects of the graph structure. The exact component captures gradient-like behavior, the co-exact component captures curl-like behavior, and the harmonic component captures topological invariants. This separation allows using different kernels for each component, providing greater modeling flexibility.
- Core assumption: The Hodge decomposition accurately captures the different types of information present in graph features and that these components are meaningful for classification tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we take advantage of the Hodge decomposition to better capture the intricate richness of vertex and edge features, which can be beneficial on diverse tasks."
  - [section 2.3] "We derive our Hodgelet spectral features by concatenating the 2-norm of the preceding wavelet coefficients across each wavelet filter and dimension"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant corpus papers found on Hodgelet features specifically
- Break Condition: If the graph features do not have meaningful exact/co-exact/harmonic structure, or if the components are not separable in a useful way for the classification task.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The graph wavelet transform provides multi-scale spectral features that capture both local and global properties of graph features.
- Mechanism: The wavelet transform applies band-pass and low-pass filters to graph Fourier coefficients at multiple scales, creating wavelet coefficients that capture localized frequency information. This provides multi-resolution spectral signatures of the original features, which are then used as input to the Gaussian process.
- Core assumption: The wavelet transform effectively captures both local and global structural information in graph features, and that this multi-scale representation is beneficial for classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "Wavelet functions, b : R Ñ R and d : R Ñ R, operate as band-pass filters, and scaling functions, a : R Ñ R and c : R Ñ R, are low-pass filters"
  - [section 2.1] "A wavelet filter captures one perspective of a graph, but to obtain a comprehensive picture, it is essential to employ multiple wavelet filters"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant corpus papers found on graph wavelet transforms for classification
- Break Condition: If the wavelet scales do not capture meaningful structural information at different resolutions, or if the transform is too computationally expensive relative to benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using Gaussian processes with additive Hodgelet kernels provides better uncertainty estimates and handles small datasets more effectively than graph neural networks.
- Mechanism: Gaussian processes provide probabilistic predictions with uncertainty estimates, and the additive kernel structure allows separate modeling of different Hodge components. This is particularly beneficial for small datasets where neural networks may overfit.
- Core assumption: The Gaussian process framework with appropriate kernel design provides better generalization on small graph classification datasets compared to neural network approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Gaussian processes can be employed by transforming spatial features from the graph domain into spectral features in the Euclidean domain, and using them as the input points of classical kernels"
  - [section 1] "Gaussian processes (GP) [4], on the other hand, prove to be a data-efficient and interpretable modelling choice... This makes them ideal for small-data scenarios and high-risk decision-making tasks that require reliable uncertainty estimates"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant corpus papers found on GPs for graph classification
- Break Condition: If the dataset is large enough that neural networks can be effectively trained, or if the uncertainty estimates provided by GPs are not needed for the application.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Laplacian and its spectral properties
  - Why needed here: The graph Laplacian is fundamental to computing graph Fourier transforms and wavelet transforms, which are the basis for converting graph features to spectral domain
  - Quick check question: What are the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian associated with in terms of graph structure?

- Concept: Discrete Hodge decomposition
  - Why needed here: The Hodge decomposition separates graph features into exact, co-exact, and harmonic components, which is the core innovation for handling edge features
  - Quick check question: What are the three orthogonal subspaces that the discrete Hodge decomposition produces for edge features?

- Concept: Gaussian processes and kernel methods
  - Why needed here: The method uses GPs with additive kernels as the classification model, so understanding GP fundamentals and kernel design is essential
  - Quick check question: What property must a function satisfy to be a valid kernel for a Gaussian process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph data -> Laplacian/Helmholtzian -> Eigendecomposition -> Wavelet transform -> Hodge decomposition -> Spectral feature concatenation -> GP classification

- Critical path: Graph data → Laplacian/Helmholtzian → Eigendecomposition → Wavelet transform → Hodge decomposition → Spectral feature concatenation → GP classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost: Eigendecomposition is expensive but done once per graph; wavelet parameters add flexibility but increase training complexity
  - Feature dimensionality: More wavelet filters and dimensions increase representation power but risk overfitting
  - Kernel design: Additive structure provides flexibility but requires tuning multiple kernel hyperparameters

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance despite good hyperparameters: May indicate that the Hodge decomposition isn't capturing useful structure for the specific dataset
  - Very slow training: May indicate too many wavelet filters or dimensions, or inefficient eigendecomposition
  - Unstable predictions: May indicate numerical issues with eigendecomposition or wavelet transform

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run on a small graph dataset with only vertex features to validate basic GP classification works
  2. Add edge features to the same dataset and verify the Hodge decomposition improves performance
  3. Test on a synthetic dataset with known divergence-free/curl-free structure to validate the edge feature handling
