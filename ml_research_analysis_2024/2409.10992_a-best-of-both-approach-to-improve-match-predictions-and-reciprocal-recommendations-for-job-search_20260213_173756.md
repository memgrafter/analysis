# A Best-of-Both Approach to Improve Match Predictions and Reciprocal Recommendations for Job Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10992
- Authors: Shuhei Goda; Yudai Hayashi; Yuta Saito
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Achieves NDCG@10 score of 0.1050 with personalized pseudo-match scores, outperforming baselines and non-personalized approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of reciprocal recommendations in job search platforms where matching users with mutual preferences is critical but hindered by extreme sparsity of match labels. The authors propose a novel best-of-both (BoB) approach that combines sparse but accurate true match labels with dense but less accurate match predictions to create personalized pseudo-match scores. These pseudo-match scores serve as training targets for a meta-model that directly predicts match probabilities, achieving superior performance particularly for smaller user segments like relatively inactive users.

## Method Summary
The method trains two base models separately to predict one-sided preferences (company→seeker and seeker→company), then generates dense pseudo-match scores by taking a weighted average of true match labels and base model predictions. A meta-model is trained to predict these pseudo-match scores directly, bypassing the error propagation issues of traditional predict-then-aggregate approaches. The approach allows for user-specific weights to construct personalized pseudo-match scores, achieving better matching performance through appropriate tuning of the weights.

## Key Results
- NDCG@10 score of 0.1050 achieved with personalized pseudo-match scores, outperforming the best baseline (Harmonic Mean at 0.0979)
- Personalized approach shows particular effectiveness for smaller user segments such as relatively inactive users
- Best non-personalized approach (Global α=0.25) achieves NDCG@10 of 0.1021, still outperforming existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pseudo-match scores combine the high accuracy of sparse true match labels with the dense coverage of match predictions, creating a more effective training target than either source alone.
- Mechanism: The weighted average formula (Equation 8) mathematically blends the binary true match labels with the continuous match predictions, where the weight α controls the tradeoff. This creates dense pseudo-labels that preserve accuracy while being available for more training examples.
- Core assumption: The weighted combination of true labels and predictions provides better signal for training than either source independently, even when the two sources have different distributions and quality levels.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "generates dense and more directly relevant pseudo-match scores by combining the true match labels, which are accurate but sparse, with relatively inaccurate but dense match predictions"; [section]: "Our approach generates pseudo-match scores by taking a weighted average of the true match labels and match predictions"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Personalized weights (α𝑐,𝑗) allow the model to adapt to different user characteristics, particularly activity levels, leading to segment-specific optimization.
- Mechanism: Instead of using a global α, the method assigns different weights to different user segments based on their characteristics. This allows the meta-model to prioritize different information sources depending on whether a user is highly active (favoring predictions) or less active (favoring true labels).
- Core assumption: Different user segments have different optimal tradeoffs between true labels and predictions, and these can be captured through segment-specific weight tuning.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "It also allows for user-specific weights to construct personalized pseudo-match scores, achieving even better matching performance through appropriate tuning of the weights"; [section]: "by personalizing the weight 𝛼 as in Eq. (9), our method can flexibly prioritize either the DMP or PtA approaches depending on their effectiveness for each individual user"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The meta-model trained on pseudo-match scores can learn to directly predict match probabilities more effectively than models trained on sparse true labels or through separate preference prediction.
- Mechanism: The meta-model (Equation 10) is trained to minimize prediction loss against the pseudo-match scores, effectively learning a mapping from user pairs to match probabilities that leverages both information sources in a unified framework.
- Core assumption: A single meta-model can effectively integrate the information from both true labels and predictions, and this integration provides better generalization than separate models with heuristic aggregation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "We then train a meta-model to output the final match predictions by minimizing the prediction loss against the pseudo-match scores"; [section]: "Once we have trained the meta-model, we make recommendations of job seekers (𝑗) to the company side (𝑐)"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reciprocal recommendation systems and their sparsity challenge
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the fundamental problem that match labels are extremely sparse due to their mutual nature, which is the core motivation for the proposed approach
  - Quick check question: Why are match labels in reciprocal recommendation systems typically much sparser than one-sided feedback labels?

- Concept: The predict-then-aggregate (PtA) approach and its limitations
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts its approach with PtA, explaining how error propagation between separate models can degrade performance
  - Quick check question: What practical issue does the PtA approach face due to the substantial difference in probabilities between the two sides of an interaction?

- Concept: Meta-learning and pseudo-labeling techniques
  - Why needed here: The proposed method uses pseudo-match scores as training targets for a meta-model, which is a form of meta-learning
  - Quick check question: How does using pseudo-labels as training targets differ from traditional supervised learning approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Two base models (𝑝ˆ𝑐→𝑗 and 𝑝ˆ𝑗→𝑐) trained separately on one-sided preferences -> Pseudo-match score generator combining true labels and base model predictions -> Meta-model (𝑓) trained on pseudo-match scores to directly predict matches -> Personalization layer for segment-specific weight tuning

- Critical path: 1. Train base models on one-sided preference data 2. Generate pseudo-match scores using true labels and base model predictions 3. Train meta-model to predict pseudo-match scores 4. Use meta-model for final recommendations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. performance: The personalized approach adds complexity but shows better results for specific segments
  - Sparsity handling: Balancing between using sparse true labels (accurate) and dense predictions (available)
  - Hyperparameter tuning: Finding optimal α values requires cross-validation and may vary by segment

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance when optimal α values are at extremes (0 or 1), suggesting one information source is clearly superior
  - Degradation in middle activity segments when combining sources that don't complement each other well
  - Overfitting to pseudo-labels if the meta-model is too complex relative to available data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare NDCG@10 scores for different global α values (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) to identify the best non-personalized configuration
  2. Segment users by activity level and test different α values for each segment to identify segment-specific optimal values
  3. Implement personalized α values based on activity segments and measure performance improvement over the best global α approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the optimal 𝛼 values vary for different types of user segments beyond the three activity levels explored (High, Middle, Low)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention the possibility of defining user segments beyond activity levels, such as new versus old users, and discuss the importance of segment-specific 𝛼 tuning.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only explored three activity-based segments, leaving open the question of how optimal 𝛼 values might differ for other potential segmentation criteria.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with additional segmentation criteria (e.g., user tenure, user preferences, geographic location) and analyzing the resulting optimal 𝛼 values for each segment would provide evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would the BoB approach perform in other reciprocal recommendation domains, such as online dating or mentor-mentee matching platforms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that applying the BoB approach with personalized weights to other domains where reciprocal recommendations are crucial could be an interesting future direction.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted solely on job search data, and it's unclear how well the method would generalize to other domains with different characteristics and user behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing the BoB approach on datasets from other reciprocal recommendation domains and comparing its performance to existing methods would provide evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different aggregation functions in the predict-then-aggregate (PtA) approach on the performance of the BoB method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the aggregation function used in the PtA approach, such as the product or harmonic mean, can impact the final ranking performance.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only used the product of the two separate predictions as the match prediction component in the BoB method, and it's unclear how using different aggregation functions would affect the overall performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with the BoB method using different aggregation functions in the PtA component and comparing the resulting performance would provide evidence.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the performance of the BoB method with personalized 𝛼 values compare to methods that dynamically adjust 𝛼 based on real-time user behavior and feedback?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention exploring more sophisticated personalization techniques, including dynamic adjustment of 𝛼 values based on real-time user behavior and feedback, as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation of the BoB method uses static 𝛼 values based on user segments, and it's unclear how well it would perform compared to methods that can adapt 𝛼 values in real-time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing a dynamic 𝛼 adjustment mechanism in the BoB method and comparing its performance to the static segment-based approach would provide evidence.

## Limitations

- The exact feature engineering details and baseline model implementations are not fully specified, which could affect reproducibility
- The method's performance on different datasets and in online settings remains unknown
- The computational overhead of personalization and the sensitivity to segmentation strategies need further investigation

## Confidence

- **High**: The core mechanism of combining sparse true labels with dense predictions through weighted averaging is theoretically sound and well-supported by the evidence
- **Medium**: The personalized approach shows better performance for specific segments, but the general applicability across different user types and datasets requires further validation
- **Low**: The long-term stability and online performance of the method, particularly regarding cold-start scenarios and changing user preferences, have not been evaluated

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the BoB approach on multiple job search platforms to verify generalizability beyond the Wantedly dataset
2. **Online A/B testing**: Implement the method in production to measure real-world impact on matching rates and user engagement
3. **Cold-start analysis**: Evaluate performance for new users with minimal interaction history to assess the method's robustness to data sparsity
