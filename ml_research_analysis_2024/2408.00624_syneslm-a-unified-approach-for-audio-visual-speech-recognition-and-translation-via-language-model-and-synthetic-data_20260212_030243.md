# SynesLM: A Unified Approach for Audio-visual Speech Recognition and Translation via Language Model and Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.00624
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00624
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 15.7% WER on AV-ASR, 43.5 BLEU on VST, and 54.8 BLEU on VMT on How2 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SynesLM, a unified decoder-only language model for three audio-visual language understanding tasks: audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR), visual speech translation (VST), and visual machine translation (VMT). Unlike previous approaches that focus on lip motion, SynesLM processes entire video frames for richer visual context and uses synthetic data to strengthen audio-visual correlations. The model employs a shared backbone with discrete speech-text tokens and a vision-language connector, trained end-to-end in a multitask setting. On the How2 dataset, SynesLM achieves state-of-the-art results, including 39.4% WER in zero-shot AV-ASR on the VisSpeech dataset.

## Method Summary
SynesLM uses a decoder-only transformer language model (OPT-based) with speech and visual encoders to process discrete speech-text tokens and visual embeddings from entire video frames. The model employs HuBERT for speech encoding, CLIP/SigLIP for visual feature extraction, and a vision-language connector (MLP) to align visual embeddings with the shared embedding space. A multitask training approach handles ASR, VST, and VMT with equal data distribution. The model also incorporates a synthetic data recovery pipeline that replaces low-quality visual frames with synthetic images generated from ground truth text using an LLM and image diffusion model.

## Key Results
- Achieves 15.7% WER on AV-ASR task on How2 dataset
- Achieves 43.5 BLEU on VST and 54.8 BLEU on VMT tasks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot AV-ASR (39.4% WER) and visual translation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Using full video frames instead of lip motion provides richer visual context that improves ASR and translation accuracy. The model processes entire frames to capture objects, actions, and scene-level context, which are then fused with speech features via a vision-language connector. This multimodal integration helps disambiguate speech content that might be unclear from audio alone.

### Mechanism 2
Synthetic data recovery improves visual quality and strengthens audio-visual correlation, leading to better model performance. Low-quality visual frames are identified via CLIP-based similarity scoring between frame and transcription. Frames below a threshold are replaced with synthetic images generated from ground truth text using an LLM and image diffusion model.

### Mechanism 3
Multitask training with discrete speech-text tokens and shared language model backbone enables strong performance across ASR, VST, and VMT. The decoder-only LM processes concatenated speech-text tokens and visual embeddings, with special tokens indicating task and language. This unified representation allows the model to learn shared representations beneficial for all three tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multimodal fusion architectures (early, late, hybrid)**: Understanding how visual and audio features are combined is key to grasping SynesLM's design and potential failure modes.
  - Quick check: What are the pros and cons of early fusion vs late fusion in multimodal models?

- **Vision-language pretraining and alignment (e.g., CLIP)**: SynesLM uses CLIP-like encoders to extract visual features and align them with language; understanding this helps debug visual embedding issues.
  - Quick check: How does CLIP learn to align images and text in a shared embedding space?

- **Discrete speech representation and tokenization**: SynesLM relies on discrete speech tokens derived from SSL models; knowing how these are generated and their limitations is crucial for tuning.
  - Quick check: What information might be lost when converting continuous speech features to discrete tokens?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speech encoder (HuBERT) → discrete speech tokens; Vision encoder (CLIP/SigLIP) → visual embeddings; Vision-language projector (MLP) → aligned visual embeddings; Decoder-only LM (OPT-based) → multimodal token prediction

- **Critical path**: Speech/text tokens → LM → output; Visual frame → vision encoder → projector → LM input

- **Design tradeoffs**: Full-frame vs lip-only visual input: richer context vs higher compute; Discrete vs continuous speech: faster LM training vs potential acoustic detail loss; Frozen vision encoder vs fine-tuning: stable visual features vs task-specific adaptation

- **Failure signatures**: ASR WER increases when visual input is random or unrelated; BLEU drops if discrete speech tokens lose linguistic nuance; Training instability if vision-language projector misaligns embeddings

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation: Run ASR with audio-only, audio+random visual, and audio+relevant visual to confirm visual benefit.
  2. Tokenization check: Compare discrete speech tokens vs raw features for a small ASR task to measure information loss.
  3. Vision encoder swap: Replace CLIP with SigLIP or EVA-CLIP to see impact on multimodal performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does SynesLM's performance scale with larger amounts of training data, particularly for the zero-shot AV-ASR task on the VisSpeech dataset? The paper notes that both AVATAR and AVFormer pretrain on the HowTo100M dataset, which significantly improves their performance on AV-ASR tasks, while SynesLM only uses the How2 dataset.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between audio, visual, and text modalities for different tasks within SynesLM, and how does this balance affect performance? The multitask training setup treats all tasks equally, but the relative importance of modalities likely varies by task, which is not explicitly investigated.

### Open Question 3
How does SynesLM's unified architecture compare to task-specific models in terms of computational efficiency and parameter efficiency? The paper notes that SynesLM is a unified model capable of handling multiple tasks, but does not compare its parameter count or computational requirements to those of specialized models for each task.

## Limitations
- No ablation study comparing synthetic data recovery to simply filtering poor-quality frames
- No validation that discrete speech tokens preserve all necessary acoustic information
- Unclear whether full-frame visual processing provides measurable benefit over lip motion alone

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- The unified decoder-only LM architecture can jointly perform ASR, VST, and VMT tasks
- Multitask training on discrete speech-text tokens is technically feasible
- Synthetic data recovery pipeline can be implemented as described

**Medium Confidence**:
- Full video frames provide meaningful visual context beyond lip motion
- Discrete speech tokens preserve sufficient information for high-quality ASR
- The reported benchmark improvements over baselines are reproducible

**Low Confidence**:
- Synthetic data recovery meaningfully improves model performance versus simply filtering poor data
- The vision-language connector effectively fuses visual and audio information
- Discrete speech tokens offer advantages over continuous speech representations

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Visual Input Quality**: Train three identical SynesLM models differing only in visual input: (a) original frames, (b) synthetic data recovery frames, and (c) random unrelated frames. Compare ASR WER and translation BLEU scores to isolate the true impact of visual quality and content relevance on performance.

2. **Speech Tokenization Fidelity Test**: For a subset of the How2 dataset, train two parallel models: one using discrete speech-text tokens as described, and another using continuous HuBERT features concatenated with text embeddings. Compare ASR WER and translation quality to quantify information loss from discretization.

3. **Vision Encoder Architecture Isolation**: Replace the CLIP visual encoder with a frozen lip-only visual encoder (e.g., cropped mouth regions) while keeping all other components identical. Measure changes in ASR and translation performance to determine whether full-frame visual information provides measurable benefit over lip motion alone.
