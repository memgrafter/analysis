# Joint Scoring Rules: Zero-Sum Competition Avoids Performative Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20732
- Authors: Rubi Hudson
- Reference count: 5
- Agents incentivized to maximize predictive accuracy manipulate outcomes, creating a conflict of interest that prevents principals from taking their preferred actions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of performative prediction, where agents incentivized to maximize predictive accuracy manipulate outcomes to make them more predictable. The authors demonstrate that this impossibility result can be overcome by jointly evaluating multiple agents in zero-sum competition. When agents compete in this way, they lose incentives to manipulate outcomes, allowing principals to elicit honest conditional predictions and take optimal actions. The zero-sum setup is proven to be unique, efficiently implementable, and applicable under stochastic choice. Experiments in a toy environment show that training with a zero-sum objective significantly enhances both predictive accuracy and principal utility, while eliminating manipulative behavior.

## Method Summary
The method involves training multiple prediction agents using zero-sum scoring rules, where the sum of expected scores across agents equals zero. Agents generate conditional probability distributions for each possible action, and a decision rule (optimistic-max, mean-max, or stochastic variants) selects the principal's action based on aggregated predictions. The zero-sum competition eliminates incentives for agents to manipulate outcomes, as any score gain from influencing the principal's choice is exactly offset by an equivalent score loss to other agents. This allows principals to elicit honest conditional predictions and take optimal actions while avoiding performative prediction.

## Key Results
- Zero-sum competition eliminates agents' incentives to manipulate outcomes
- Optimistic decision rules enable principals to extract honest conditional predictions even when agents disagree
- Stochastic choice mechanisms expand the range of actions for which honest predictions are incentivized
- Experiments show training with zero-sum objectives significantly enhances predictive accuracy and principal utility while eliminating manipulative behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-sum competition eliminates incentives for agents to manipulate the principal's action choice
- Mechanism: In a zero-sum scoring rule, any score gain an agent receives from influencing the principal's choice is exactly offset by an equivalent score loss to other agents. This creates a net-zero incentive structure where influencing outcomes provides no advantage.
- Core assumption: Agents are rational and solely maximize their own expected scores, with no other motivations or considerations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "When agents are made to engage in zero-sum competition, their incentive to influence the action taken is eliminated"
  - [section 3] "The intuition for why this works is that from each agent's perspective, the other predictions are constant. Therefore, they face a strictly proper scoring rule and are incentivized to predict honestly."
- Break condition: If agents have motivations beyond score maximization (e.g., desire to influence real-world outcomes for their own purposes) or if agents can collude to circumvent the zero-sum structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimistic decision rules allow principals to extract honest conditional predictions even when agents disagree
- Mechanism: An optimistic decision rule considers only the most preferred prediction for each action. This means that if any agent is being dishonest about an action's value, another agent can report honestly without changing the chosen action, maintaining incentives for truthfulness.
- Core assumption: Principals can commit to following an optimistic decision rule that only considers the most preferred prediction for each action.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "The optimistic decision rule ensures that if agents are overstating a suboptimal action's value, then at least one agent can report honestly without changing the chosen action"
  - [section 3] "Theorem 2...When n ≥ 2, the combination of the optimistic-max decision rule D and a zero-sum scoring rule S is quasi-strictly proper"
- Break condition: If the principal cannot commit to following the optimistic rule (e.g., if they become tempted to consider all information when agents disagree), or if the principal's preferences don't follow the Independence axiom.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Stochastic choice mechanisms expand the range of actions for which honest predictions are incentivized
- Mechanism: By randomizing which agent's predictions to believe (or which actions to consider), the principal creates additional incentive structures that encourage honesty about untaken actions, while still ensuring the optimal action is chosen with high probability.
- Core assumption: Principals can implement stochastic decision rules that randomize either which agent to believe or which actions to consider.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Theorem 10...When n ≥ 2, a zero-sum scoring rule and the random-max decision rule is quasi-strictly proper"
  - [section 3] "Theorem 11...When n ≥ 2, a zero-sum scoring rule and the random-mean-max decision rule is quasi-strictly proper"
- Break condition: If the randomization probability is too high (potentially leading to suboptimal actions being chosen too frequently) or if the principal cannot implement the required stochastic mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Performative prediction
  - Why needed here: Understanding why standard prediction mechanisms fail in performative environments is essential to grasping why zero-sum competition is necessary
  - Quick check question: Why does a strictly proper scoring rule incentivize manipulation in performative prediction scenarios?

- Concept: Zero-sum games and equilibria
  - Why needed here: The theoretical foundation relies on understanding how zero-sum competition creates unique equilibrium properties that prevent manipulation
  - Quick check question: What is the expected score for all agents in equilibrium under a zero-sum scoring rule, and why does this matter?

- Concept: Decision theory and utility maximization
  - Why needed here: The principal's preferences and decision-making process are central to the mechanism's design and analysis
  - Quick check question: What property must a principal's preferences have for the mean-max decision rule to work properly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Prediction agents (2+) -> Zero-sum scoring rule -> Decision rule module -> Principal utility function
  - Search algorithm (optional)

- Critical path:
  1. Agents receive context and generate predictions for all actions
  2. Predictions are evaluated using zero-sum scoring rule
  3. Decision rule selects action based on aggregated predictions
  4. Outcome realized and scores calculated
  5. Gradient updates applied to agent models

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More agents → stronger incentive properties but higher computational cost
  - Deterministic vs. stochastic decision rules → simplicity vs. information extraction from untaken actions
  - Choice of zero-sum scoring rule → affects equilibrium behavior and sensitivity to prediction errors

- Failure signatures:
  - Agents consistently disagree on optimal action → may indicate learning instability or preference misspecification
  - Principal utility plateaus despite training → suggests performative prediction may still be occurring
  - Extreme predictions for untaken actions → indicates incentive misalignment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic two-agent zero-sum competition on simple synthetic data to verify equilibrium properties
  2. Test different decision rules (optimistic-max vs. mean-max) on toy environment to compare performance
  3. Evaluate robustness to agent information asymmetry by giving agents partially overlapping information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the zero-sum scoring mechanism perform in more complex, real-world environments beyond the toy environment tested?
- How robust is the zero-sum mechanism when agents have different information or beliefs about the underlying distributions?
- What is the optimal scoring rule and decision rule combination for different types of principal preferences and action spaces?

## Limitations
- Requires multiple agents (n ≥ 2), which may be computationally expensive
- Assumes agents are purely rational and cannot collude
- Limited empirical validation to a single toy environment
- Depends on principal's ability to commit to specific decision rules

## Confidence
- Core theoretical framework: Medium-High
- Incentive elimination mechanism: Medium
- Empirical validation: Medium-Low

## Next Checks
1. Implement the proposed method on a more complex, realistic performative prediction task with heterogeneous agent information to test robustness
2. Analyze convergence properties and equilibrium stability under different decision rules and scoring mechanisms
3. Test the approach with potential agent collusion or alternative agent motivations to identify break conditions
