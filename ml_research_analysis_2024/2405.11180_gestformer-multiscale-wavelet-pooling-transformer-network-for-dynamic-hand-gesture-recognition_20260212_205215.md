# GestFormer: Multiscale Wavelet Pooling Transformer Network for Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11180
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 98.13% accuracy on Briareo dataset using infrared input

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational inefficiency of transformer models in dynamic hand gesture recognition by proposing GestFormer, a novel architecture that replaces quadratic attention with pooling-based token mixing. The model introduces a Multiscale Wavelet Pooling Attention (MWPA) mechanism that leverages wavelet transforms and multiscale pooling to capture long-range dependencies and scale-invariant features, combined with a Gated Depthwise Feed Forward Network (GDFN) to selectively filter fine details. GestFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets (NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo) while using fewer parameters and MACs than traditional transformers.

## Method Summary
GestFormer is a transformer-based architecture for dynamic hand gesture recognition that addresses computational inefficiency through three key innovations: (1) PoolFormer replaces quadratic attention with non-parametric pooling operations, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n); (2) Multiscale Wavelet Pooling Attention (MWPA) applies wavelet transforms to decompose features into subbands, enhances them via depth-wise convolutions, and reconstructs before multiscale pooling; (3) Gated Depthwise Feed Forward Network (GDFN) uses gating mechanisms to selectively preserve fine-grained details. The architecture consists of 6 stages of MWPT blocks (MWPA + GDFN) after ResNet-18 feature extraction and spatial/positional embedding.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.13% accuracy on Briareo dataset using only infrared input, outperforming single and multimodal methods
- State-of-the-art performance on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture dataset
- Uses fewer parameters and MACs compared to traditional transformer models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Replacing quadratic attention with pooling-based token mixing reduces computational complexity while preserving discriminative power.
- **Mechanism**: PoolFormer swaps the attention layer for a non-parametric pooling operation, eliminating learnable parameters and reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Core assumption**: Pooling can aggregate contextual information as effectively as learned attention weights.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We propose to use a pooling based token mixer named PoolFormer, since it uses only pooling layer which is a non-parametric layer instead of quadratic attention."
  - [section 2.2] "PoolFormer [61] exploits a general pooling non-parametric operator to help in basic token mixing... comparable performance when compared with the transformer model with less computational requirements."
- **Break condition**: If the pooling layer fails to capture fine-grained dependencies, especially for small-scale hand pose variations, accuracy will drop despite lower computation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Wavelet transforms enhance input features before pooling, improving the quality of aggregated tokens.
- **Mechanism**: MWPA applies a forward wavelet transform to decompose features into LL, LH, HL, HH subbands, enhances each subband via depth-wise convolutions, then reconstructs via inverse wavelet transform before pooling.
- **Core assumption**: Wavelet coefficient enhancement preserves spatial relationships while boosting discriminative signal.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.2.1] "We calculate the wavelet coefficient of the input features... After the extraction of these coefficients, we separately enhance these features using Depth-wise separable convolution... inverse wavelet transform is calculated from the processed output features, which are given as input to the pooling layer of the PoolFormer."
  - [abstract] "The proposed model also leverages the space-invariant features of the wavelet transform and also the multiscale features are selected using multi-scale pooling."
- **Break condition**: If the wavelet transform distorts temporal continuity or introduces artifacts, gesture recognition accuracy degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Gated depthwise feed-forward network (GDFN) selectively passes fine-grained details while filtering noise.
- **Mechanism**: GDFN applies a depthwise convolution to input, then element-wise multiplies a GELU-activated gating branch with an unactivated branch, controlling information flow to subsequent transformer stages.
- **Core assumption**: Gating preserves subtle gesture cues that pooling might dilute, while preventing oversmoothing.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.2.2] "To transform the features from MWPA block, we follow [64] to apply two modifications in FFN: gating mechanism and depth-wise convolutions... This is formulated by linearly transforming input using depth-wise convolution and performing element-wise product of two parallel features..."
  - [abstract] "Further, a gated mechanism helps to focus on fine details of the gesture with the contextual information."
- **Break condition**: If the gating threshold is too high or too low, the network either suppresses useful details or admits noise, hurting performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Wavelet transforms and subband decomposition.
  - **Why needed here**: The method relies on decomposing input features into frequency subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH) to enhance and reconstruct them before pooling; understanding this is essential for implementing MWPA.
  - **Quick check question**: What does the LL subband represent in a 2D discrete wavelet transform?

- **Concept**: Multiscale pooling and its role in handling scale variance.
  - **Why needed here**: The model uses 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 pooling filters and averages them to capture features at multiple scales; this is key for robust hand gesture recognition under size and pose variations.
  - **Quick check question**: How does multiscale pooling differ from a single-scale pooling operation in terms of receptive field coverage?

- **Concept**: Gated mechanisms in neural networks.
  - **Why needed here**: GDFN uses gating to modulate feature flow; understanding how gating works is necessary to implement and tune this component.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the role of the GELU activation in the gating branch of GDFN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input frames → ResNet-18 feature extraction → Spatial/positional embedding → MWPT block (MWPA + GDFN) → Repeated for 6 stages → Linear classifier
- **Critical path**: Frame → ResNet → Embedding → MWPT (MWPA → GDFN) → MWPT (MWPA → GDFN) → ... → Classifier. Any slowdown in ResNet or MWPT directly impacts throughput.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Pooling-based token mixing reduces computation but may lose long-range dependencies that attention captures.
  - Wavelet preprocessing adds complexity but improves feature quality; can be disabled if speed is critical.
  - Gating helps preserve detail but increases parameter count slightly compared to plain FFN.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low accuracy but high throughput → MWPA or GDFN too aggressive in filtering; reduce depth or simplify gating.
  - High accuracy but slow inference → ResNet bottleneck or excessive multiscale pooling; try smaller kernels or fewer stages.
  - Unstable training → Check wavelet coefficient normalization; ensure inverse transform is numerically stable.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replace MWPA with direct pooling (baseline PoolFormer) to isolate wavelet contribution.
  2. Remove GDFN gating, use plain FFN, to measure gating benefit.
  3. Vary multiscale pooling kernel sizes (e.g., only 3×3 vs all three) to find minimal effective set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of GestFormer scale with larger datasets beyond NVGesture and Briareo, particularly for dynamic hand gesture recognition in real-world scenarios with more diverse lighting and backgrounds?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates GestFormer on two specific datasets (NVGesture and Briareo) and mentions challenges like background variations, lighting, and shadows. However, it doesn't explore performance on larger or more diverse real-world datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on benchmarking on existing public datasets but does not test on larger, more challenging datasets that might better represent real-world conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing GestFormer on larger-scale, more diverse datasets (e.g., EgoGesture, or custom datasets with varied environments) and comparing performance metrics like accuracy, robustness, and generalization across different conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the computational efficiency of GestFormer compare to other state-of-the-art transformer-based models when deployed on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones or embedded systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that GestFormer has fewer parameters and MACs compared to traditional transformers, but it doesn't provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art transformer-based models in terms of real-time performance on resource-constrained devices.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights reduced complexity, it lacks empirical evidence of performance on actual edge devices or comparisons with other efficient transformer variants in real-time scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking GestFormer on embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, mobile platforms) and comparing latency, power consumption, and accuracy with other efficient transformer models like MobileViT or EfficientFormer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Multiscale Wavelet Pooling Attention (MWPA) mechanism be generalized to other vision tasks beyond dynamic hand gesture recognition, such as action recognition or object detection, and what modifications would be required?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces MWPA as a novel token mixer for dynamic hand gesture recognition but does not explore its applicability to other vision tasks or discuss potential modifications needed for different domains.
- Why unresolved: The MWPA mechanism is specifically designed and evaluated for hand gesture recognition, but its effectiveness and adaptability to other tasks remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying MWPA to other vision tasks (e.g., action recognition, object detection) and evaluating its performance, computational efficiency, and any necessary architectural adjustments for different types of visual data.

## Limitations

- The replacement of quadratic attention with pooling may limit the model's ability to handle highly complex temporal dependencies in hand gestures with subtle transitions.
- Wavelet transform preprocessing adds computational overhead and potential numerical instability, particularly during inverse transformation, which could affect deployment on resource-constrained devices.
- The multiscale pooling mechanism introduces hyperparameters (kernel sizes 3×3, 5×5, 7×7) that may require extensive tuning for different gesture datasets or camera setups.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The computational efficiency improvements (reduced MACs and parameters compared to vanilla transformers) are well-supported by the architectural design and reasonable given the replacement of quadratic attention with linear complexity pooling operations.
- **Medium confidence**: The state-of-the-art performance claims on benchmark datasets are plausible given the architectural innovations, but the specific 98.13% accuracy on Briareo with infrared input needs independent verification across different hardware and preprocessing pipelines.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the Gated Depthwise FFN in preserving fine-grained details is theoretically sound, but the actual benefit likely depends heavily on the specific gesture dataset characteristics and may not generalize uniformly across all hand gesture recognition scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study of wavelet preprocessing**: Remove the Multiscale Wavelet Pooling Attention module and replace it with direct pooling to quantify the exact contribution of wavelet decomposition to final accuracy. This isolates whether the wavelet enhancement provides meaningful gains over simpler pooling approaches.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate GestFormer on a third, previously unseen hand gesture dataset (such as SHREC or EgoGesture) to assess whether the claimed improvements transfer beyond the two benchmark datasets used in the paper. This validates the model's robustness to different camera perspectives, lighting conditions, and gesture vocabularies.

3. **Computational overhead analysis of multiscale pooling**: Systematically vary the number and sizes of pooling kernels (test configurations with only 3×3, combinations of two sizes, and the full three-size approach) to identify the minimum effective configuration that maintains performance while reducing computational cost. This determines whether all three kernel sizes are necessary for the reported results.
