# Interpretability of Language Models via Task Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06441
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06441
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces linguistic task spaces for interpreting language model processing through similarity probing and gradient analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for interpreting language model processing by examining connections between linguistic tasks through task spaces. The authors introduce similarity probing to estimate linguistic similarity and fine-tuning via gradient differentials (FTGD) to disentangle task representations. The methodology reveals that larger models exhibit better generalization to overarching linguistic concepts, while pre-training leads to more distributed processing through increased parameter sharing.

## Method Summary
The core methodology combines similarity probing with transfer learning to estimate linguistic similarity between task pairs. This is achieved through correlation analysis of minimal pair differences in gradients. The FTGD method uses gradient differentials to fine-tune models for specific linguistic tasks, allowing researchers to disentangle and examine task-specific representations. The approach provides a systematic way to map relationships between language phenomena and analyze how models process different linguistic features.

## Key Results
- Larger models demonstrate superior generalization to overarching linguistic concepts
- Pre-training leads to more distributed processing through increased parameter sharing
- Generalization patterns remain stable throughout training without major shifts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the principle that linguistic tasks share underlying representations that can be systematically analyzed through gradient-based similarity measures. By examining how models transfer knowledge between related tasks, researchers can identify the core linguistic features that drive model behavior. The gradient differentials capture subtle differences in task processing, revealing how models separate and combine linguistic phenomena during inference.

## Foundational Learning
- Gradient-based similarity analysis: Measures task relationships through parameter gradients - needed to quantify linguistic similarity, check via correlation with human judgments
- Transfer learning correlation: Examines knowledge transfer between tasks - needed to identify shared linguistic features, check via task pair performance
- Minimal pair methodology: Uses controlled task variations - needed to isolate specific linguistic phenomena, check via ablation studies
- Task space construction: Maps linguistic relationships in high-dimensional space - needed to visualize task interconnections, check via dimensionality reduction
- Parameter sharing analysis: Examines how pre-training affects representation distribution - needed to understand pre-training effects, check via parameter importance metrics

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Language models -> Task spaces -> Similarity probing -> FTGD fine-tuning -> Interpretability analysis
- Critical path: Model training → Task space construction → Similarity estimation → Gradient analysis → Interpretability insights
- Design tradeoffs: Computational cost of similarity probing vs. interpretability gains; granularity of task spaces vs. generalization
- Failure signatures: Poor similarity estimates from task selection bias; unstable gradient differentials from noisy data
- First experiments: 1) Validate similarity probing on controlled synthetic tasks, 2) Test FTGD on single linguistic feature, 3) Compare task spaces across model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation scope remains limited, with uncertainty about generalizability beyond examined task pairs
- Gradient analysis approach may be sensitive to task selection bias and quality of minimal pairs
- Claims about distributed representations require validation across diverse model architectures beyond tested transformers

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodological framework and implementation details
- Medium confidence in transfer learning correlation patterns due to specific task choices
- Medium confidence in pre-training distribution findings pending broader architecture validation
- Low confidence in generalization stability claims given limited training checkpoint analysis

## Next Checks
1. Replicate similarity probing framework across multiple task taxonomies to verify robustness of linguistic similarity estimates
2. Test FTGD method on additional model architectures (RNNs, CNNs) to confirm parameter sharing generalization findings
3. Conduct longitudinal studies with more frequent training checkpoints to validate stability of generalization patterns throughout training
