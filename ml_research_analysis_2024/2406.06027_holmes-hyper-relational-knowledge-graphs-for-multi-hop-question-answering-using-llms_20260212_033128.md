# HOLMES: Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs for Multi-hop Question Answering using LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06027
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06027
- Reference count: 27
- Reduces reader LLM token load by up to 67% while improving accuracy

## Executive Summary
HOLMES introduces a hyper-relational knowledge graph (KG) approach for multi-hop question answering (MHQA) using LLMs. It constructs a context-aware KG from supporting documents, then prunes it using a query-aligned schema to retain only relevant facts. This structured, query-focused input reduces the reader LLM's token load by up to 67% compared to the state-of-the-art, while improving accuracy. Experiments on HotpotQA and MuSiQue datasets show consistent gains in Exact Match (EM), F1, BERTScore, and Human Evaluation, outperforming existing methods. The method also enables self-aware predictions, allowing the model to decline uncertain answers.

## Method Summary
HOLMES constructs a hyper-relational knowledge graph from supporting documents to answer multi-hop questions. The system first creates a KG that captures entity relationships and facts from the context. It then prunes this graph using a query-aligned schema to retain only the most relevant information. The pruned KG serves as input to a reader LLM, significantly reducing the token load while maintaining or improving accuracy. The approach includes mechanisms for self-aware prediction, allowing the model to decline answering when confidence is low.

## Key Results
- Reduces reader LLM token load by up to 67% compared to state-of-the-art
- Improves Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores on HotpotQA and MuSiQue datasets
- Enables self-aware predictions with ability to decline uncertain answers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HOLMES works by structuring the reasoning process through hyper-relational knowledge graphs. By pruning irrelevant information and focusing only on query-aligned facts, the approach reduces the cognitive load on the reader LLM. This structured input allows the LLM to reason more efficiently about multi-hop relationships, leading to improved accuracy while processing fewer tokens. The query-aligned schema acts as a filter that maintains critical information while eliminating noise.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs**: Represent entities with multiple typed relations between them; needed to capture complex relationships in supporting documents; quick check: can represent "A lives in B, which is the capital of C"
- **Query-aligned Schema Pruning**: Technique to filter KG based on question relevance; needed to reduce token load while preserving critical information; quick check: removes nodes/edges not contributing to answer
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Process of connecting information across multiple steps; needed for complex questions requiring intermediate facts; quick check: can answer "X is related to Y through Z"
- **Self-aware Prediction**: Model's ability to decline answering when uncertain; needed for reliability in real-world applications; quick check: returns "I don't know" for ambiguous questions
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Process of extracting entities and relations from text; needed to transform unstructured documents into structured reasoning substrate; quick check: converts paragraphs into entity-relationship triples
- **Token Load Optimization**: Reducing input size to LLMs; needed to improve efficiency and reduce computational costs; quick check: measures input token reduction percentage

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Collection -> KG Construction -> Query-aligned Pruning -> Reader LLM -> Answer Generation

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are KG Construction and Query-aligned Pruning, as errors here directly impact the quality of information fed to the reader LLM. The Reader LLM's performance depends entirely on the pruned KG's quality and relevance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: HOLMES trades computational overhead in KG construction and pruning for reduced token load during inference. This upfront cost is offset by faster LLM processing and potentially lower inference costs. The self-aware mechanism adds complexity but improves reliability.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor KG construction leads to missing critical facts
- Aggressive pruning removes necessary information
- Query misalignment results in irrelevant facts being retained
- Reader LLM struggles with the hyper-relational format
- Self-aware mechanism is too conservative, declining valid questions

**First Experiments**:
1. Test KG construction on a small set of documents to verify entity and relation extraction
2. Evaluate pruning effectiveness by comparing pruned vs. full KG on simple questions
3. Assess reader LLM performance with pruned KG input on single-hop questions before scaling to multi-hop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- May not generalize well to more complex question types beyond those tested
- Scalability of pruning process for larger datasets remains uncertain
- Potential for overfitting to specific KG structure used
- Reliance on specific supporting documents may limit broader knowledge handling

## Confidence
- **Token load reduction claims**: High - directly supported by experimental results
- **Accuracy improvements**: High - demonstrated across multiple metrics and datasets
- **Generalizability**: Medium - requires testing on more diverse datasets and question types
- **Scalability**: Medium - needs evaluation on larger datasets
- **Self-aware mechanism effectiveness**: Medium - qualitative benefits need more quantitative validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the HOLMES approach on additional datasets with more complex question types to assess its generalizability.
2. Evaluate the scalability of the pruning process for larger datasets to ensure it remains effective.
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of each component of the HOLMES pipeline on overall performance.
