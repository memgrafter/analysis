# Multi-label Zero-Shot Audio Classification with Temporal Attention

## Quick Facts

- Introduces temporal attention mechanism for multi-label zero-shot audio classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-label zero-shot audio classification by introducing a temporal attention mechanism that assigns importance weights to audio segments based on their acoustic and semantic compatibility. The approach divides audio clips into segments and uses attention to focus on the most relevant portions for each sound class, improving upon clip-level feature aggregation methods. Evaluated on a subset of AudioSet with 333 classes, the method demonstrates significant improvements in both micro and macro F1-scores compared to baseline approaches across three experimental settings.

## Method Summary
The proposed method processes 10-second audio clips by dividing them into 1-second segments, extracting VGGish embeddings for each segment, and computing compatibility scores with semantic embeddings of class labels. Temporal attention is applied per class to weigh segments based on their acoustic-semantic compatibility, with results fused with uniform aggregation. The model uses BERT for semantic embeddings and is trained with a ranking-based hinge loss that emphasizes classes with higher predicted scores. The approach is evaluated using 3-fold cross-validation with disjoint class sets between folds.

## Key Results
- Temporal attention significantly outperforms uniform aggregation baseline in micro and macro F1-scores
- The method effectively handles class imbalance, showing better macro F1 improvement than baseline
- Results demonstrate promise for zero-shot sound event detection by focusing on relevant segments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal attention assigns higher weights to audio segments that are acoustically and semantically compatible with a target class, enabling multi-label zero-shot classification by isolating relevant segments per class.
- Mechanism: The model computes per-segment similarity scores between projected acoustic embeddings and semantic embeddings, then normalizes these with softmax to derive attention weights. These weights are used to aggregate scores per class, allowing the model to focus on segments where each class is most active.
- Core assumption: Different sound classes in a multi-label audio clip dominate different time segments, and this temporal separation can be learned from acoustic-semantic compatibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "temporal attention mechanism assigns importance weights to different audio segments based on their acoustic and semantic compatibility, thus enabling the model to capture the varying dominance of different sound classes within an audio sample"
  - [section 2.2] "Temporal attention allows learning multiple classes within an audio sample by estimating their temporal attention weights"
- Break condition: If multiple classes are simultaneously active in the same segment, or if the semantic embedding model cannot capture class-specific acoustic characteristics, attention may become noisy and degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining global (clip-level) and local (segment-level) features via weighted fusion improves zero-shot classification accuracy compared to using only uniform aggregation.
- Mechanism: The model fuses temporally weighted scores (ˆy) with uniformly aggregated scores (ˆz) using a mixing parameter γ. This balances the local discriminative power of attention with the global context provided by uniform aggregation.
- Core assumption: Both segment-specific information (via attention) and overall acoustic patterns (via uniform aggregation) contribute complementary signals for accurate class prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "To capture both global and local features, we obtain the prediction score ˆp of a sound event class by fusing ˆy and ˆz as ˆpc = γˆyc + (1 − γ)ˆzc"
- Break condition: If the uniform aggregation baseline already captures sufficient global context, the added complexity of temporal attention may yield diminishing returns or even degrade performance if attention weights are poorly estimated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ranking-based hinge loss with approximate rank weighting encourages the model to push positive classes above negatives in a class-specific order, improving multi-label zero-shot classification performance.
- Mechanism: The loss function uses a hinge penalty to ensure positive class scores exceed negative ones by a margin, with a weighting term β(iyc) that prioritizes classes with higher predicted scores, mimicking a ranking task.
- Core assumption: In multi-label settings, some classes are more confidently predicted than others; emphasizing higher-ranked classes during training leads to better overall performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "We use a ranking penalty to consider the loss values in a weighted manner giving greater importance to classes with higher predicted scores"
- Break condition: If class scores are poorly calibrated or the ranking penalty overfits to training folds, the loss may push the model toward unstable or biased predictions in unseen classes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot learning via semantic embeddings
  - Why needed here: The method must classify unseen audio classes without explicit training data by transferring knowledge from seen classes using semantic class descriptions.
  - Quick check question: How does the model know which unseen class a new audio belongs to if it was never trained on that class's data?

- Concept: Multi-label classification and temporal segmentation
  - Why needed here: Audio clips contain multiple overlapping sounds; dividing them into segments allows the model to assign different attention per class and segment.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we just use a single clip-level embedding for multi-label classification?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and softmax normalization
  - Why needed here: Temporal attention needs to assign segment importance per class, and softmax ensures the weights sum to one per class across segments.
  - Quick check question: What would happen if we didn't normalize attention weights with softmax?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input audio -> 10s clip -> 1s segments -> log-mel spectrograms -> VGGish -> 128-dim embeddings -> fc(tanh) -> shared Dmodel space -> compatibility (dot product) -> attention weights (softmax) -> weighted sum + uniform sum -> fused prediction

- Critical path:
  audio → VGGish → fc(tanh) → compatibility → attention → aggregation → prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Segment length (1s) vs. resolution: shorter segments may better isolate events but reduce acoustic context
  - Number of projection layers: deeper networks may improve alignment but risk overfitting with small data
  - Mixing weight γ: too high favors local attention, too low ignores segment-specific cues

- Failure signatures:
  - Uniform attention weights → attention module failed to learn
  - Extremely low macro F1 but high micro F1 → model biased toward frequent classes
  - Prediction scores near zero for all classes → semantic embeddings not aligned with acoustics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace temporal attention with uniform aggregation (γ=0) to confirm improvement baseline
  2. Vary segment length (0.5s, 2s) to assess temporal resolution impact
  3. Test with different semantic embeddings (e.g., sentence-BERT) to measure embedding sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but leaves several important areas unexplored, including the model's performance on real-world noisy audio data, its applicability to continuous audio streams, and the sensitivity of performance to different segment lengths and temporal resolutions.

## Limitations
- Evaluation constrained to a subset of AudioSet with 333 classes, limiting generalizability
- Fixed 1-second segment length may not optimally capture all sound events with varying temporal dynamics
- Performance gap between micro and macro F1-scores suggests potential bias toward frequent classes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of temporal attention assigning segment importance based on acoustic-semantic compatibility is well-supported by the results, showing consistent improvements across multiple experimental settings.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of combining global and local features through weighted fusion is demonstrated, but the optimal mixing parameter γ and its sensitivity to dataset characteristics remain unclear.
- **Medium confidence**: The ranking-based hinge loss with approximate rank weighting shows promise, but the specific implementation details of the weighting function are not fully specified.

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation fidelity check**: Reconstruct the exact 3-fold split using the greedy algorithm described, ensuring strict class disjointness between folds, to verify if performance differences stem from data partitioning rather than model architecture.

2. **Segment length sensitivity analysis**: Systematically evaluate model performance across varying segment lengths (0.5s, 1s, 2s) to determine the optimal temporal resolution for capturing diverse sound events and assess whether improvements generalize beyond the fixed 1-second setting.

3. **Embedding model ablation**: Replace BERT with alternative semantic embedding models (e.g., sentence-BERT or GloVe-based approaches) to quantify the contribution of semantic encoder choice to overall performance and test robustness to different text representations of class labels.
