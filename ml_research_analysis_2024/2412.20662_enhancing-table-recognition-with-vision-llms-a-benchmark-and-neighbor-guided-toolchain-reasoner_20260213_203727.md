## Executive Summary
This study addresses the under-explored challenge of table recognition using Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) in a training-free paradigm. A hierarchical benchmark is introduced to evaluate VLLMs' recognition capabilities across multiple granularities, including cell, row, column, and table-level tasks. Experimental analysis reveals that low-quality input images significantly hinder VLLM performance. To address this, the Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework is proposed, integrating lightweight image preprocessing tools, similarity-based neighbor retrieval, and a reflection-driven tool selection module to enhance input image quality. Extensive experiments on SciTSR, PubTabNet, and WTW datasets demonstrate that NGTR significantly improves VLLM-based table recognition performance, achieving up to 10.57% improvements over baseline methods. The benchmark and framework provide a novel approach to advancing table recognition with VLLMs.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a hierarchical benchmark to evaluate VLLM table recognition across multiple granularities (cell, row, column, table-level). The Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework is proposed to address the bottleneck of low-quality input images. NGTR integrates lightweight image preprocessing tools (border enhancement, upscaling, noise reduction, binarization, detection/cropping), a similarity-based neighbor retrieval module using ORB features and Hamming distance, and a reflection-driven tool selection module. The framework retrieves similar images from training data to guide tool invocation plans, then uses reflection to verify and refine the selected tools. Experiments compare NGTR against six VLLM baselines across three datasets using TEDS and TEDS-Struct metrics for table recognition and accuracy/F1-score for hierarchical tasks.

## Key Results
- Low-quality input images significantly hinder VLLM table recognition performance
- NGTR framework improves VLLM-based table recognition by up to 10.57% over baseline methods
- The hierarchical benchmark reveals performance gaps at different table granularities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Image quality is the bottleneck for VLLM table recognition performance
- Mechanism: Low-quality images reduce the effectiveness of both OCR and visual understanding, impairing VLLM ability to accurately parse tables
- Core assumption: VLLMs rely on both text recognition and structural understanding, so degraded image quality impacts both
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental analysis reveals that low-quality input images significantly hinder VLLM performance."
  - [section] "Through in-depth evaluations, we identify a critical bottleneck: low-quality input images significantly hinder the table recognition capabilities of the evaluated VLLMs."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations; supports general topic relevance
- Break condition: If VLLM can be fine-tuned on low-quality images or uses internal enhancement, this bottleneck may not apply

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neighbor-guided tool selection improves image quality for table recognition
- Mechanism: Similar images processed with successful toolchains suggest a viable processing plan; reflection module filters ineffective tools
- Core assumption: Images with similar visual features respond similarly to preprocessing tools
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose the Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework, which is characterized by integrating diverse lightweight tools for visual operations aimed at mitigating issues with low-quality images."
  - [section] "we retrieve a similar neighbor from the training data and use the experience gained from that neighbor to guide the generation of tool invocation plans."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations; supports general topic relevance
- Break condition: If similarity measure fails or tool catalog is insufficient, the approach degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical benchmark tasks expose VLLM limitations at different table granularities
- Mechanism: Structured tasks at cell, row, column, and table levels reveal performance gaps in specific recognition capabilities
- Core assumption: Granular tasks can isolate weaknesses that overall metrics may hide
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A hierarchical benchmark is introduced to evaluate VLLMs' recognition capabilities across multiple granularities, including cell, row, column, and table-level tasks."
  - [section] "We design several hierarchical recognition tasks to conduct a more in-depth assessment of VLLMs' table recognition capability."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations; supports general topic relevance
- Break condition: If tasks are too narrow or imbalanced, they may not reflect real-world use cases

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tree-edit distance similarity metric (TEDS)
  - Why needed here: TEDS quantifies how well generated table markup matches the ground truth, essential for benchmarking VLLM output
  - Quick check question: Given two HTML table strings, can you compute TEDS manually on a small example?

- Concept: ORB feature matching and Hamming distance
  - Why needed here: Used to find similar images in the training set for neighbor retrieval
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Hamming distance and Euclidean distance in feature matching?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: Encourages VLLMs to plan tool usage and verify image quality step-by-step
  - Quick check question: How does adding "think step by step" to a prompt change VLLM outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → similarity-based neighbor retrieval → tool plan generation → tool execution → reflection module → VLLM table recognition
- Critical path: Image → similarity-based neighbor → plan generation → tool application → reflection → final VLLM output
- Design tradeoffs: More tools increase flexibility but add execution overhead; fewer tools simplify but may miss edge cases
- Failure signatures: No neighbor found → random tool plan; poor reflection → image degradation; VLLM fails to parse HTML → invalid output
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test neighbor retrieval accuracy on PubTabNet with known similar pairs
  2. Benchmark single-tool vs. multi-tool preprocessing impact on TEDS scores
  3. Evaluate reflection module by comparing with and without it on low-quality images

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between toolchain length and performance in the NGTR framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that a moderate toolchain length achieves an adequate balance between complexity and performance, as excessive toolchain length increases combinatorial complexity and limits processing performance
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific data on how different toolchain lengths affect performance, nor does it offer a clear threshold for optimal length
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying toolchain lengths and measuring their impact on performance metrics like TEDS scores would help determine the optimal balance

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the NGTR framework handle tables with numerous empty cells and unevenly distributed text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that VLLMs tend to ignore cells lacking semantic content, which can limit their ability to capture the structural information of tables with many blank cells
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific strategies or results for handling such challenging table structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the NGTR framework's performance on datasets with tables containing many empty cells and unevenly distributed text would demonstrate its effectiveness in these scenarios

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of table size on the performance of VLLMs in table recognition tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of table size on performance, noting that larger tables introduce longer context lengths, which can affect VLLM performance
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis or data on how different table sizes specifically impact performance metrics
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with tables of varying sizes and measuring performance metrics like TEDS scores would help quantify the impact of table size on VLLM performance

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on the quality and diversity of training data for neighbor retrieval
- Computational overhead from neighbor retrieval and reflection processes may limit scalability
- Framework effectiveness may diminish if neighbor dataset lacks sufficient variety or reflection module fails to identify suboptimal tools

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The benchmark design and its ability to expose VLLM limitations at different table granularities
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the NGTR framework in improving VLLM performance, as it relies on specific implementation details and dataset characteristics
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of the framework to other vision-language tasks beyond table recognition, as the study focuses exclusively on this domain

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's robustness by evaluating it on a broader range of image quality degradation types not covered in the current datasets
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the neighbor retrieval, tool invocation, and reflection modules to overall performance
3. Compare the NGTR framework's performance against fine-tuned VLLM models to assess whether the training-free approach is competitive in resource-constrained scenarios
