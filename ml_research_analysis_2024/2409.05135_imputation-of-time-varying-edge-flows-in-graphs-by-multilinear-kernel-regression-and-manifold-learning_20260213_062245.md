# Imputation of Time-varying Edge Flows in Graphs by Multilinear Kernel Regression and Manifold Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.05135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05135
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: MultiL-KRIM achieves lower MAE than FlowSSL and S-VAR on Cherry Hills water network and Sioux Falls transportation network datasets by incorporating graph topology via Hodge Laplacians and using multilinear kernel regression with manifold learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MultiL-KRIM, a novel method for imputing missing values in time-varying edge flows on graphs. The approach combines multilinear kernel regression with manifold learning and incorporates graph topology through Hodge Laplacians to enforce physical consistency. MultiL-KRIM models data as points on a smooth manifold embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and uses local linear approximations for collaborative filtering. The method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining computational efficiency through dimensionality reduction via multilinear factorization.

## Method Summary
MultiL-KRIM addresses edge flow imputation by modeling the data as points on a smooth manifold in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, incorporating graph topology through Hodge Laplacians. The method selects landmark points via greedy max-min-distance strategy, constructs kernel matrices, and performs multilinear factorization with sparsity constraints. It solves the resulting inverse problem using parallel successive-convex-approximation optimization, incorporating divergence-free and curl-free priors for physical consistency. The approach requires no training data and enables efficient computation through dimensionality reduction.

## Key Results
- MultiL-KRIM achieves lower mean absolute error (MAE) than FlowSSL and S-VAR on both Cherry Hills water network and Sioux Falls transportation network datasets
- The method uses 21.3% of the parameters of S-VAR for the Cherry Hills dataset while maintaining superior accuracy
- Performance improvements are consistent across different sampling ratios (10-50% of available data)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Imputation accuracy improves by leveraging graph topology through Hodge Laplacians. The method uses divergence-free and curl-free priors on edge flows, encoded by Hodge Laplacians L1,l and L1,u, to regularize the imputation problem. This enforces physical consistency (inbound ≈ outbound at nodes, and cyclic flows along triangles ≈ zero) without relying on smoothness assumptions that fail for edge flows. Core assumption: Edge flows satisfy approximately divergence-free and curl-free conditions. Break condition: If edge flows violate divergence/curl-free assumptions (e.g., sources/sinks or strongly non-conservative flows), regularization with Hodge Laplacians will degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
Nonlinear modeling via RKHS and manifold learning captures complex feature dependencies better than linear models. Feature vectors φ(lk) live in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling functional approximation of missing flows via kernel-based representer theorem. Manifold assumption places data on a smooth manifold, and tangent-space approximation via sparse affine combinations (φ(ˇµt) ≈ Φ(L)vₜ) adds locality and collaborative filtering. Core assumption: Data lie near a smooth manifold in RKHS, and local linear patches approximate tangent spaces effectively. Break condition: If data manifold is highly nonlinear or not smooth, tangent-space approximation fails and imputation accuracy drops.

### Mechanism 3
Dimensionality reduction via multilinear factorization improves computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. MultiL-KRIM replaces a dense U matrix with multilinear factorization U = U₁U₂…U_Q and extends to X ≈ U₁U₂KV₁V₂, reducing parameters from O(N₁Nl) to O((N₁+Nl)d + (Nl+T)r). This enables handling large networks/time series efficiently. Core assumption: Low-rank structure exists in the data, allowing compact multilinear representation. Break condition: If data lacks low-rank structure, multilinear factorization introduces approximation error that hurts accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Simplicial complexes and Hodge Laplacians
  - Why needed here: They generalize graph Laplacians to model relationships between edges (via nodes) and triangles (via edges), enabling physical priors for edge flows (divergence-free, curl-free)
  - Quick check question: What does L1,l encode and why is it relevant for edge flow imputation?

- Concept: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and kernel methods
  - Why needed here: RKHS provides a framework for nonlinear function approximation of missing entries via kernel representer theorem, enabling modeling of complex dependencies
  - Quick check question: How does the reproducing property φ(l) := κ(l, ·) enable efficient computation of ⟨fi | φ(ˇµt)⟩H?

- Concept: Manifold learning and tangent space approximation
  - Why needed here: Assumes data lie on a smooth manifold; local linear patches approximate tangent spaces to enable collaborative filtering and locality in imputation
  - Quick check question: Why does enforcing 1ᵀNlvt = 1 (affine constraint) matter for collaborative filtering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Navigator data (selected snapshots) → Landmark points (via greedy max-min) → Kernel matrix K (Φ(L)⊺Φ(L)) → Multilinear factorization U₁U₂KV₁V₂ → Regularization with Hodge Laplacians L1,l, L1,u → Convex sub-problems (8a)-(8e) solved in parallel → Final imputed matrix X
- Critical path: Landmark selection → Kernel matrix construction → Multilinear factorization fitting → Regularization + parallel convex optimization → Output imputed X
- Design tradeoffs: Multilinear factorization vs. dense U (speed vs. expressivity); kernel choice (accuracy vs. kernel matrix size); regularization λ hyperparameters (bias vs. variance); sparsity vₜ (locality vs. approximation power)
- Failure signatures: High MAE vs. baselines; poor convergence in Algorithm 1; checkerboard patterns in heatmap visualizations of V matrices; unstable hyperparameter tuning (λs)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify Hodge Laplacian incorporation: Run MultiL-KRIM on a small network with and without Hodge Laplacian regularization; compare divergence/curl flow residuals
  2. Test multilinear factorization scalability: Vary d, r; measure runtime and imputation accuracy; confirm O((N₁+Nl)d + (Nl+T)r) scaling
  3. Validate kernel manifold learning: Replace RKHS kernel with linear kernel; compare MAE to confirm nonlinear modeling advantage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of MultiL-KRIM scale with increasing graph size and complexity? The paper demonstrates MultiL-KRIM's performance on two real-world networks (Cherry Hills and Sioux Falls) but does not explore scaling to larger or more complex graphs. Experimental results on graphs of varying sizes and complexities, along with computational complexity analysis as a function of graph parameters, would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of the choice of landmark points and feature maps on the imputation accuracy of MultiL-KRIM? The paper mentions that landmark points are selected using a greedy max-min-distance strategy and that feature maps are used to facilitate nonlinear approximation, but does not provide a detailed analysis of their impact on performance. Comparative studies using different landmark selection strategies and feature maps, along with sensitivity analysis of their impact on imputation accuracy, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does MultiL-KRIM handle temporal dependencies and non-stationarity in edge flows? The paper models edge flows as time-varying but does not explicitly address temporal dependencies or non-stationarity in the data. Analysis of MultiL-KRIM's performance on time series with varying degrees of temporal dependencies and non-stationarity, along with modifications to the method to explicitly model temporal dynamics, would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on the assumption that edge flows satisfy divergence-free and curl-free conditions, which may not hold for all network types
- Limited comparison to only two specific network datasets (Cherry Hills and Sioux Falls) raises uncertainty about generalizability to other graph structures
- Exact kernel function specification and optimal hyperparameter ranges were not fully detailed in the paper

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mathematical framework of Hodge Laplacians for edge flow regularization and the multilinear factorization approach for dimensionality reduction

**Medium confidence**: The empirical improvements shown on the two test networks, given the specific dataset characteristics

**Low confidence**: The method's performance on networks with strong non-conservative flows or highly nonlinear manifolds that violate the smoothness assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Test MultiL-KRIM on synthetic networks with controlled violations of divergence/curl-free conditions to quantify performance degradation
2. Benchmark against additional state-of-the-art methods (e.g., graph neural networks, matrix/tensor completion methods) on the same datasets
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the impact of landmark point selection strategy and kernel bandwidth on imputation accuracy
