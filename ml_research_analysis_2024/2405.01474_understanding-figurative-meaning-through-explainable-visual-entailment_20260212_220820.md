# Understanding Figurative Meaning through Explainable Visual Entailment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.01474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01474
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, especially when figurative content is in images rather than text.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces V-FLUTE, a dataset for evaluating how well vision-language models (VLMs) understand figurative meaning in images and captions. It frames figurative language understanding as an explainable visual entailment task, requiring models to judge whether an image entails or contradicts a caption and justify the decision with a textual explanation. The dataset covers five figurative phenomena—metaphor, simile, idiom, sarcasm, and humor—across 6,027 instances built using a human-AI collaboration approach with expert verification.

Automatic evaluation shows that VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, especially when figurative content is in images rather than text. Human evaluation reveals that even top models like GPT-4 often produce inadequate explanations, with common errors including hallucination, incomplete reasoning, and unsound logic. Humans significantly outperform VLMs overall, achieving nearly 90% F1 score compared to ~77% for the best fine-tuned model. Fine-tuning on a literal visual entailment dataset (e-ViL) yields minimal improvement, confirming the need for specialized figurative training data.

## Method Summary
The authors construct V-FLUTE through human-AI collaboration, starting with seed examples of figurative language and generating new instances using vision-language models. Expert annotators with bachelor's degrees in relevant fields verify all instances. The dataset contains 6,027 {image, caption, label, explanation} tuples covering five figurative phenomena. Models are evaluated using F1 score for label prediction and ExplanationScore (BERTScore + BLEURT) for explanation quality. Experiments include zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches across multiple VLMs including LLaVA variants, GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini.

## Key Results
- VLMs achieve only ~77% F1 score compared to nearly 90% for humans on figurative visual entailment
- Fine-tuning on literal visual entailment data (e-ViL) barely improves performance over random baseline
- Models perform significantly worse when figurative meaning appears in images rather than in text
- Common error types include hallucination, incomplete reasoning, and unsound logic in explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning on literal visual entailment data (e-ViL) does not transfer to figurative visual entailment tasks.
- Mechanism: Models trained on literal tasks fail to generalize because they rely on superficial correlations rather than deep understanding of implicit meaning.
- Core assumption: The figurative meaning in images requires reasoning about symbolic or metaphorical content that is not present in literal datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through automatic evaluation, we find that VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, particularly when it is present in images."
  - [section 4.3] "Fine-tuning only on e-ViL barely improves over a random baseline (54.34 F1@0) and underperforms compared with the models fine-tuned on V-FLUTE (72.78 F1@0). Moreover, the explanations are of poor quality (0.55 F1@60)."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct corpus evidence; inferred from experimental results.
- Break condition: If the figurative dataset contains sufficient literal examples or if the model learns transferable reasoning patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models perform worse when figurative meaning is present in images rather than in text.
- Mechanism: Visual reasoning about abstract concepts (e.g., metaphors in imagery) is harder than interpreting figurative text because it requires mapping visual elements to non-literal meanings.
- Core assumption: Visual metaphors and symbolic imagery require higher-order reasoning than textual metaphors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "particularly when it is present in images."
  - [section 4.3] "We plot the relative percentage decrease between F1@0 and F1@60 for LLaVA-eViL-VF, LLaVA-34B-SG, and GPT-4-5shot... The percentage drop is substantially higher for all models for the HAIVMet subset rather than the IRFL dataset, which contains metaphors in the image rather than in the text."
  - [corpus] Weak. No corpus evidence; inferred from experimental results.
- Break condition: If models are explicitly trained on visual metaphors or if the figurative content is explicitly labeled.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning on V-FLUTE improves performance over off-the-shelf models, especially when visual information is included.
- Mechanism: Specialized training on multimodal figurative data enables models to learn the implicit mappings between visual and textual figurative content.
- Core assumption: The V-FLUTE dataset captures sufficient diversity of figurative phenomena to enable generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Fine-tuning on a literal visual entailment dataset (e-ViL) yields minimal improvement, confirming the need for specialized figurative training data."
  - [section 4.3] "The strongest model fine-tuned on V-FLUTE (LLaVA-7B-eViL+VF) outperforms the best off-the-shelf model (GPT-4-5shot) in terms of the F1@0 score (p < 0.034)."
  - [section 4.3] "We utilize a hypothesis-only baseline... Fine-tuning on the full V-FLUTE dataset shows an improvement of over 8 points in F1@0 (better with p < 0.002)."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct corpus evidence; inferred from experimental results.
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning dataset is too small or lacks diversity in figurative phenomena.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Visual entailment task definition and setup
  - Why needed here: Understanding the task structure is essential for interpreting the experiments and results.
  - Quick check question: What are the two possible labels in the visual entailment task, and what do they mean?

- Concept: Figurative language phenomena (metaphor, simile, idiom, sarcasm, humor)
  - Why needed here: The dataset covers these five phenomena, so understanding their characteristics is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: Which of the five phenomena is most likely to be present in both images and captions?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics (F1 score, explanation score)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these metrics to assess model performance, so understanding their calculation and interpretation is important.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between F1@0 and F1@60, and why are both reported?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: V-FLUTE dataset construction -> Model fine-tuning -> Evaluation -> Analysis
- Critical path: 1) Construct V-FLUTE dataset with expert verification 2) Fine-tune LLaVA models on V-FLUTE and/or e-ViL 3) Evaluate models using F1@0, F1@53, F1@60 4) Conduct human evaluation of explanations 5) Analyze error types and model performance by phenomenon
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using GPT-4 for explanation generation vs. human-written explanations (cost vs. quality)
  - Fine-tuning on e-ViL vs. V-FLUTE (generalizability vs. task-specific performance)
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning (speed vs. accuracy)
  - Including visual information vs. hypothesis-only baseline (completeness vs. simplicity)
- Failure signatures:
  - Low F1@0 but high F1@60: Models can predict labels but fail to generate adequate explanations
  - High F1@0 but low F1@60: Models rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine understanding
  - Poor performance on image-based figurative phenomena: Models struggle with visual reasoning about abstract concepts
  - High hallucination rate in human evaluation: Models generate explanations not grounded in the image
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune LLaVA-7B on V-FLUTE and evaluate using F1@0, F1@53, F1@60
  2. Compare zero-shot performance of GPT-4 vs. fine-tuned LLaVA on image-based metaphors
  3. Conduct human evaluation of explanations from top-performing models to identify error types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can fine-tuning on a larger, more diverse literal visual entailment dataset improve VLM performance on figurative visual entailment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that fine-tuning on the relatively small e-ViL dataset (275,815 training instances) yields minimal improvement on V-FLUTE, suggesting that the size and diversity of the training data may be insufficient.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores fine-tuning on e-ViL and V-FLUTE. It does not investigate the impact of fine-tuning on larger or more diverse literal visual entailment datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where VLMs are fine-tuned on larger, more diverse literal visual entailment datasets (e.g., those containing a wider range of visual phenomena and contexts) and evaluating their performance on V-FLUTE would provide insights into whether data size and diversity are limiting factors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of VLMs on V-FLUTE compare to their performance on multimodal tasks involving literal meaning in real-world images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that most work on VLMs has focused on understanding literal meaning in images and captions, but does not provide a direct comparison of VLM performance on V-FLUTE versus tasks involving literal meaning in real-world images.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces V-FLUTE as a benchmark for assessing VLM understanding of figurative meaning, but does not benchmark VLM performance on tasks involving literal meaning in real-world images for comparison.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where VLMs are evaluated on both V-FLUTE and tasks involving literal meaning in real-world images (e.g., image captioning, visual question answering) and comparing their performance would provide insights into the relative difficulty of understanding figurative versus literal meaning in multimodal contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can incorporating knowledge about figurative language into the VLM architecture or training process improve performance on V-FLUTE?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, suggesting that their current architectures and training processes may not be well-suited for understanding figurative language.
- Why unresolved: The paper explores fine-tuning VLMs on V-FLUTE but does not investigate whether incorporating knowledge about figurative language into the VLM architecture or training process (e.g., through specialized modules or loss functions) can improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where VLMs are trained or fine-tuned with architectural modifications or training objectives that incorporate knowledge about figurative language (e.g., metaphor detection, idiom understanding) and evaluating their performance on V-FLUTE would provide insights into the effectiveness of such approaches.

## Limitations

- Dataset Construction: Exact criteria for expert selection and verification process remain unclear
- Generalizability: Dataset focuses on five specific figurative phenomena and may not capture full diversity of figurative language
- Model Comparison: Evaluation conditions are not consistently reported across all experiments

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- VLMs struggle with figurative visual entailment, particularly when figurative content appears in images rather than text
- Fine-tuning on literal visual entailment data (e-ViL) provides minimal transfer to figurative tasks
- Humans significantly outperform VLMs on both label prediction and explanation generation tasks

**Medium Confidence**:
- The specialized training on V-FLUTE improves performance over off-the-shelf models when visual information is included
- Explanation quality (F1@60) drops substantially more than label accuracy (F1@0) when moving from text-based to image-based figurative phenomena
- Common error patterns include hallucination, incomplete reasoning, and unsound logic in model-generated explanations

**Low Confidence**:
- The exact magnitude of performance improvement from fine-tuning vs. few-shot prompting across all model variants
- The specific impact of different figurative phenomena on model performance without further ablation studies
- The generalizability of results to other types of figurative language not covered in the V-FLUTE dataset

## Next Checks

1. **Replication of Human Evaluation**: Conduct independent human evaluation of model-generated explanations using the same criteria (F1@60 threshold of 0.6) to verify the reported performance gaps between VLMs and human performance.

2. **Cross-Dataset Transfer**: Test model performance on V-FLUTE after fine-tuning on other figurative language datasets or multimodal datasets to assess whether the improvement is specific to V-FLUTE training or generalizes to other figurative content.

3. **Error Analysis Validation**: Perform detailed error analysis on a subset of model failures to verify the reported error types (hallucination, incomplete reasoning, unsound logic) and identify whether specific error patterns correlate with particular figurative phenomena or model architectures.
