# Probabilistic Scoring Lists for Interpretable Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21535
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21535
- Reference count: 6
- The paper proposes PSL, which produces probability distributions rather than deterministic decisions, making it suitable for safety-critical domains like healthcare.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Probabilistic Scoring Lists (PSL), an extension of traditional scoring systems that produces probability distributions rather than deterministic decisions. PSL evaluates features sequentially, stopping when confidence is sufficient, making it particularly valuable for safety-critical domains like healthcare. The method combines probabilistic scoring with decision list structure and includes novel features like uncertainty quantification through confidence intervals and applicability to ranking tasks. Experiments on coronary heart disease and other medical datasets show that PSL performs comparably to logistic regression in terms of Brier score and AUC metrics, with particular value in risk-averse decision-making scenarios where confidence intervals help avoid false negatives.

## Method Summary
PSL is a learning method that constructs scoring systems with probabilistic outputs, where each feature is evaluated sequentially and the process stops when sufficient confidence is reached. The method uses greedy learning with expected entropy minimization, probability calibration through isotonic regression or beta calibration, and epistemic uncertainty quantification via Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. The algorithm handles both preprocessing and in-search feature binarization, with monotonicity constraints ensuring consistency between scores and probabilities. The approach is evaluated on three medical datasets (CHD, BCC, ILP) using Brier score for calibration quality, AUC for ranking performance, and expected loss with risk-averse decision-making using confidence intervals.

## Key Results
- PSL achieves Brier scores comparable to logistic regression on medical datasets, with particular strength in risk-averse scenarios
- The method demonstrates effective sequential feature evaluation, stopping early when confidence intervals are sufficiently narrow
- PSL shows tendency to overfit with limited training data, particularly in smaller datasets like Breast Cancer Coimbra

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PSL improves interpretability by generating probabilistic outputs instead of deterministic binary decisions.
- Mechanism: Instead of producing a hard class label, PSL returns a probability distribution over outcomes at each decision stage, reflecting uncertainty in the model's prediction.
- Core assumption: Probabilistic outputs are more informative for decision makers than binary outputs, especially in safety-critical contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Instead of making a deterministic decision, a PSL represents uncertainty in the form of probability distributions, or, more generally, probability intervals."
  - [section 3] "A probabilistic scoring system (PSS) over candidate features F and score set S ⊂ Z is a triple h = ⟨F, S, q⟩... q(T) = p(y = 1 | T) is the (estimated) probability for the positive class given that the total score is T."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus shows PSL is part of a broader family of interpretable ML methods, but no direct evidence about probabilistic calibration.
- Break condition: If the probabilistic estimates are poorly calibrated, the interpretability benefit may be undermined.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PSL enhances cost-efficiency by stopping evaluation once sufficient confidence is reached.
- Mechanism: PSL evaluates features sequentially and halts the process when the confidence interval around the probability estimate is narrow enough to make a decision, avoiding unnecessary computation.
- Core assumption: In practice, not all features need to be evaluated to reach a confident decision, reducing computational and data collection costs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, in the spirit of decision lists, a PSL evaluates features one by one and stops as soon as a decision can be made with enough confidence."
  - [section 3] "Each time a new feature is added, the total score T is updated, and the probability q(T) of the positive class is determined. Depending on the latter, the process is then continued or stopped: If the probability is sufficiently high or sufficiently low, the process is stopped..."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence about feature acquisition costs or stopping criteria.
- Break condition: If confidence intervals are too wide or non-monotonic, stopping criteria may fail or lead to poor decisions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PSL's monotonicity constraint ensures consistency between score and probability.
- Mechanism: The monotonicity condition (2) guarantees that as the total score increases, the estimated probability of the positive class never decreases, aligning with user intuition.
- Core assumption: Monotonic relationships between score and probability are essential for model trust and interpretability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Note that an increase in the total score should only increase but not decrease the probability of the positive decision, so that probabilistic scoring systems should satisfy the following monotonicity constraint: ∀ T, T ′ ∈ Σ : ( T < T ′) ⇒ q(T) ≤ q(T ′)."
  - [section 4] "As for the estimation of the probabilities q(k, T), the most obvious idea would be a standard frequentist approach... However, as these estimates are obtained independently for each score T, they may violate the monotonicity condition (2)."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence about monotonicity violations or user trust.
- Break condition: If monotonicity is violated due to estimation error, model interpretability and trust may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probability calibration
  - Why needed here: PSL's effectiveness depends on accurate probability estimates; calibration methods like isotonic regression or beta calibration ensure these estimates reflect true likelihoods.
  - Quick check question: What happens to PSL's predictions if calibration is skipped and raw frequencies are used instead?
- Concept: Decision list structure
  - Why needed here: PSL extends decision lists by incorporating probabilistic scoring; understanding the sequential, stopping nature of decision lists is key to grasping PSL's efficiency.
  - Quick check question: How does PSL's sequential evaluation differ from evaluating all features at once?
- Concept: Epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty
  - Why needed here: PSL quantifies epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge) via confidence intervals, which is critical for risk-aware decision making.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the context of PSL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature binarization -> Greedy PSL construction -> Probability calibration -> Epistemic uncertainty quantification -> Decision stopping logic
- Critical path: Binarize features -> Greedy feature/score selection -> Calibrate probabilities -> Quantify uncertainty -> Apply stopping rule
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Preprocessing binarization is simpler but ignores feature interactions; in-search binarization is more complex but adapts thresholds based on selected features.
  - Beta calibration offers more flexibility than isotonic regression but may be more prone to overfitting with limited data.
  - Wider confidence intervals increase robustness but may delay or prevent decisions.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor calibration → Overconfident or underconfident probability estimates.
  - Wide confidence intervals → PSL never stops evaluating, reducing efficiency.
  - Overfitting → Poor generalization, especially with small datasets or too many features.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train PSL on a small binary dataset (e.g., UCI breast cancer) and compare Brier scores with logistic regression; observe overfitting.
  2. Implement both preprocessing and in-search binarization on a dataset with continuous features; compare expected entropy.
  3. Add Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to PSL; evaluate how upper bounds affect risk-averse decision making.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can PSLs be regularized to prevent overfitting when dealing with small training datasets?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that PSLs tend to overfit with limited training data, particularly in the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset, and suggests that incorporating regularization in the training procedure is an important next step.
  - Why unresolved: The paper identifies overfitting as a problem but does not provide a concrete solution or experimental results on regularization methods for PSLs.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing PSLs with different regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization, dropout) on small datasets, showing improved performance metrics such as Brier score and AUC.

- Question: How effective are PSLs in handling missing features, and what default strategies work best?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests developing a more sensitive version of the PSL that produces models robust to missing features and mentions considering default scores for missing features.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of missing features on PSL performance or test different strategies for handling them.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies on PSLs with various default strategies (e.g., mean imputation, median imputation, model-based imputation) and their impact on performance metrics across datasets with artificially introduced missing values.

- Question: Can PSLs be extended to polychotomous classification tasks, and how would this affect their interpretability and performance?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that extending PSLs to decision spaces of higher cardinality (polychotomous classification) is practically relevant but does not explore this extension.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on binary classification and does not provide any analysis or experiments on polychotomous classification with PSLs.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of PSLs for polychotomous classification tasks, comparing performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and interpretability with other multi-class classification methods.

## Limitations

- PSL tends to overfit with limited training data, particularly in smaller datasets like Breast Cancer Coimbra, with no concrete regularization solutions provided
- The method's reliance on feature binarization may lead to information loss, especially for continuous features, with weak corpus evidence on discretization impact
- Evaluation is limited to three relatively small medical datasets, raising questions about generalizability to non-medical domains and larger feature spaces

## Confidence

- Probabilistic output interpretability: High confidence - clear mathematical formulation and empirical validation
- Sequential evaluation efficiency: High confidence - demonstrated through confidence interval stopping criteria
- Generalizability beyond medical domains: Medium confidence - limited to three medical datasets
- Handling of continuous features through binarization: Low confidence - weak corpus evidence and limited analysis of information loss

## Next Checks

1. Test PSL on non-medical domains (e.g., financial fraud detection or fault diagnosis) to assess generalizability beyond healthcare applications
2. Compare PSL's performance against modern interpretable models like XGBoost with feature importance analysis and SHAP values to establish its relative advantages
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the monotonicity constraint and confidence interval quantification to isolate their contributions to PSL's performance
