# Capturing Style in Author and Document Representation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13358

- Reference count: 40
- VADES achieves up to 95.6% accuracy on IMDb62 authorship attribution

## Executive Summary
VADES introduces a variational information bottleneck framework for learning author and document representations that explicitly capture writing style. By combining stylistic features with text encoding and optimizing for both authorship attribution and style prediction, VADES outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while significantly improving stylistic feature prediction. The model achieves interpretable embeddings where each dimension corresponds to specific stylistic features, enabling visualization of author clusters and detection of stylistic outliers.

## Method Summary
VADES uses a variational information bottleneck (VIB) framework to learn probabilistic representations for both authors and documents. The model fine-tunes a pre-trained text encoder (Universal Sentence Encoder) and adds 300 stylistic features as input. It optimizes a dual objective: contrastive loss for authorship attribution and MSE loss for stylistic feature prediction. The learned embeddings are interpretable, with each dimension corresponding to a specific stylistic feature, enabling both authorship attribution and style analysis.

## Key Results
- Achieves 95.6% accuracy on IMDb62 authorship attribution
- Reduces style prediction error by up to 50% compared to existing methods
- Improves stylistic feature prediction while maintaining high authorship attribution accuracy
- Learns interpretable embeddings with dimensions corresponding to specific stylistic features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
VADES captures writing style by optimizing for both authorship attribution and stylistic feature prediction simultaneously. The VIB framework maximizes mutual information between representations and stylistic features while minimizing semantic information. This dual objective forces embeddings to encode style rather than topic content. The predefined stylistic features serve as sufficient proxies for writing style that can be predicted from author representations.

### Mechanism 2
The variational information bottleneck framework enables learning interpretable author and document representations by modeling them as probability distributions. This allows capturing uncertainty and variability in writing style across different documents and authors. The learned variance parameters correlate with actual stylistic variation, providing interpretability benefits through uncertainty modeling.

### Mechanism 3
Using a pre-trained text encoder with fine-tuning allows VADES to leverage complex language understanding while focusing on stylistic features. The pre-trained encoder (USE) already captures syntactic and grammatical notions that include stylistic information, even if not explicitly trained for it. Fine-tuning shifts focus from semantic to stylistic content.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)**
  - Why needed here: VIB provides principled way to learn compressed representations that retain only information relevant to stylistic features while discarding semantic content
  - Quick check question: How does the β parameter in VIB control the trade-off between preserving stylistic information and compressing semantic information?

- **Concept: Contrastive learning**
  - Why needed here: Soft contrastive loss helps separate author-document pairs from negative samples, improving representation quality
  - Quick check question: Why does using a soft contrastive loss (with sigmoid) rather than a hard loss provide more flexibility in learning stylistic representations?

- **Concept: Stylistic feature extraction**
  - Why needed here: Predefined stylistic features serve as ground truth for training model to capture writing style rather than content
  - Quick check question: What are limitations of using predefined linguistic features as proxies for abstract concept of "writing style"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text encoder (USE) → MLP for mean/variance (f, g) → VIB framework with dual objectives → Stylistic feature predictor → Author embeddings (mean/variance parameters) → Cosine similarity for authorship attribution → Stylistic feature vectors → L2 distance constraint for interpretability

- **Critical path**: 1. Text encoding → 2. Mean/variance prediction → 3. Sampling via reparameterization → 4. Dual loss computation → 5. Backpropagation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Pre-trained encoder offers faster convergence but may require effort to shift focus to style; probabilistic representations allow uncertainty modeling but increase computational complexity; more stylistic features provide better style capture but increase dimensionality

- **Failure signatures**: High style prediction MSE with low authorship accuracy indicates model captures authorship but not style; low style prediction MSE with poor authorship accuracy indicates model captures style but can't distinguish authors; both metrics poor indicates model fails to learn meaningful representations

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline comparison: VADES with α=0 vs USE baseline on IMDb62 authorship attribution; 2. Ablation study: VADES vs VADES no-VIB on style prediction task; 3. Parameter sensitivity: Vary α from 0 to 1 and plot accuracy vs style MSE tradeoff curve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does VADES's performance compare when using alternative text encoders like LLaMA instead of USE? The paper mentions LLaMA as future direction without implementation or results.

- **Open Question 2**: What is the optimal balance between authorship attribution loss and stylistic feature prediction loss (α parameter) across different corpus types? The paper notes α needs careful tuning but doesn't systematically explore variation across writing styles.

- **Open Question 3**: Can VADES effectively capture writing style in languages other than English? The model claims to be language-agnostic but only tests on English corpora.

## Limitations

- Reliance on predefined stylistic features as proxies for writing style may not capture all relevant aspects
- Evaluation focuses on quantitative metrics rather than qualitative assessment of what stylistic aspects are captured
- Interpretability claims lack rigorous validation that individual dimensions map to interpretable stylistic properties

## Confidence

*High Confidence*:
- VADES achieves state-of-the-art authorship attribution accuracy on established benchmarks
- VIB framework provides benefits over fixed representations
- Style prediction performance improves with stylistic features as input

*Medium Confidence*:
- Learned embeddings are truly "interpretable" with individual dimensions corresponding to specific stylistic features
- Model captures "writing style" as humans would define it
- Combination of pre-trained encoder + VIB + stylistic features is optimal

*Low Confidence*:
- Model would generalize to domains not represented in training data
- Specific choice of 300 stylistic features captures all relevant aspects of writing style
- Interpretability benefits would persist with different text encoders or feature sets

## Next Checks

1. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Conduct ablation study removing subsets of stylistic features to determine which categories contribute most to performance and validate optimal feature combination.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate VADES on dataset from substantially different domain (scientific papers, news articles, social media) to assess whether learned style representations transfer beyond movie review domain.

3. **Human Evaluation of Interpretability**: Conduct human study where participants identify which stylistic properties correspond to individual embedding dimensions or verify authors with similar styles cluster together according to human judgment.
