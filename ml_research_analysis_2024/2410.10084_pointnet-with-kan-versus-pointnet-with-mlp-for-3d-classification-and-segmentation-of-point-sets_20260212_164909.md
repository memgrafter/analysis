# PointNet with KAN versus PointNet with MLP for 3D Classification and Segmentation of Point Sets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10084
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10084
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: PointNet-KAN achieves competitive results on ModelNet40 (90.5% accuracy) and ShapeNet part segmentation (83.3% mean IoU) using fewer parameters than baseline PointNet

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PointNet-KAN, which integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into PointNet for 3D point cloud processing. By replacing traditional MLPs with KANs that learn parameterized activation functions using Jacobi polynomials, the authors demonstrate competitive performance on classification and segmentation tasks while using a shallower, more parameter-efficient architecture. The approach maintains PointNet's core principles of permutation invariance through shared KAN layers and symmetric max-pooling operations. A hybrid PointNet-KAN-MLP model combining KAN encoders with MLP decoders further improves performance, suggesting complementary strengths between these architectures.

## Method Summary
The paper systematically replaces MLPs in PointNet with KAN layers using Jacobi polynomials of varying degrees and types (Legendre, Chebyshev, Gegenbauer). The core architecture maintains PointNet's permutation invariance through shared KAN layers and symmetric max-pooling. For classification on ModelNet40, PointNet-KAN uses two shared KAN layers followed by max-pooling and additional KAN layers for global feature processing. For part segmentation on ShapeNet, the architecture extends to include feature propagation and shared KAN layers for segmentation predictions. The hybrid PointNet-KAN-MLP variant replaces only the decoder layers with MLPs while keeping KAN encoders. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate decay, and input point clouds are normalized to the unit sphere.

## Key Results
- PointNet-KAN achieves 90.5% overall accuracy on ModelNet40 classification versus 89.2% for baseline PointNet
- PointNet-KAN achieves 83.3% mean IoU on ShapeNet part segmentation versus 83.7% for baseline PointNet
- The architecture uses only 0.6M parameters (vs ~0.8M for baseline) while maintaining competitive performance
- PointNet-KAN-MLP hybrid achieves 83.9% mean IoU, surpassing both pure KAN and pure MLP versions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KAN layers achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters by learning flexible activation functions rather than fixed ones.
- Mechanism: In traditional MLPs, weights and biases are trained with fixed activation functions, whereas in KANs, the activation functions themselves are trained as parameterized polynomials (Jacobi polynomials in this case), allowing for more expressive function approximation with fewer layers.
- Core assumption: The learnable activation functions in KANs can capture complex relationships with fewer sequential layers than MLPs, compensating for the reduced depth.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves."
  - [section] "It is worth noting that PointNet-KAN with n = 2 has only roughly 0.6M trainable parameters, making it lighter than PointNet (baseline) while still achieving an overall accuracy of 89.9"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence comparing parameter efficiency between KANs and MLPs
- Break condition: If the learnable activation functions fail to generalize beyond the training distribution or require excessive polynomial degrees to match MLP performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The combination of shared KAN layers and symmetric max-pooling preserves permutation invariance while extracting global features effectively.
- Mechanism: PointNet's core principle of permutation invariance is maintained by using shared KAN layers (same functional tensor applied to all points) and symmetric max-pooling operations to aggregate local features into global representations.
- Core assumption: The learned activation functions in shared KAN layers can effectively extract local features that are then appropriately aggregated by max-pooling to maintain invariance to point ordering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The use of the shared KAN layers and the symmetric max-pooling function ensure that PointNet-KAN is invariant to the order of the points in the point cloud."
  - [section] "the goal is to preserve and utilize the core principles upon which PointNet is built. First, we apply shared KANs, meaning that the same KANs are applied to all input points. Second, we utilize a symmetric function, such as the max function, to extract global features from the points."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence on permutation invariance properties of KAN-based architectures
- Break condition: If the shared KAN layers introduce unintended dependencies between points that violate permutation invariance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hybrid architectures combining KAN encoders with MLP decoders achieve better performance than either component alone.
- Mechanism: KAN layers are more effective at extracting global features (encoder role) due to their flexible activation functions, while MLPs are less prone to overfitting and more effective at mapping global features to predictions (decoder role).
- Core assumption: Different neural network components have complementary strengths - KANs for feature extraction and MLPs for classification/decoding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we propose PointNet-KAN-MLP, in which we simply replace the shared KAN decoder layers... with shared MLP layers... We observe a mean IoU of 83.9%, which surpasses the performance of both PointNet (83.3%) and PointNet-KAN (83.7%)"
  - [section] "KAN layers appear to perform better than MLP layers within the set abstraction modules for feature extraction. On the other hand, shared MLPs are less prone to overfitting and are more effective at mapping global features to classification scores"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence on hybrid KAN-MLP architecture performance
- Break condition: If the architectural complexity of hybrid models negates the parameter efficiency benefits or if the encoder-decoder split doesn't align with the problem structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Point cloud representation and permutation invariance
  - Why needed here: Understanding why PointNet's architecture uses shared layers and symmetric functions is crucial for grasping how KANs can replace MLPs while maintaining the same invariance properties
  - Quick check question: Why must point cloud processing architectures be invariant to the order of input points, and how does max-pooling achieve this?

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem
  - Why needed here: KANs are based on this theorem, which states that multivariate continuous functions can be represented as compositions of univariate functions and additions - understanding this helps explain why KANs work
  - Quick check question: What is the key insight from the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem that motivates the design of KANs?

- Concept: Jacobi polynomials and their special cases
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Jacobi polynomials to construct KAN layers, and understanding their properties helps explain the choice of polynomial degree and type
  - Quick check question: How do Legendre, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials relate to Jacobi polynomials, and why might different choices affect performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Shared KAN layer(s) -> Batch normalization -> Max-pooling -> Global feature processing -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Input normalization (scaling to [-1, 1] for Jacobi polynomials)
  2. Shared KAN layer application
  3. Batch normalization
  4. Max-pooling for global feature extraction
  5. Global feature processing
  6. Output layer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth vs. parameter efficiency: KANs can achieve similar performance with fewer layers but may require more computation per layer
  - Polynomial degree: Higher degrees increase expressiveness but also parameter count and overfitting risk
  - Shared vs. unshared layers: Shared layers maintain permutation invariance but may limit local feature specialization

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: High training accuracy but poor test performance, especially with higher polynomial degrees
  - Instability: Training loss oscillates or fails to converge due to the complexity of learning activation functions
  - Invariance violations: Performance varies with input point ordering, indicating broken permutation invariance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare PointNet-KAN with different Jacobi polynomial degrees (n=2, n=4) on ModelNet40 classification to understand the depth-parameter tradeoff
  2. Test PointNet-KAN with different polynomial types (Legendre, Chebyshev, Gegenbauer) to identify if any special cases perform better
  3. Implement the hybrid PointNet-KAN-MLP architecture and compare its performance to pure KAN and pure MLP versions on ShapeNet part segmentation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would KAN layers perform when integrated into more advanced point cloud architectures beyond PointNet and PointNet++?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their work focuses on PointNet to isolate KAN effects, and suggest "this raises the question of whether redesigning these networks using KANs instead of MLPs could improve their accuracy" regarding more advanced architectures like PointNet++, DGCNN, KPConv, etc.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests KAN integration in PointNet and PointNet++, not in other advanced architectures mentioned.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of KAN layers in architectures like DGCNN, KPConv, Point Transformer, and PointMLP, comparing performance against their MLP-based counterparts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between KAN and MLP layers in hybrid architectures for different point cloud tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that "KAN layers appear to perform better than MLP layers within the set abstraction modules for feature extraction" while "shared MLPs are less prone to overfitting and are more effective at mapping global features to classification scores," leading to their hybrid PointNet-KAN-MLP architecture.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a specific configuration (KAN encoders, MLP decoders) but doesn't systematically explore different ratios or placements of KAN vs MLP layers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies testing various combinations of KAN and MLP layers in different positions within the network architecture for classification and segmentation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What causes KAN layers to be more prone to overfitting in segmentation tasks compared to classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note "KAN layers have been shown to be more prone to overfitting in different applications" and observe this affects segmentation performance more than classification, though they don't explain the underlying cause.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the overfitting issue but doesn't investigate its root causes or why it affects segmentation more than classification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of KAN layer behavior during training, including activation function evolution, gradient dynamics, and feature space analysis to identify why overfitting occurs and differs between tasks.

## Limitations
- The computational complexity of KAN layers with high-degree polynomials remains unclear, particularly for real-time applications
- The hybrid PointNet-KAN-MLP architecture is mentioned in results but lacks detailed architectural specifications in the methods section
- The claim that KANs achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters is not fully substantiated with comprehensive ablation studies

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance on ModelNet40 and ShapeNet tasks with reduced parameter counts. The basic architecture of replacing MLPs with shared KAN layers while maintaining permutation invariance is sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority of hybrid KAN-MLP architectures over pure versions needs more rigorous validation. The robustness claims to point dropout require systematic testing across different dropout rates.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of KANs beyond the tested datasets and the scalability to more complex 3D tasks like semantic segmentation on large outdoor scenes remain unproven.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying polynomial degrees (n=2, 4, 6) on ModelNet40 to quantify the exact parameter-efficiency tradeoff and identify optimal configurations.
2. Implement the hybrid PointNet-KAN-MLP architecture with detailed architectural specifications and validate its performance advantage over pure KAN and pure MLP versions across multiple datasets.
3. Test PointNet-KAN's robustness to varying levels of point dropout (10%, 25%, 50%) on both classification and segmentation tasks to substantiate the claimed robustness advantage.
