- First effort to create a teaching KG specifically for KG courses

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a teaching Knowledge Graph (KG) to address the challenge of scattered and non-standardized educational resources in Knowledge Graph courses. The approach creates a resource-focused KG with interconnected semantic layers linking topics, courses, materials, and lecturers. It extends the EduCOR ontology and incorporates Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) for each lecturer. The system enables semantic similarity-based retrieval of educational materials and hierarchical topic organization with prerequisite relationships. The work is notable as the first effort to create a teaching KG specifically for KG courses, aiming to serve as a foundation for educational AI applications while ensuring quality through expert-verified content.

## Method Summary
The approach constructs a teaching KG by integrating educational resources through semantic layers that connect topics, courses, materials, and lecturers. The system extends the EduCOR ontology and creates Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) for each lecturer, enabling semantic similarity-based retrieval and hierarchical topic organization with prerequisite relationships. The methodology focuses on creating interconnected layers that link educational resources through semantic relationships, while maintaining quality through expert-verified content validation.

## Key Results
- Creates the first teaching KG specifically designed for Knowledge Graph courses
- Implements semantic similarity-based retrieval of educational materials
- Establishes hierarchical topic organization with prerequisite relationships
- Extends EduCOR ontology for educational KG applications
- Incorporates Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) for individual lecturers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by creating a resource-focused KG with interconnected semantic layers that link topics, courses, materials, and lecturers through structured relationships. By extending the EduCOR ontology and incorporating PKGs, the system can capture both institutional and individual teaching knowledge. Semantic similarity-based retrieval enables more nuanced and context-aware material discovery compared to traditional keyword search methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **EduCOR ontology extension**: Required to represent educational resources and relationships specific to KG teaching contexts. Quick check: Verify ontology covers all necessary educational entities (courses, materials, topics, prerequisites).
- **Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs)**: Needed to capture individual lecturer expertise and teaching preferences. Quick check: Ensure PKGs maintain privacy while enabling knowledge sharing.
- **Semantic similarity metrics**: Essential for retrieving relevant educational materials beyond keyword matching. Quick check: Test retrieval accuracy against expert-curated material sets.
- **Prerequisite relationship modeling**: Critical for maintaining proper learning progression in KG courses. Quick check: Validate prerequisite chains with course instructors.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Topic Layer -> Course Layer -> Material Layer -> Lecturer Layer -> Semantic Similarity Engine -> Prerequisite Checker

**Critical Path**: Topic selection → Material retrieval → Prerequisite validation → Knowledge graph update

**Design Tradeoffs**: Expert-verified content ensures quality but limits scalability; semantic similarity enables nuanced retrieval but requires computational resources; PKGs capture individual expertise but raise privacy considerations.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor semantic similarity results indicate ontology mismatches; missing prerequisite relationships suggest incomplete topic modeling; PKGs with limited connections indicate insufficient lecturer participation.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test semantic similarity retrieval with 10-15 known material sets; 2) Validate prerequisite relationships with 5-7 course syllabi; 3) Compare PKG connections against actual teaching experience.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scope limited to KG courses rather than broader educational applications
- Expert-verified content approach may not scale to larger resource sets
- No performance metrics provided for semantic similarity-based retrieval
- Limited generalizability to other educational domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in novelty claim for KG-specific teaching KGs
- Medium confidence in technical implementation of semantic layers and PKGs
- Low confidence in scalability claims due to lack of performance evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with KG course instructors to evaluate practical utility and accuracy of prerequisite relationship suggestions
2. Test system performance with larger, more diverse educational resource sets to assess scalability
3. Implement A/B testing comparing semantic similarity-based retrieval against traditional keyword search methods for educational material discovery
