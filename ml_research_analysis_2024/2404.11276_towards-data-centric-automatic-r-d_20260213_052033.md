# Towards Data-Centric Automatic R&D

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11276
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11276
- Authors: Haotian Chen, Xinjie Shen, Zeqi Ye, Wenjun Feng, Haoxue Wang, Xiao Yang, Xu Yang, Weiqing Liu, Jiang Bian
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces RD2Bench benchmark to evaluate LLMs on data-centric automatic R&D tasks involving information extraction and code implementation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RD2Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' capabilities in data-centric automatic research and development (D-CARD). The benchmark addresses the challenge of automating R&D processes by testing models' ability to extract implementable methods from raw information and execute them to obtain results. The authors test popular LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-35-turbo, and LLaMa models on tasks involving formula and model architecture implementation, finding that while GPT-4 shows promise for simple tasks, significant improvements are needed for handling complex methods and domain-specific knowledge.

## Method Summary
The RD2Bench benchmark evaluates LLMs on two main task types: formula implementation (27 financial formulas from reports) and model architecture implementation (6 open-source graph neural networks). Models are tested using Azure OpenAI API with 20 independent attempts per task, measuring running success rate, format success rate, and consistency metrics. The evaluation pipeline extracts methods from raw research materials, generates implementation code, and validates results against human-annotated ground truth.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 demonstrates capability to handle some simple D-CARD tasks without additional techniques
- Significant performance gaps exist between simple and complex method implementations
- Current LLMs struggle with domain-specific knowledge requirements and complex method understanding
- Running success rates and tensor shape consistency vary significantly across model types and task complexities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4's strong language understanding enables effective information extraction from raw research materials
- Mechanism: GPT-4 processes complex natural language descriptions in papers and reports, identifying implementable methods by comprehending semantic meaning of conditions and generating corresponding code
- Core assumption: Language understanding ability translates directly to method identification accuracy
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "strong language understanding ability to identify the implementable methods or ideas"; [section 3.3] "accurately and comprehensively extract the methods mentioned in the research materials"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4's programming capability allows implementation of identified methods into executable code
- Mechanism: GPT-4 translates extracted method descriptions into Python code, selecting appropriate data features and performing calculations according to method specifications
- Core assumption: Programming ability from pre-training enables code generation for mathematical formulas and model architectures
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "strong implementation ability to accurately implement the methods by programming"; [section 4.3] "GPT-4 possesses the ability to tackle some simple D-CARD cases"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4's synergistic effects between language understanding and programming create a foundation for automatic R&D
- Mechanism: The combination of extraction and implementation capabilities enables end-to-end R&D automation, where methods are identified and executed without human intervention
- Core assumption: Individual capabilities combine multiplicatively rather than additively for R&D tasks
- Evidence anchors: [section 1] "benchmark all the operations in data-centric automatic R&D (D-CARD) as a whole"; [section 4.3] "promising potency in tackling D-CARD" but "ample room for future work"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information extraction from unstructured text
  - Why needed here: Raw research materials contain methods in natural language that must be identified and extracted
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how to identify implementable methods from a research paper's methodology section?

- Concept: Code generation from specifications
  - Why needed here: Extracted methods must be translated into executable Python code for calculation
  - Quick check question: How would you convert a mathematical formula description into Python code using pandas?

- Concept: Data selection and preprocessing
  - Why needed here: Implementation requires selecting appropriate data features from available datasets
  - Quick check question: What factors determine which data features to use when implementing a financial formula?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw information → Method extraction → Data selection → Code generation → Result calculation → Output storage
- Critical path: Information extraction → Code generation → Execution → Result validation
- Design tradeoffs: Model capability vs. domain knowledge requirements; accuracy vs. execution speed; comprehensiveness vs. precision
- Failure signatures: Failed execution indicates code generation issues; wrong results indicate extraction or data selection problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple financial formula with clear data requirements
  2. Attempt a medium-complexity model architecture with PyTorch
  3. Extract and implement a method with ambiguous data feature descriptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can RD2Bench be extended to evaluate more open-source models and include additional R&D domains beyond data-centric scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that RD2Bench only evaluates representative base LLMs and includes most representative R&D domains and problems, focusing on data-driven scenarios
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation and states that more comprehensive evaluation will be included in future work, indicating that this is an open question for further research
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence of RD2Bench being extended to evaluate a broader range of open-source models and R&D domains, with results showing improved generalizability and performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: What techniques can be developed to improve LLMs' ability to query domain-specific knowledge for D-CARD tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that the ability to query domain-specific knowledge is a basic requirement of D-CARD methods, and that missing this knowledge impedes precise calculations
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights the importance of domain-specific knowledge, it does not provide specific techniques for improving LLMs' ability to acquire and utilize this knowledge
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and demonstration of techniques that significantly improve LLMs' performance in D-CARD tasks by enhancing their ability to query and apply domain-specific knowledge

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can RD2Bench be adapted to evaluate models' ability to generate new methods and formulas when none are explicitly mentioned in the research materials?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that in future iterations, they plan to explore and assess the model's ability to generate new names and formulas when none are explicitly mentioned
- Why unresolved: The current version of RD2Bench only evaluates models on methods that are explicitly mentioned by name, leaving the question of how to evaluate generative capabilities unanswered
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of new evaluation metrics and benchmarks within RD2Bench that specifically measure models' ability to generate novel, implementable methods and formulas from research materials

## Limitations

- The RD2Bench dataset composition and difficulty distribution are not fully specified
- Evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that may not capture research outcome quality
- Testing protocol uses fixed prompt templates without exploring prompt engineering variations
- Benchmark focuses on only two specific task types (formula and model architecture) which may not represent full R&D spectrum

## Confidence

- High Confidence: LLMs can handle simple D-CARD tasks but struggle with complex methods
- Medium Confidence: GPT-4's specific capabilities in information extraction and code generation are supported by task-specific results
- Low Confidence: RD2Bench comprehensively evaluates all aspects of D-CARD processes due to narrow task scope

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Composition Analysis**: Request and analyze the full RD2Bench dataset to understand the difficulty distribution and identify whether current LLM performance gaps stem from task complexity or specific domain knowledge requirements.

2. **Prompt Engineering Exploration**: Systematically test different prompt formulations and few-shot examples to determine whether current performance ceilings are due to model limitations or sub-optimal prompting strategies.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate the same LLMs on R&D tasks from different scientific domains (beyond financial formulas and graph neural networks) to assess whether performance patterns generalize or are domain-specific.
