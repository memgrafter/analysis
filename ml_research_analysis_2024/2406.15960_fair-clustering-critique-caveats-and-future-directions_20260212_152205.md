# Fair Clustering: Critique, Caveats, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.15960
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15960
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Critical examination of fair clustering, highlighting overlooked issues in utility, welfare, and downstream effects

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a critical examination of fair clustering, identifying key issues often overlooked in the literature. The authors highlight problems with utility and welfare considerations, noting that fair clustering algorithms can sometimes degrade overall welfare or cause inequitable welfare degradation across groups. They also discuss unintended downstream effects in machine learning settings, where fair clustering outputs may lead to false positives/negatives in outlier detection or compromise cluster homogeneity needed for simpler ML methods.

The paper points out weaknesses in experimental methods and datasets used in fair clustering research, emphasizing the need for concrete applications and representative real-world data. Additionally, it raises concerns about the numerous fairness constraints introduced and their interactions, as well as the lack of consideration for explainability, strategic manipulations, and unknown group memberships. The authors conclude by suggesting directions for more impactful research, including better utility modeling, long-term fairness considerations, and engaging stakeholders in developing fairness notions.

## Method Summary
The paper takes a theoretical and conceptual approach to critiquing fair clustering, rather than presenting a specific algorithmic contribution. It synthesizes and analyzes existing fair clustering literature, identifying key areas where current approaches may fall short. The authors propose a utility-based framework for evaluating fair clustering algorithms and discuss potential downstream effects in machine learning pipelines. They also call for more rigorous experimental methods and the development of concrete applications for fair clustering.

## Key Results
- Fair clustering algorithms can degrade overall welfare and cause inequitable welfare degradation across groups
- Fair clustering may have unintended downstream effects in machine learning settings, such as false positives/negatives in outlier detection
- Current experimental methods and datasets in fair clustering research have significant limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fair clustering can degrade overall welfare and group-specific welfare due to imposing fairness constraints that ignore utility considerations.
- Mechanism: The fair clustering algorithms prioritize proportional representation or other fairness constraints, leading to assignments that may increase individual distances to centers and/or reduce the quality of outcomes associated with centers. This directly reduces the utility function defined as dependent on both distance and outcome.
- Core assumption: Individuals' utilities are monotonically decreasing with distance to assigned center and dependent on the quality of the outcome associated with that center.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In some cases, we demonstrate examples where the application of a fair clustering algorithm can have significant negative impacts on social welfare."
  - [section]: "Therefore, in general the utility a point gains in a clustering ( S, ϕ) can be reasonably approximated by: uj(S, ϕ) = fj(dj, ϕ(j), L(ϕ, j)) where fj is a two-input function. L(ϕ, j) is the outcome associated with the center (cluster)."
- Break condition: If the utility function does not depend on distance or outcome, or if the fairness constraint somehow improves both simultaneously.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fair clustering can lead to inequitable welfare degradation across groups, where one group bears a disproportionate burden of the cost of fairness.
- Mechanism: Different optimal fair clustering solutions can exist that satisfy the same fairness constraints but result in significantly different distance assignments for different groups. This leads to situations where one group's welfare is degraded much more than another's.
- Core assumption: Multiple optimal solutions exist for the same fairness-constrained clustering problem, and these solutions can have different welfare impacts on different groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In some cases, we demonstrate examples where the application of a fair clustering algorithm can have significant negative impacts on social welfare."
  - [section]: "However, as can be seen from the output most blue and red points have to travel a much larger distance in the new CM clustering. As the distance becomes sufficiently large, one can conclude that the welfare of the blue group Ublue as well as that of the red group Ured has indeed been degraded because of the application of the CM constraint and accordingly the entire welfare U has been degraded."
- Break condition: If all optimal fair solutions have identical welfare impacts across groups, or if the fairness constraint inherently equalizes welfare degradation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fair clustering can cause unintended downstream effects in machine learning pipelines, such as false positives/negatives in outlier detection or compromising cluster homogeneity needed for simpler ML methods.
- Mechanism: Fair clustering algorithms may assign points to centers that are further away to satisfy fairness constraints, which violates the traditional ML clustering assumption that points in the same cluster should be similar. This affects post-processing methods that rely on cluster homogeneity.
- Core assumption: Traditional ML methods assume that points within a cluster are similar and that distance to assigned center is a reliable indicator for outlier detection or that cluster homogeneity enables simpler classification methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "They also discuss unintended downstream effects in machine learning settings, where fair clustering outputs may lead to false positives/negatives in outlier detection or compromise cluster homogeneity needed for simpler ML methods."
  - [section]: "Therefore, if the data analyst chooses to apply such an outlier detection method over the output of a fair clustering using the distance of a point to its assigned center then she may flag points as anomalies when in fact they are not."
- Break condition: If downstream methods are adapted to account for the modified cluster structure, or if the ML pipeline does not rely on cluster homogeneity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Clustering objectives (k-center, k-median, k-means)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different clustering objectives is essential for grasping how fairness constraints modify the optimization problem and affect the final clustering.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between k-center and k-median objectives in terms of what they minimize?

- Concept: Fairness constraints in clustering (CM, SF, EQ)
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses multiple fairness notions, and understanding their definitions and implications is crucial for analyzing the critique.
  - Quick check question: How does the Socially Fair (SF) clustering objective differ from the Proportional Color Mixing (CM) constraint?

- Concept: Utility and welfare modeling in algorithmic fairness
  - Why needed here: The paper's critique centers on how fair clustering algorithms can degrade utility and welfare, so understanding how to model these concepts is essential.
  - Quick check question: In the utility model uj(S, ϕ) = fj(dj, ϕ(j), L(ϕ, j)), what do the two input arguments to fj represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clustering algorithm -> Fairness constraints -> Clustering output -> Downstream ML pipeline
- Critical path: The critical path is the clustering algorithm → fairness constraint application → clustering output → downstream effect evaluation. Each step must be understood to assess the overall impact of fair clustering.
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between satisfying fairness constraints and optimizing for utility/welfare. Different fairness notions may have different tradeoffs, and there may be multiple optimal solutions with different welfare impacts.
- Failure signatures: Failure modes include (1) significant welfare degradation for individuals or groups, (2) inequitable welfare degradation across groups, and (3) unintended downstream effects in ML pipelines such as false outlier detection or compromised cluster homogeneity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple fair clustering algorithm (e.g., CM-constrained k-means) and compare its clustering output and welfare impact to an unconstrained baseline on a synthetic dataset with known structure.
  2. Analyze the multiple optimal solutions for a fairness-constrained clustering problem and compare their welfare impacts on different groups to demonstrate inequitable degradation.
  3. Apply an outlier detection method to the output of a fair clustering algorithm and compare the results to the same method applied to an unconstrained clustering to demonstrate potential false positives/negatives.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does imposing fairness constraints on clustering algorithms affect the long-term welfare of different demographic groups in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses potential negative impacts on social welfare due to fair clustering algorithms and mentions the importance of considering long-term effects, but does not provide empirical evidence from real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights theoretical concerns and potential issues, it does not offer concrete data from actual implementations to quantify the long-term welfare effects across different groups.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies comparing welfare outcomes in communities where fair clustering algorithms have been implemented versus those using traditional methods, controlling for other variables.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between the price of fairness (PoF) and the size and diversity of the dataset in practical fair clustering applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that PoF is measured according to the degradation in clustering cost but does not explore how dataset characteristics influence this metric in real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical understanding of PoF is limited to worst-case analysis, and there is a lack of empirical data on how it varies with different dataset properties in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies analyzing PoF across a wide range of datasets with varying sizes and demographic compositions, correlating these findings with theoretical predictions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can fair clustering algorithms be designed to minimize unintended downstream effects in machine learning pipelines, such as false positives in outlier detection or compromised cluster homogeneity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses potential unintended downstream effects of fair clustering in ML settings but does not provide solutions to mitigate these issues.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problems, it does not offer concrete strategies or frameworks to address these challenges without compromising the fairness objectives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of modified fair clustering algorithms that incorporate measures to preserve cluster homogeneity and reduce false positives, validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.

## Limitations

- Theoretical focus with limited empirical validation of claims
- Reliance on idealized assumptions about utility functions and group structures
- Lack of systematic quantification of how experimental limitations affect research conclusions

## Confidence

- High confidence: Claims about the importance of considering utility and welfare in fair clustering design, and the need for more representative datasets and applications
- Medium confidence: Theoretical arguments about potential welfare degradation and downstream effects, though empirical validation is limited
- Medium confidence: Critique of current experimental practices and datasets, which aligns with broader concerns in ML fairness research
- Low confidence: Specific claims about inequitable welfare degradation across groups, which require more rigorous mathematical analysis and empirical examples

## Next Checks

1. Implement concrete examples on synthetic datasets demonstrating cases where fair clustering degrades welfare more for one group than another, with quantitative measurements of the welfare differences
2. Conduct experiments on real-world datasets with downstream ML tasks to empirically measure the impact of fair clustering on outlier detection accuracy and classifier performance
3. Analyze multiple optimal solutions for a fairness-constrained clustering problem to systematically study the distribution of welfare impacts across groups and identify conditions under which inequitable degradation occurs
