# A Novel Hyperdimensional Computing Framework for Online Time Series Forecasting on the Edge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01999
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01999
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TSF-HD achieves RSE=0.097 vs. 0.538 for best baseline on Exchange dataset with τ=96, enabling efficient edge deployment with lower latency and power consumption.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TSF-HD, a hyperdimensional computing framework that reframes online time series forecasting as linear hyperdimensional learning. By mapping nonlinear low-dimensional time series data to high-dimensional spaces where linear regression becomes effective, the framework achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge devices. The approach uses a novel co-training method that jointly updates both the hyperdimensional encoder and linear regressor, enabling adaptation to shifting data distributions without explicit task-shift detection. Two variants are proposed: AR-HDC for higher accuracy and Seq2Seq-HDC for faster inference.

## Method Summary
TSF-HD maps multivariate time series data through a trainable encoder to a high-dimensional hyperspace where linear regression can be performed effectively. The framework uses a co-training approach where both the encoder and regressor weights are updated jointly using online gradient descent, allowing the system to adapt to concept drift. Two variants are introduced: AR-HDC uses an autoregressive formulation for iterative prediction that provides higher accuracy for long-term forecasting, while Seq2Seq-HDC uses a sequence-to-sequence approach for faster inference. The model operates in an online setting where it continuously updates its parameters as new data arrives, without requiring explicit task-shift detection.

## Key Results
- AR-HDC achieves RSE=0.097 vs. 0.538 for best baseline on Exchange dataset with τ=96
- TSF-HD shows significantly lower inference latency and power consumption on edge devices compared to deep learning baselines
- The framework demonstrates superior performance across both short-term (τ=3) and long-term (τ=96) forecasting horizons
- TSF-HD successfully adapts to synthetic abrupt dataset shifts without explicit task-shift detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Nonlinear low-dimensional time-series data can be mapped to high-dimensional spaces where linear regression becomes effective for forecasting.
- Mechanism: The framework leverages hyperdimensional computing principles where nonlinear relationships in low dimensions can be approximated as linear in high dimensions, enabling efficient linear regression on transformed data.
- Core assumption: Distance preservation and orthogonality properties hold when mapping low-dimensional nonlinear data to high-dimensional spaces using the proposed trainable encoder.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Nonlinear low-dimensional time-series data is mapped to high-dimensional (hyperdimensional) spaces for linear hyperdimensional prediction"
  - [section]: "the distances between x and y (x, y ∈ X ) are preserved under the encoder mapping H(.) within a scaling factor" and "for a non-trainable randomized projection matrix mapping X to H, the hypervectors that make up the matrix are ideally orthogonal"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus contains related hyperdimensional computing work but lacks direct validation of distance preservation in time series contexts.
- Break condition: If the encoder fails to preserve distances or maintain orthogonality during training, the linear approximation in high dimensions breaks down, leading to poor forecasting performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Co-training the encoder and regressor allows the system to adapt to shifting data distributions without explicit task-shift detection.
- Mechanism: The framework jointly updates both the hyperdimensional mapping (encoder) and the linear regressor using online gradient descent, allowing the system to evolve with the time series while maintaining prediction accuracy.
- Core assumption: Joint optimization of encoder and regressor weights can maintain the linearity of the mapping as the underlying data distribution changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our framework, TSF-HD, adapts to time-series distribution shifts using a novel co-training framework for its hyperdimensional mapping and its linear hyperdimensional predictor"
  - [section]: "Wr and br are updated in conjunction with We and be to minimize L( ˜Xt+1:t+τ − Xt+1:t+τ), using online gradient descent"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus shows hyperdimensional computing applications but lacks specific examples of co-training encoder and regressor for time series adaptation.
- Break condition: If the joint optimization fails to converge or causes the encoder to lose distance preservation properties, the system cannot effectively adapt to distribution shifts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Autoregressive formulation (AR-HDC) provides higher accuracy for long-term forecasting compared to sequence-to-sequence approaches.
- Mechanism: By predicting one time step ahead iteratively and feeding predictions back into the lookback window, the autoregressive approach captures temporal dependencies more effectively than one-shot prediction.
- Core assumption: Iterative prediction with feedback maintains better temporal coherence than direct multi-step prediction for longer horizons.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We provide a method for autoregressive time-series hyperdimensional time-series forecasting, allowing greater accuracy over long prediction horizons"
  - [section]: "AR-HDC is more accurate than Seq2Seq-HDC, but incurs higher overhead and is slower for long-term forecasting"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus contains general forecasting work but lacks specific validation of autoregressive vs sequence-to-sequence performance in hyperdimensional computing contexts.
- Break condition: If accumulated prediction errors in the autoregressive loop become too large, or if the overhead becomes prohibitive for practical deployment, the approach loses its advantage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hyperdimensional computing principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding how high-dimensional spaces can represent nonlinear relationships as linear is fundamental to grasping why this framework works
  - Quick check question: What property of high-dimensional spaces allows nonlinear functions to be approximated as linear?

- Concept: Online learning and concept drift adaptation
  - Why needed here: The framework operates in an online setting where data distributions shift, requiring continuous model updates without explicit task detection
  - Quick check question: How does the co-training approach differ from traditional online learning methods that use separate adaptation mechanisms?

- Concept: Time series forecasting metrics (RSE, CORR)
  - Why needed here: Evaluating model performance requires understanding these specific metrics used to compare forecasting accuracy
  - Quick check question: What does a lower RSE value indicate about forecasting performance compared to a naive baseline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Encoder (We, be) -> Regressor (Wr, br) -> Output layer
- Critical path:
  1. Receive new time series sample
  2. Update lookback window
  3. Encode input using current We, be
  4. Generate prediction using current Wr, br
  5. When true values become available, compute loss
  6. Update We, be, Wr, br using online gradient descent
  7. Repeat

- Design tradeoffs:
  - AR-HDC vs Seq2Seq-HDC: Higher accuracy vs lower latency
  - Hypervector dimension D: Larger D improves accuracy but increases computational cost
  - Update frequency: More frequent updates enable faster adaptation but increase computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Rapid increase in RSE during online learning phase
  - Loss of distance preservation between encoded vectors
  - Divergence of encoder hypervectors (loss of orthogonality)
  - High variance in predictions across multiple runs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run AR-HDC and Seq2Seq-HDC on synthetic abrupt dataset S-A to validate adaptation to task shifts
  2. Compare RSE convergence rates between TSF-HD and baseline models on Exchange dataset
  3. Measure inference latency and power consumption on Raspberry Pi for both short-term (τ=3) and long-term (τ=96) forecasting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of hyperdimensional dimension (D) beyond which performance gains plateau or degrade for TSF-HD?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "We fix the hypervector dimension at D = 1000" and shows performance changes across different dimensions in Table 4, but doesn't explore the upper bounds or identify a plateau point.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested up to D = 10k, leaving the question of optimal dimensionality unanswered, particularly for different dataset characteristics and forecasting horizons.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying D across multiple orders of magnitude (e.g., 1k to 1M) on diverse datasets, identifying the point where RSE improvement becomes negligible or begins to increase again.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does TSF-HD's performance degrade when facing concept drift that occurs faster than its periodic update frequency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes "TSF-HD is trained periodically" and shows adaptation to task shifts in synthetic data, but doesn't quantify performance degradation under rapid drift scenarios or compare against drift detection methods.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use a fixed update schedule without varying the drift rate or frequency, and don't compare against explicit drift detection approaches that could trigger immediate model updates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying drift rates from slow to extremely rapid, measuring RSE degradation over time, and comparing against adaptive update strategies that respond to drift indicators.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the minimum lookback window (T) required for TSF-HD to maintain accuracy across different time series characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses T = 2τ as a fixed parameter and mentions "the lookback window is fixed to twice the forecast horizon" but doesn't explore how T affects performance across different time series properties like seasonality, noise levels, or stationarity.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use a single fixed ratio (T:τ = 2:1) without exploring the sensitivity of this parameter to dataset characteristics, leaving uncertainty about optimal window sizing for different scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying T:τ ratios across datasets with different characteristics (seasonal vs. non-seasonal, noisy vs. clean, stationary vs. non-stationary), identifying minimum effective window sizes for each category.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance relies on maintaining distance preservation and orthogonality properties in high-dimensional space, which may degrade under certain data conditions or over extended training periods.
- The comparison with state-of-the-art baselines, while extensive, may not include all relevant deep learning approaches in time series forecasting, particularly transformer architectures.
- The paper doesn't explore the full range of edge hardware or real-world deployment scenarios, limiting understanding of practical deployment challenges.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of mapping nonlinear low-dimensional data to high-dimensional spaces for linear regression is well-established in hyperdimensional computing literature. The empirical results showing significant improvements over baselines are robust across multiple datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The co-training approach for adapting to distribution shifts is novel and shows promise, but the paper provides limited analysis of failure cases or scenarios where this approach might break down.
- **Medium Confidence**: The efficiency claims for edge deployment are supported by specific measurements, but the paper doesn't explore the full range of edge hardware or real-world deployment scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Distance Preservation Verification**: Implement monitoring of distance preservation between encoded vectors during training across all datasets to validate the core assumption of the hyperdimensional mapping approach.

2. **Orthogonality Stability Test**: Track cosine similarity between rows of the encoder weight matrix over extended training periods to verify that orthogonality is maintained and identify potential degradation points.

3. **Baseline Completeness Analysis**: Evaluate the framework against additional state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, particularly those using transformer architectures or other attention-based mechanisms that might challenge the reported performance advantages.
