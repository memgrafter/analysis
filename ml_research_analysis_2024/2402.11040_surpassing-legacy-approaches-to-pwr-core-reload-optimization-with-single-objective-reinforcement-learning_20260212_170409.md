# Surpassing legacy approaches to PWR core reload optimization with single-objective Reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11040
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11040
- Authors: Paul Seurin; Koroush Shirvan
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PPO statistically outperforms all SO methods in most scenarios, finding better or comparable solutions faster.

## Executive Summary
This paper compares Reinforcement Learning (RL) using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) against legacy Stochastic Optimization (SO) methods for optimizing Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) core loading patterns. The goal is to minimize Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) while satisfying operational and safety constraints. PPO leverages a learnable policy to adaptively balance global and local search, unlike SO methods which rely on predefined heuristics. Results show PPO statistically outperforms all SO methods in most scenarios, finding better or comparable solutions faster while demonstrating robustness and stability.

## Method Summary
The study uses single-objective optimization across five PWR design scenarios with varying symmetry and fuel batch sizes, ranging from 10^28 to 10^38 possible configurations. PPO leverages a learnable policy to adaptively balance global and local search, unlike SO methods which rely on predefined heuristics. The comparison is made against Genetic Algorithm (GA), Parallel Simulated Annealing (PSA), Tabu Search (TS), and an ensemble method (PESA). The core physics code SIMULATE3 is used to evaluate generated cores and provide rewards for the PPO algorithm.

## Key Results
- PPO statistically outperforms all SO methods in most scenarios, finding better or comparable solutions faster
- PPO consistently finds high-quality solutions with lower variance, demonstrating robustness and stability
- While ES and PESA show strong initial performance, they fail to improve sufficiently over longer runtimes
- TS and PSA, though steadily improving, are too slow and often get stuck in local optima

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PPO adapts its search strategy during optimization by learning a policy that transitions from global to local search based on the objective space curvature.
- Mechanism: PPO's learnable policy weights allow it to initially explore broadly (high stochasticity) and then refine search (low stochasticity) once promising regions are found.
- Core assumption: The objective space has differentiable regions where global search is needed early and local search later.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PPO adapts its search capability via a policy with learnable weights, allowing it to function as both a global and local search method."
  - [section]: "PPO initially behaves as a global search with a highly stochastic πθ, and then as a local search once promising directions in the objective space are identified through intelligent refinement of the weights θ."
  - [corpus]: Weak—corpus papers focus on other optimization contexts; no direct evidence of PPO adaptation in PWR optimization.
- Break condition: If the objective space is highly non-convex or discontinuous, PPO may not effectively learn the transition from global to local search.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PPO generates higher quality solutions with lower variance compared to SO methods.
- Mechanism: PPO's advantage function and policy gradient updates guide it toward consistently better solutions, reducing the likelihood of getting stuck in local optima.
- Core assumption: The advantage function accurately estimates the value of actions, leading to effective policy updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PPO consistently finds high-quality solutions with lower variance, demonstrating robustness and stability."
  - [section]: "PPO exhibits the highest mean and lowest standard deviation across the 10 experiments throughout all generations."
  - [corpus]: Weak—no direct evidence in corpus papers about variance reduction in PPO for optimization tasks.
- Break condition: If the reward signal is sparse or noisy, PPO's advantage estimation may be unreliable, leading to higher variance in solutions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PPO is more sample efficient than SO methods in finding feasible solutions.
- Mechanism: PPO's policy learning allows it to focus on promising regions of the search space, reducing the number of evaluations needed to find feasible solutions.
- Core assumption: The policy can effectively learn to avoid regions with low reward (infeasible solutions).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PPO consistently finds high-quality solutions... faster."
  - [section]: "PPO is clearly the best algorithm for the defined scenarios... PPO consistently generates feasible solutions from around generation 170 (approximately 42,500 samples)."
  - [corpus]: Weak—no direct evidence in corpus papers about sample efficiency of PPO in PWR optimization.
- Break condition: If the search space is extremely large or the constraints are very complex, PPO may still require a large number of samples to find feasible solutions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: PPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm that operates within the framework of MDPs to learn optimal policies.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of an MDP, and how do they relate to the PWR loading pattern optimization problem?

- Concept: Policy Gradient Methods
  - Why needed here: PPO is a policy gradient method that updates the policy parameters to maximize expected reward.
  - Quick check question: How does the policy gradient update work in PPO, and what is the role of the advantage function?

- Concept: Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm Basics
  - Why needed here: The paper compares PPO against SA and GA, so understanding their mechanisms is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between SA and GA, and how do they navigate the search space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PPO agent -> Reactor physics code (SIMULATE3) -> Reward calculation -> Policy update -> Next pattern generation
- Critical path: PPO → SIMULATE3 → Reward calculation → Policy update → Next pattern generation
- Design tradeoffs: PPO vs. SO methods (SA, GA, TS) in terms of sample efficiency, solution quality, and robustness
- Failure signatures: PPO may get stuck in local optima if the reward signal is sparse or the policy learning is unstable. SO methods may converge slowly or get trapped in poor local optima.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement PPO on a simple benchmark problem to verify its basic functionality.
  2. Compare PPO's performance against a basic SA implementation on the PWR loading pattern problem.
  3. Analyze the policy learned by PPO to understand how it adapts its search strategy during optimization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does PPO's performance compare to legacy methods when initialized with a known good solution in the PWR LP optimization context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that while literature suggests PPO surpasses classical heuristics even when initialized with a known good solution, they have not tested this in the PWR LP optimization context.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing PPO against legacy methods without any prior knowledge of good solutions, which is a more realistic scenario but leaves the performance gap unexplored when starting from an advantageous position.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing PPO's performance against legacy methods when both are initialized with a known good solution, measuring convergence speed and final solution quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of processors to use for PPO and ES to maximize their performance in PWR LP optimization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that access to a larger number of processors would be beneficial for PESA, PPO, and ES, but they leave a study with a greater number of processors for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a fixed number of processors for each algorithm, and the optimal parallelization strategy for PPO and ES is not explored, which could significantly impact their performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying the number of processors for PPO and ES, measuring their performance in terms of solution quality and convergence speed, to identify the optimal parallelization strategy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of PPO and legacy methods vary across different PWR designs and constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the PWR LP optimization problem involves numerous trade-offs and that the constraints and objectives vary from one reactor to the next, but they only test their methods on a limited set of PWR designs.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on a specific set of PWR designs and constraints, and it is unclear how well the methods generalize to other reactor types and operational scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the performance of PPO and legacy methods across a diverse set of PWR designs and constraints, measuring their ability to find feasible and high-quality solutions.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks explicit hyperparameter details for both PPO and the SO methods, requiring extensive tuning for faithful reproduction
- The comparison against only four specific SO methods may not generalize to other optimization approaches
- The study uses a single reactor physics code (SIMULATE3), limiting generalizability to other core design tools

## Confidence

- PPO outperforms SO methods: **High** - Results are statistically significant with clear performance gaps across multiple scenarios
- PPO's adaptive search advantage: **Medium** - The mechanism is theoretically sound but empirical evidence of policy adaptation is limited
- PPO's sample efficiency: **Medium** - While PPO finds feasible solutions faster, the exact efficiency gains depend on hyperparameter tuning
- Robustness and lower variance: **High** - Multiple experiments show consistent performance with lower standard deviation

## Next Checks

1. Implement hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for PPO and SO methods to identify optimal configurations and understand robustness to parameter choices
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of PPO's policy adaptation versus its sample efficiency advantages
3. Test PPO on additional PWR scenarios with different constraint sets and objective functions to evaluate generalizability beyond the studied cases
