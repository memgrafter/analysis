# Pluralistic Alignment Over Time

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.10654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10654
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Proposes temporal pluralism framework for evaluating AI alignment with multiple stakeholders over time through sequential decision-making

## Executive Summary
This position paper introduces temporal pluralism as an approach to evaluating AI alignment with multiple stakeholders who may have conflicting values. The framework argues that alignment should be considered over time rather than requiring simultaneous satisfaction of all stakeholder values. By using stakeholder status functions, extended aggregation functions, and filter functions, the system can reflect different stakeholders' values at different times through sequential decision-making. The authors adapt their previous framework for temporally extended fairness to pluralistic alignment, allowing for long-term, periodic, and anytime evaluations of alignment quality.

## Method Summary
The method involves computing temporal pluralism scores through a framework that combines stakeholder status functions, extended aggregation functions, and filter functions. Stakeholder status functions measure alignment quality for each stakeholder given a trajectory, extended aggregation functions combine these statuses over time, and filter functions select which time points to consider. The framework allows for different temporal evaluation schemes (long-term, periodic, anytime) and suggests using non-Markovian reward functions to represent temporally extended preferences and norms. The approach is primarily theoretical at this stage, with the authors noting that further work is needed to investigate specific temporal pluralism schemes and their practical implementation.

## Key Results
- Temporal pluralism allows AI systems to reflect different stakeholders' values at different times through sequential decision-making
- The framework enables long-term, periodic, and anytime evaluations of pluralistic alignment using filter functions
- Non-Markovian reward functions can represent temporally extended preferences and norms for better alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal pluralism allows an AI system to achieve pluralistic alignment over time by reflecting different stakeholders' values at different times through sequential decision-making.
- Mechanism: The temporal pluralism scheme aggregates stakeholder status functions over time using extended aggregation functions and filter functions, allowing the system to evaluate alignment across different time periods and adjust decisions accordingly.
- Core assumption: Different stakeholders' values can be satisfied at different times without requiring simultaneous satisfaction, and the system can plan ahead to achieve this temporal distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "temporal pluralism, where the AI system reflects different stakeholders' values at different times through sequential decision-making"
  - [section] "temporal pluralism, wherein the system reflects different stakeholders' values at different times"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on pluralistic alignment but don't provide direct evidence for temporal mechanisms

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework allows for long-term, periodic, and anytime evaluations of pluralistic alignment through different temporal pluralism schemes.
- Mechanism: By using filter functions that select different time points (all times for long-term, multiples of period for periodic, every time for anytime), the system can evaluate alignment under different temporal granularities and adjust behavior accordingly.
- Core assumption: Different temporal evaluation schemes are appropriate for different decision-making contexts and can provide meaningful feedback about alignment quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "As Alamdari et al. noted, temporal pluralism schemes allow for long-term, periodic, and anytime evaluations"
  - [section] "Long-term...Periodic...Anytime An anytime temporal pluralism scheme is a periodic scheme with period 1"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't provide specific examples of temporal evaluation schemes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-Markovian reward functions can represent temporally extended preferences and norms, enabling better alignment with stakeholders' temporal preferences.
- Mechanism: By using reward machines or temporal logics to define rewards based on whole trajectories rather than individual state-action pairs, the system can reward temporally extended behaviors like "dessert after main course" or other sequential preferences.
- Core assumption: Stakeholders' preferences often involve temporal dependencies that cannot be captured by Markovian reward functions, and non-Markovian representations can effectively encode these dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Non-Markovian reward functions have been described using temporal logics including LTL... and reward machines"
  - [section] "An example reward machine is shown in Figure 2" (rewarding dessert after main course)
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - corpus includes papers on temporal preferences and reward functions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal logics and reward machines
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on non-Markovian reward functions to represent temporally extended preferences and norms, which can be expressed using temporal logics like LTL or reward machines
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the preference "always wear a seatbelt when driving" using a reward machine structure?

- Concept: Social welfare aggregation functions
  - Why needed here: The extended aggregation function combines stakeholder status across time to compute a temporal pluralism score, requiring understanding of different social welfare approaches like Nash welfare
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between using Nash welfare versus utilitarian welfare in the extended aggregation function, and how might this affect temporal pluralism evaluation?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning with explicit memory
  - Why needed here: The framework suggests using reinforcement learning approaches with explicit memory to handle the temporal dependencies and planning requirements for achieving high temporal pluralism scores
  - Quick check question: Why would a reinforcement learning agent need explicit memory to optimize for temporal pluralism, and what memory mechanisms might be appropriate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Stakeholder status function (U) → Extended aggregation function (Wex) → Filter function (B) → Temporal pluralism score
- Critical path: Input trajectory → Stakeholder status computation → Time filtering → Aggregation → Score output
- Design tradeoffs: Computational complexity vs. temporal granularity (finer filters provide more detailed evaluation but require more computation), Markovian vs. non-Markovian reward functions (simpler but less expressive vs. more complex but more accurate temporal representation)
- Failure signatures: Poor alignment scores despite stakeholder satisfaction at individual time points, computational bottlenecks in aggregation functions, inability to plan ahead for temporal distribution of stakeholder satisfaction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple restaurant booking scenario with 3 stakeholders having different cuisine preferences, evaluate temporal pluralism using a basic filter function that considers every 10th booking
  2. Compare Markovian vs. non-Markovian reward representations for a "dessert after main course" preference scenario, measure impact on alignment scores
  3. Test different aggregation functions (Nash welfare vs. utilitarian) on a multi-stakeholder scheduling problem with temporally extended preferences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can temporal pluralism schemes be designed to account for stakeholders' temporally extended preferences about the overall timeline, as discussed in Section 1.2?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that stakeholders may have preferences about how the state evolves over time, such as wanting dessert served after the main course, and suggests that this could complicate temporal pluralism schemes.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this issue but does not provide specific guidance on how to incorporate such preferences into temporal pluralism schemes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing temporal pluralism schemes that explicitly incorporate stakeholders' preferences about the timeline, and demonstrating their effectiveness in aligning AI systems with these preferences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific temporal pluralism schemes would be most appropriate for aggregating people's preferences in real-world scenarios, such as the restaurant booking example in Section 2?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that further work is needed to investigate what specific temporal pluralism schemes would be most appropriate for aggregating people's preferences.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a framework for temporal pluralism, it does not offer concrete examples or guidelines for choosing appropriate schemes in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different temporal pluralism schemes in various real-world scenarios, and identifying the most effective schemes for different types of preference aggregation problems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can AI systems be designed to remember and use past information to achieve high temporal pluralism scores, as mentioned in the conclusion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that an AI system trying to act so as to bring about a trajectory with a high temporal pluralism score would in general need to be able to remember some information about the past, but further work is needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific approaches or algorithms for enabling AI systems to remember and use past information in this context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing reinforcement learning approaches or other AI techniques that enable systems to effectively remember and use past information to achieve high temporal pluralism scores in various scenarios.

## Limitations
- The framework is primarily theoretical without empirical validation or specific metrics for measuring temporal pluralism scores
- Assumes stakeholder values can be satisfied at different times without requiring simultaneous satisfaction, which may not hold for all alignment scenarios
- Computational complexity of non-Markovian reward functions and temporal evaluation schemes is not addressed, potentially limiting practical applicability

## Confidence

**High**: The need for temporal considerations in pluralistic alignment is well-established and the conceptual framework for temporal pluralism is coherent

**Medium**: The mechanisms for aggregating stakeholder status over time using extended aggregation functions are theoretically sound but lack empirical validation

**Low**: The specific implementation details for stakeholder status functions, extended aggregation functions, and filter functions are not specified, making practical application uncertain

## Next Checks

1. Implement a simulation with three stakeholders having conflicting preferences and test whether temporal pluralism schemes can achieve higher overall alignment scores compared to simultaneous satisfaction approaches

2. Compare the computational complexity and alignment accuracy of Markovian vs. non-Markovian reward functions in a temporally extended preference scenario

3. Conduct user studies to validate whether temporal distribution of stakeholder satisfaction is perceived as acceptable alignment compared to traditional approaches
