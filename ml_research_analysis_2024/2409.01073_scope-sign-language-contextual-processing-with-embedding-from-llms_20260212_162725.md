# SCOPE: Sign Language Contextual Processing with Embedding from LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.01073
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01073
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: Novel context-aware SLR/SLT framework using LLM embeddings achieves SOTA performance on Phoenix-2014T, CSL-Daily, and new SCOPE dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SCOPE, a novel context-aware vision-based sign language recognition and translation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to incorporate dialogue context. The authors address the challenge of limited contextual information in existing sign language datasets by creating a new dataset of 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos with rich contextual dialogue annotations. SCOPE employs an embedding alignment module to integrate contextual information from LLMs into sign language recognition, followed by Q-LoRA fine-tuning for translation. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with significant improvements in WER and BLEU scores, validated through user studies with the Deaf community.

## Method Summary
SCOPE introduces a two-stage approach for sign language processing. First, it extracts keypoint sequences from sign language videos and aligns them with LLM-generated contextual embeddings through a motion-text embedding alignment module. This alignment enables the model to incorporate rich contextual information from preceding dialogue. The aligned embeddings are then processed through a transformer encoder with CTC decoding for sign language recognition (SLR). For sign language translation (SLT), the framework uses Q-LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, incorporating the top-3 gloss predictions and contextual text as inputs to generate spoken language translations.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art WER of 18.0 on Phoenix-2014T and 20.3 on CSL-Daily for sign language recognition
- Improves BLEU-4 score from 27.3 to 31.5 and ROUGE-L from 52.1 to 54.3 on CSL-Daily for translation
- New SCOPE dataset with 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos shows 15.7% relative WER improvement over context-free baselines
- User studies with Deaf community demonstrate effective real-world application performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aligning motion embeddings with LLM-generated contextual embeddings improves SLR performance by providing richer linguistic context.
- Mechanism: The embedding alignment encoder maps visual motion features into the same embedding space as the LLM-generated sentence embeddings, enabling the model to fuse contextual semantic information with visual motion cues.
- Core assumption: The LLM embeddings effectively capture the semantic context of the preceding dialogue that is relevant to the current sign.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "For SLR, we utilize dialogue contexts through a multi-modal encoder to enhance gloss-level recognition."
  - [section]: "The key idea is to directly learn the alignment between the linguistic features of sign language motion and the contextual features of text."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus; assumption based on LLM success in NLP.
- Break condition: If the LLM embeddings are noisy or irrelevant to the sign content, alignment would introduce noise rather than useful context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning an LLM with Q-LoRA for SLT improves translation quality by leveraging contextual information from previous dialogue.
- Mechanism: The fine-tuned LLM uses top-3 gloss predictions and contextual text as input, generating more accurate and contextually appropriate spoken language translations.
- Core assumption: The LLM can effectively integrate gloss and context information to produce fluent translations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "For subsequent SLT, we further fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) by incorporating prior conversational context."
  - [section]: "We use the gloss output from the previous SLR module and the contextual text as inputs and adopt Q-LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a pretrained LLM model."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus mentions "LLMs are Good Sign Language Translators" but lacks detail on fine-tuning specifics.
- Break condition: If the gloss predictions are inaccurate or the context is irrelevant, the LLM may generate incorrect translations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The SCOPE dataset's contextual annotations enable the development of context-aware sign language processing models.
- Mechanism: The dataset provides video footage, gloss annotations, and dialogue texts for sign language videos, allowing models to learn the relationship between signs and their conversational context.
- Core assumption: The contextual information in the dataset is accurate and comprehensive enough to train robust models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We also contribute a new sign language dataset that contains 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos in contextual dialogues across various scenarios."
  - [section]: "Our dataset covers a wide range of both daily and professional conversations... For each sequence, we provide video footage, gloss annotations, and dialogue texts."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence; assumption based on dataset description.
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks sufficient diversity or the annotations are noisy, the models may not generalize well.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Motion feature extraction -> SLR -> SLT
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Motion feature extraction → SLR → SLT
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LLM embeddings adds computational overhead but provides rich context.
  - Fine-tuning with Q-LoRA reduces memory usage but may limit model capacity.
  - Iris normalization improves keypoint consistency but adds preprocessing complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor SLR performance: Inaccurate motion feature extraction or alignment.
  - Poor SLT performance: Inaccurate gloss predictions or irrelevant context.
  - Slow inference: Large model size or inefficient fine-tuning.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the embedding alignment encoder with a simple motion feature set and fixed context embeddings.
  2. Evaluate the gloss embedding encoder with aligned motion and context embeddings.
  3. Fine-tune the LLM with a small set of gloss and context pairs to assess translation quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework handle excessively long dialogue contexts without losing focus on the current sentence?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "excessively long contexts may have minimal impact on current sentences" and suggest that "investigating an attention decay mechanism should be a future research direction."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or implementation details regarding handling long contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the model with different context lengths, or a proposed method for implementing an attention decay mechanism and its evaluation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the model be adapted to handle variations in sign speed among different signers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that "variations in sign speed among signers can complicate the recognition network's ability to process sign frames effectively."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss any methods or experiments to address sign speed variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a speed normalization technique and experimental results showing improved recognition accuracy across signers with varying speeds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the SCOPE framework compare to human interpreters in real-world scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper presents user studies with the Deaf community and real-time applications, it does not compare the model's performance to human interpreters.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on technical improvements and user feedback but does not include a comparison with professional human interpreters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the accuracy and efficiency of the SCOPE framework to professional human interpreters in various real-world scenarios, such as medical appointments or educational settings.

## Limitations

- Quality and diversity of the SCOPE dataset remain unclear, with potential issues in annotation consistency and coverage of sign language variation.
- Reliance on OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 may limit domain adaptation for sign language-specific contexts and cultural references.
- Framework's generalizability to other sign languages and contexts is untested, as the paper focuses exclusively on Chinese sign language.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical feasibility of using embedding alignment to integrate contextual information with motion features.
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of Q-LoRA fine-tuning for sign language translation with limited data.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of the SCOPE framework to other sign languages and contexts.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of the SCOPE dataset to evaluate annotation consistency, contextual relevance, and coverage of sign language variation.
2. Test the SCOPE framework on sign language datasets from different languages to assess adaptability and identify language-specific limitations.
3. Perform systematic ablation experiments removing contextual components to quantify their exact contribution to performance improvements.
