# Bayesian Networks for Causal Analysis in Socioecological Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10101
- Reference count: 20
- One-line primary result: Novel application of counterfactual reasoning to socioecological systems using Bayesian networks and structural causal models, revealing necessity and sufficiency relationships between socioeconomic factors and land-use patterns.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for applying counterfactual reasoning to socioecological systems using Bayesian networks and structural causal models. The authors employ the EMCC method to analyze necessity and sufficiency relations between variables in a case study involving socioeconomic factors and land-uses in southern Spain. By leveraging observational data, they successfully compute counterfactual queries, providing insights into the causal relationships within the system and demonstrating the potential of counterfactual reasoning for uncovering complex interactions in socioecological systems.

## Method Summary
The method employs structural causal models (SCMs) to represent socioecological systems, extending Bayesian networks with exogenous variables. The EMCC (Expectation Maximization for Causal Computation) algorithm is used to estimate parameters from observational data, handling latent exogenous variables. Counterfactual queries (PN, PS, PNS, PNrc) are computed to determine necessity and sufficiency of variables on land-use and population growth outcomes. The approach is applied to a dataset of 75 municipalities in Andalusia, Spain, with 17 variables representing land-use, social, and economic factors.

## Key Results
- Location and population density are key determinants of land-use patterns in the studied socioecological system
- Immigration plays a significant role in population growth, as revealed by counterfactual analysis
- The EMCC method successfully computes probability intervals for counterfactual queries, providing actionable insights for environmental management and policy-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) enable counterfactual reasoning by representing both observed and unobserved variables in a unified graphical framework.
- Mechanism: SCMs extend Bayesian networks by introducing exogenous variables that capture hidden causes, allowing computation of counterfactual queries such as necessity and sufficiency.
- Core assumption: The causal graph is correctly specified and all endogenous variables have exactly one exogenous parent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Structural causal models are probabilistic models for causal analysis that simplify this kind of reasoning due to their graphical representation. They can be regarded as extensions of the so-called Bayesian networks"
  - [section] "SCMs can be regarded as Bayesian networks that have been extended to accommodate the exogenous variables"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct neighbor discussion of SCM/BN extension
- Break condition: If the causal graph structure is misspecified or violates the Markovian assumption, counterfactual inferences become unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The EMCC method enables parameter estimation for SCMs when only observational data is available.
- Mechanism: EMCC extends the EM algorithm to handle latent exogenous variables, providing bounded probability intervals for counterfactual queries instead of point estimates.
- Core assumption: The latent variable distributions can be approximated via iterative expectation-maximization without exact identifiability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the recent method expectation-maximization for causal computation (EMCC) is proposed to be used for counterfactual reasoning"
  - [section] "we propose the utilization of the innovative technique known as EMCC (Expectation Maximization for Causal Computation)"
  - [corpus] Weak - no neighbor papers discuss EMCC or latent variable EM variants
- Break condition: If the model structure leads to non-identifiable queries, EMCC can only provide uninformative wide intervals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Counterfactual queries reveal causal necessity and sufficiency relationships that standard Bayesian network analysis cannot detect.
- Mechanism: By computing probability intervals for PN, PS, and PNS, the framework quantifies the degree to which causes are required or sufficient for effects, distinguishing between observational correlation and causal impact.
- Core assumption: The causal structure correctly encodes the true dependencies, enabling meaningful counterfactual comparisons.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "analyze the relations of necessity and sufficiency between the variables of a socioecological system using counterfactual reasoning with Bayesian networks"
  - [section] "we analyze the relations of necessity and sufficiency between the variables in the aforementioned socioecological system"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors focus on other applications of counterfactuals but do not validate necessity/sufficiency metrics
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks sufficient variation or the model is too constrained, the probability intervals will be too wide to be actionable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
  - Why needed here: SCMs are the formal foundation enabling counterfactual reasoning by representing both observed and unobserved causes in a unified graphical model.
  - Quick check question: How does an SCM differ from a standard Bayesian network in terms of variable representation?

- Concept: Counterfactual reasoning (PN, PS, PNS metrics)
  - Why needed here: These metrics quantify causal necessity and sufficiency, revealing relationships that observational analysis cannot detect.
  - Quick check question: What does a high PNS value indicate about the relationship between two variables?

- Concept: EMCC (Expectation Maximization for Causal Computation)
  - Why needed here: EMCC allows parameter learning for SCMs when only observational data is available, handling latent exogenous variables.
  - Quick check question: Why can't standard EM be directly applied to SCMs with latent exogenous variables?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Observational dataset -> DAG -> SCM -> EMCC training -> Counterfactual queries -> Results
- Critical path: Data → DAG → SCM → EMCC training → Counterfactual queries → Results
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. computational feasibility (limit parents to 3 to avoid exponential state explosion)
  - Identifiability vs. informative bounds (wider intervals for unidentifiable queries)
  - Expert specification vs. automated learning (DAG construction)
- Failure signatures:
  - Very wide probability intervals → model may be unidentifiable or data insufficient
  - Inconsistent results across EM runs → convergence issues or poor initialization
  - Counterintuitive necessity/sufficiency patterns → potential DAG misspecification
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate that the learned SCM reproduces the original BN's observational probabilities
  2. Test counterfactual queries on a simple synthetic dataset with known ground truth
  3. Apply the full pipeline to a subset of variables to check computational tractability before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the cardinality of exogenous variables grow with the number of parents in SCMs, and what are the practical computational limits for real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the exponential growth of exogenous variable cardinality with the number of parents (equation A.1) and provides an example where 6 parents result in over 18 quintillion possible outcomes.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges this as a limitation, it does not provide specific thresholds or guidelines for when this becomes computationally intractable in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies testing the computational limits of SCMs with varying numbers of parents and variables, and benchmarking against alternative methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the results of counterfactual analysis in socioecological systems differ from traditional Bayesian network analysis, and what specific insights does counterfactual reasoning provide that are not captured by other methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper contrasts counterfactual analysis with traditional BN analysis, highlighting the ability of counterfactual reasoning to determine necessity and sufficiency relationships. However, it does not provide a direct comparison of results from both methods on the same dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the potential of counterfactual reasoning but does not explicitly compare its findings with those obtained from traditional BN analysis on the same case study.
- What evidence would resolve it: A side-by-side comparison of results from counterfactual analysis and traditional BN analysis on the same socioecological dataset, highlighting the unique insights provided by counterfactual reasoning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can counterfactual reasoning be extended to handle multiple cause variables simultaneously, and what are the implications for policy-making in socioecological systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that further research could explore counterfactual queries with multiple cause variables, suggesting the potential for joint sufficiency analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on single cause variables in its case study and does not explore the complexities and implications of analyzing multiple cause variables simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies applying counterfactual reasoning to socioecological systems with multiple interacting cause variables, and analyses of how these results inform policy decisions.

## Limitations
- The study relies on a pre-specified causal DAG that was not empirically validated, introducing potential bias in counterfactual inferences.
- EMCC provides bounded intervals rather than point estimates, which may be too wide to be actionable for some queries, especially with limited data (75 municipalities).
- The model assumes Markovian SCMs (each endogenous variable has exactly one exogenous parent), which may oversimplify complex socioecological interactions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical foundation of using SCMs for counterfactual reasoning and the mathematical validity of necessity/sufficiency metrics
- **Medium confidence**: The EMCC implementation and parameter estimation procedure; the Markovian assumption's applicability to socioecological systems
- **Low confidence**: The precision of specific counterfactual probability intervals given limited observational data

## Next Checks

1. Perform sensitivity analysis by testing alternative DAG structures and comparing resulting counterfactual intervals to assess robustness to causal assumptions
2. Validate the approach on synthetic datasets with known ground truth to benchmark the accuracy and precision of EMCC's probability intervals
3. Apply the method to a larger, more diverse dataset to test scalability and whether probability intervals narrow with increased sample size
