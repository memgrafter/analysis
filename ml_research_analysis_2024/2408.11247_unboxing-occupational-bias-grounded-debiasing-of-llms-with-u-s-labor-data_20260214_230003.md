# Unboxing Occupational Bias: Grounded Debiasing of LLMs with U.S. Labor Data

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Simple few-shot prompting with U.S. labor data reduces LLM occupational bias by 65% on average

## Executive Summary
This study addresses occupational bias in large language models by grounding evaluation and debiasing in authoritative U.S. labor statistics. The authors developed a bias analysis framework that compares LLM outputs to U.S. National Bureau of Labor Statistics (NBLS) data across seven models. Using zero-shot and few-shot prompting with 2,500 samples, they found significant bias in LLMs, with generated occupations often diverging from NBLS distributions. A simple debiasing method incorporating 32 NBLS-based examples via few-shot prompting reduced bias scores by an average of 65%, demonstrating the effectiveness of grounding LLMs in authoritative labor data.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates seven LLMs (Falcon, GPT-Neo, Mixtral, Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5) using 2,500 mixed-format samples across three task types. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting approaches are tested, with few-shot examples drawn from U.S. NBLS occupational data. Bias is quantified by comparing LLM output distributions to NBLS distributions using statistical tests (KS test, ANOVA). A debiasing method incorporating 32 NBLS-based examples is applied, and self-debiasing via explanation is also explored to reduce bias without external datasets.

## Key Results
- Seven LLMs showed significant occupational bias when outputs were compared to NBLS distributions
- Simple few-shot prompting with 32 NBLS examples achieved 65% average reduction in bias scores
- Statistical validation (KS test, ANOVA) confirmed significant differences between biased and debiased outputs
- Open-source and closed-source models both benefited from NBLS-grounded debiasing approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incorporating authoritative labor statistics directly into LLM prompts reduces bias by providing factual reference points that counteract stereotypical associations learned during pretraining.
- Mechanism: Few-shot prompting with real-world occupational data from U.S. NBLS serves as an in-context grounding signal that overrides default model behavior tied to biased training distributions.
- Core assumption: The LLM's in-context learning capability can absorb and apply the factual occupational distributions provided in the few-shot examples to produce less biased outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A simple debiasing method was proposed, incorporating 32 NBLS-based examples via few-shot prompting, which reduced bias scores by an average of 65%."
  - [section]: "To address these biases, we designed a simple yet effective prompting method using contextual examples from U.S. NBLS data. With just 32 examples, we achieved, on average, a notable 65% reduction in bias."
  - [corpus]: Weak correlation with other studies; this approach appears novel in directly grounding LLM outputs to authoritative labor data.
- Break condition: If the LLM's few-shot learning is overwhelmed by its pretraining bias or if the examples provided are too few or poorly chosen, the grounding effect may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Comparing LLM outputs to authoritative statistical benchmarks (NBLS) enables objective quantification of bias that is more reliable than synthetic or crowdsourced datasets.
- Mechanism: Statistical comparison (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, ANOVA) between predicted occupational distributions and NBLS distributions reveals the magnitude and significance of bias.
- Core assumption: NBLS data accurately reflects unbiased occupational distributions that can serve as a valid ground truth for measuring LLM bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The authors developed a bias analysis framework that compares LLM outputs to U.S. National Bureau of Labor Statistics (NBLS) data across seven models."
  - [section]: "We conduct empirical research that evaluates LLMs in a 'bias-out-of-the-box' setting, analyzing how the generated outputs compare with the distributions found in NBLS data."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct support; this approach appears distinct from prior bias measurement methods that rely on synthetic datasets.
- Break condition: If NBLS data itself contains historical biases or if the comparison metrics are not sensitive enough to capture subtle forms of bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-debiasing through explanation enables LLMs to recognize and correct their own biased outputs without requiring retraining or external models.
- Mechanism: Prompting the LLM to first generate an answer, then prompting it again to identify and remove stereotypes, effectively reduces bias in the final output.
- Core assumption: The LLM has sufficient introspective capability to recognize stereotypes in its own outputs and modify them accordingly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Self-debiasing via explanation type of prompting asks the model to identify stereotypes and avoid such before answering the query. Meanwhile, self-debiasing via explanation prompts the model to answer the query normally, and after the answer is received, we re-prompt it to remove any stereotype or bias in the answer."
  - [abstract]: "Importantly, our debiasing method, which does not rely on external datasets, demonstrates a substantial reduction in bias scores."
  - [corpus]: Weak support; this method is mentioned but not deeply validated in the corpus.
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks the capability to recognize its own biases or if the explanation prompts are not specific enough to guide correction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: The study relies on few-shot prompting to provide NBLS-based examples to the LLMs for debiasing.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting, and why might few-shot be more effective for debiasing?

- Concept: Statistical bias measurement
  - Why needed here: The study uses statistical tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) to compare LLM outputs to NBLS data for bias quantification.
  - Quick check question: How do the KS test and ANOVA test differ in their approach to measuring distributional differences?

- Concept: In-context learning
  - Why needed here: The debiasing relies on the LLM's ability to learn from the provided NBLS examples within the context of the prompt.
  - Quick check question: What factors influence the effectiveness of in-context learning in LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: U.S. NBLS occupational data -> 2,500 synthetic prompt samples -> 7 LLMs (Falcon, GPT-Neo, Mixtral, Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5) -> Zero-shot and few-shot prompts -> Bias score calculation -> Statistical tests (KS, ANOVA) -> Debiasing (self-debiasing via explanation, context example incorporation)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate prompt data (2,500 samples across 3 task types)
  2. Run zero-shot prompting on all 7 LLMs
  3. Run few-shot prompting with NBLS examples
  4. Calculate bias scores and run statistical tests
  5. Implement self-debiasing via explanation
  6. Evaluate debiasing effectiveness

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of NBLS examples: More examples may improve debiasing but increase prompt length and cost.
  - Choice of LLMs: Open-source vs. closed-source models may have different biases and debiasing effectiveness.
  - Prompt format: Different prompt formats may be more or less effective for different LLMs.

- Failure signatures:
  - No reduction in bias score after debiasing
  - LLM fails to generate responses for certain prompts
  - Statistical tests show no significant difference between LLM outputs and NBLS data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run zero-shot prompting on all 7 LLMs and calculate baseline bias scores.
  2. Run few-shot prompting with 2-shot examples and compare bias scores to baseline.
  3. Run few-shot prompting with 32-shot examples and compare bias scores to previous runs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective are the proposed debiasing methods when applied to more diverse and complex occupations beyond the ones tested in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors tested their debiasing method on a limited set of occupations and found it effective, but did not explore its effectiveness on a broader range of occupations.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on a specific set of occupations, and it is unclear if the debiasing method would be equally effective for a wider variety of occupations, especially those that are less common or more specialized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting further experiments with a more diverse set of occupations, including less common and specialized ones, and evaluating the effectiveness of the debiasing method on these occupations would provide insights into its generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term effects of the proposed debiasing method on the overall performance and capabilities of the LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors demonstrated that their debiasing method reduced bias in LLMs, but they did not investigate the potential impact on the models' overall performance and capabilities.
- Why unresolved: While reducing bias is important, it is crucial to ensure that the debiasing process does not negatively affect the models' ability to perform other tasks or generate accurate and relevant responses in various contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of the debiasing method on the models' performance across different tasks and domains would provide insights into its impact on the models' overall capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed debiasing method be adapted and applied to other languages and cultural contexts beyond the U.S. context?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors focused on U.S. labor data and cultural context, and it is unclear if the debiasing method can be effectively adapted and applied to other languages and cultural contexts.
- Why unresolved: Bias and stereotypes can vary across different languages and cultures, and a debiasing method that works well in one context may not be equally effective in others.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with LLMs trained on data from different languages and cultural contexts, and adapting the debiasing method to incorporate relevant authoritative data from those contexts, would provide insights into its generalizability across different languages and cultures.

## Limitations
- The approach's dependency on authoritative labor statistics that may not be available for all regions or domains
- Potential overfitting to the specific NBLS distributions used for training examples
- Limited evaluation of long-term stability of debiased outputs across extended conversations or contexts

## Confidence

High confidence: Effectiveness of NBLS-grounded few-shot prompting for reducing occupational bias, supported by robust statistical analysis and consistent results across seven diverse LLMs.

Medium confidence: Generalizability of findings beyond U.S. labor data contexts, as the debiasing approach is specifically anchored to NBLS statistics.

Low confidence: Method's scalability to other types of bias (e.g., intersectional bias) not explicitly addressed in the study.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-cultural validation: Test the debiasing approach using labor statistics from different countries (e.g., UK Office for National Statistics, World Bank labor data) to assess generalizability beyond U.S. data.

2. Temporal stability analysis: Evaluate whether the debiased outputs remain stable over multiple interactions and contexts, measuring bias persistence after 10+ consecutive prompts in varied scenarios.

3. Bias type expansion: Extend the evaluation framework to measure intersectional biases (e.g., gender + ethnicity combined) and compare effectiveness of debiasing across different bias categories using the same NBLS-grounded approach.
