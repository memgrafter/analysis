# Evaluating Dialect Robustness of Language Models via Conversation Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.05688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05688

- All models perform significantly better on US English than Indian English, with a 12.66 point similarity gap and 17.4 point accuracy gap across all configurations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel evaluation methodology for assessing dialect robustness of language models using conversation-based tasks derived from a word-guessing game. The authors extend the MD3 dataset to create M-MD3, masking target words in dialogues between US English and Indian English speakers. Two tasks are evaluated: target word prediction and target word selection. Experiments with three models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama3) show that all models perform significantly better on US English than Indian English, with GPT-4 performing best pre-training and Llama3 after fine-tuning. The evaluation demonstrates marginalization against Indian English dialect, with error analysis showing that fine-tuning improves performance on Indian English conversations.

## Method Summary
The methodology extends the MD3 dataset to create M-MD3, masking target words in dialogues between US English and Indian English speakers playing a word-guessing game. Two evaluative tasks are formulated: target word prediction (predict the masked target word in a conversation) and target word selection (select the most likely masked target word from a set of candidates). The evaluation uses three models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama3) in both pre-trained and fine-tuned configurations, comparing performance across four subsets: en-US, en-IN, en-MV (US English transformed to Indian English), and en-TR (Indian English with dialectal information removed). Performance is measured using accuracy and similarity metrics.

## Key Results
- All models show significant performance gaps between US English (en-US) and Indian English (en-IN), with GPT-4 achieving the highest pre-trained performance and Llama3 showing best results after fine-tuning
- Fine-tuning improves model performance on Indian English conversations, particularly for ambiguous descriptions and public figure references
- Removing dialectal features from Indian English (en-TR) brings performance closer to US English levels, suggesting dialectal bias in pre-trained models
- The evaluation reveals a 12.66 point similarity gap and 17.4 point accuracy gap between US and Indian English across all model configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Masked target word prediction in taboo-like dialogues correlates with conversational understanding. By masking the target word at the end of a dialogue turn, the model must infer the masked word based on the semantic context of prior dialogue turns, forcing it to process contextual cues, dialect-specific phrasing, and cultural references.

### Mechanism 2
Fine-tuning on dialect-specific data improves model performance on marginalized dialects by adapting the model's internal representations to better align with the linguistic features and cultural context of the target dialect, reducing the performance gap observed in pre-trained models.

### Mechanism 3
Removing dialectal features from Indian English conversations (en-TR) brings them closer to the US English distribution that models understand better. By normalizing or removing dialect-specific markers, the resulting conversations become more similar to mainstream US English, which pre-trained models are more familiar with.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Masked language modeling (MLM) and autoregressive generation
  - **Why needed here:** The evaluation tasks rely on the model's ability to predict or select masked target words, which is fundamentally an MLM/autoregressive task
  - **Quick check question:** Can the model generate coherent text when a word is masked, and does it use context effectively to infer the masked word?

- **Concept:** Dialectal variation and its impact on language model performance
  - **Why needed here:** The core research question examines how well models handle different English dialects, requiring understanding of what constitutes dialectal variation
  - **Quick check question:** What linguistic features distinguish US English from Indian English in conversational data, and how do these features affect model predictions?

- **Concept:** Fine-tuning strategies and their impact on model adaptation
  - **Why needed here:** The experiments compare pre-trained and fine-tuned models, requiring knowledge of how fine-tuning modifies model behavior
  - **Quick check question:** How does fine-tuning on dialect-specific data change the model's performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain examples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Conversation data -> Masking preprocessor -> LLM (pre-trained/fine-tuned) -> Prediction/selection output -> Accuracy and similarity metrics
- **Critical path:** Load and preprocess conversation data -> Apply masking to target word position -> Generate predictions using LLM -> Compute similarity and accuracy metrics -> Analyze results across configurations
- **Design tradeoffs:** Masking strategy ensures consistent task structure but may oversimplify dialectal nuances; subset creation enables controlled experiments but may not fully capture natural dialectal variation; closed-source models offer strong performance but limited fine-tuning while open-source allows fine-tuning but may lag in pre-training quality
- **Failure signatures:** High similarity but low accuracy indicates model generates semantically related but incorrect words; poor performance on en-IN vs en-US indicates dialectal bias in pre-training data; no improvement after fine-tuning suggests fine-tuning data is insufficient or misaligned
- **First 3 experiments:** Evaluate pre-trained models on en-US and en-IN for TWP to establish baseline performance gap; fine-tune Llama3 on en-IN and re-evaluate to measure adaptation effect; compare en-TR vs en-IN performance to assess impact of dialectal normalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would fine-tuning on dialect-specific data affect the performance of language models on tasks involving different English dialects beyond the Indian and US English examined in this study? The study focuses on Indian and US English dialects and does not explore effects on other English dialects.

### Open Question 2
What are the specific linguistic features or patterns that contribute to the performance gap between US English and other dialects in language models? The study identifies performance gaps but does not delve into specific linguistic features causing these differences.

### Open Question 3
How do the error patterns identified in the study (e.g., ambiguous descriptions, wrong descriptions) vary across different dialects and language models? The paper provides a general overview of error patterns but does not explore how these patterns may differ across specific dialects or model architectures.

## Limitations
The evaluation relies on synthetic dialect transformation which may not accurately capture natural dialectal variation; the study focuses exclusively on US and Indian English limiting generalizability; Sentence-BERT similarity measurement may not fully capture semantic nuances in dialect-specific contexts.

## Confidence
*High confidence:* The performance gap between US and Indian English across all models is well-established with statistically significant results (p < 0.01). The observation that fine-tuning improves Indian English performance is supported by consistent experimental evidence.

*Medium confidence:* The claim that smaller models perform more equitably after fine-tuning is based on observed trends but lacks statistical power analysis. The effectiveness of dialectal transformation (en-TR) in improving performance is demonstrated but not fully explained mechanistically.

*Low confidence:* The assertion that removing dialectal information from Indian English conversations brings them closer to US English distribution is based on design intent rather than empirical linguistic analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human annotation studies to validate whether synthetic dialect transformations accurately capture dialectal differences while preserving semantic meaning
2. Perform formal statistical testing to determine significance of performance differences between model configurations, particularly for fine-tuning effects
3. Replicate evaluation methodology using different dialect pairs to test framework's applicability beyond US-Indian English comparison
