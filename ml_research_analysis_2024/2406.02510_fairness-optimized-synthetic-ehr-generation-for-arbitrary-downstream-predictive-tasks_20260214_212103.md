# Fairness-Optimized Synthetic EHR Generation for Arbitrary Downstream Predictive Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02510
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02510
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces pipeline for generating fairness-optimized synthetic EHR data that improves fairness metrics when augmenting real data

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel pipeline for generating fairness-optimized synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data that addresses bias in downstream predictive tasks. The method integrates a fairness optimization objective into synthetic data generation, specifically targeting bias reduction across sensitive subgroups such as ethnicity. By augmenting real EHR data with fairness-optimized synthetic data, the approach demonstrates improved fairness metrics including Disparate Impact and worst True Positive Rate for mortality prediction tasks on MIMIC-III and PIC datasets, while maintaining predictive accuracy.

## Method Summary
The pipeline uses a transformer-based synthetic data generator (HALO) enhanced with a fairness loss term that encourages equitable outcomes across sensitive subgroups. The fairness optimization is integrated directly into the synthetic data generation process, creating synthetic EHR records that when combined with real data, produce downstream models with reduced bias. The approach specifically targets improvements in fairness metrics such as Disparate Impact and worst True Positive Rate while attempting to maintain predictive performance for clinical tasks like mortality prediction.

## Key Results
- Fairness-optimized synthetic data augmentation improves Disparate Impact and worst True Positive Rate metrics for mortality prediction tasks
- The approach achieves better fairness without sacrificing accuracy compared to baseline methods
- Trade-offs exist between fairness weights and F1-scores, with higher fairness weights reducing predictive performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by embedding fairness constraints directly into the synthetic data generation process rather than treating it as a post-processing step. By optimizing for fairness during generation, the synthetic data inherently contains more balanced representations across sensitive subgroups, which when combined with real data, helps downstream models learn more equitable patterns. The transformer-based architecture (HALO) enables capturing complex temporal and structural relationships in EHR data while the fairness loss term ensures equitable treatment across demographic groups.

## Foundational Learning
- Transformer-based synthetic data generation (why needed: to capture complex EHR temporal patterns; quick check: evaluate sequence reconstruction accuracy)
- Fairness loss integration in GAN frameworks (why needed: to optimize for equitable outcomes during generation; quick check: monitor DI/WTPR during training)
- Sensitive attribute subgroup analysis (why needed: to measure and mitigate bias across demographic groups; quick check: stratified performance metrics)
- EHR data augmentation strategies (why needed: to enhance dataset diversity without compromising privacy; quick check: compare synthetic vs real data statistics)
- Fairness-accuracy trade-off optimization (why needed: to balance clinical utility with equitable outcomes; quick check: Pareto frontier analysis)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Real EHR Data -> Transformer-based Generator (HALO) -> Fairness Loss Term -> Synthetic Data Output -> Augmented Dataset -> Downstream Predictor

Critical Path:
The critical path involves generating synthetic data with integrated fairness constraints, then using this augmented dataset for training downstream predictive models. The key innovation is the simultaneous optimization of both data generation quality and fairness metrics.

Design Tradeoffs:
The primary tradeoff is between predictive accuracy and fairness optimization - higher fairness weights improve equity metrics but reduce F1-scores. The method must balance these competing objectives based on clinical context requirements.

Failure Signatures:
Potential failures include generating synthetic data that lacks clinical realism, producing fairness improvements that don't generalize to unseen subgroups, or creating augmented datasets that degrade predictive performance for certain populations.

First 3 Experiments:
1. Evaluate synthetic data quality by comparing statistical properties against real EHR data
2. Test fairness improvements across multiple sensitive attributes beyond ethnicity
3. Assess performance on multi-class classification tasks and time-to-event predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused primarily on binary mortality prediction tasks, limiting generalizability to complex clinical scenarios
- Performance on other sensitive attributes beyond ethnicity was not explicitly evaluated
- Reliance on specific datasets (MIMIC-III and PIC) may limit external validity for populations not well-represented in these sources

## Confidence

High confidence: The synthetic data generation pipeline's technical implementation and basic fairness improvements are well-established

Medium confidence: Claims about practical utility and deployment readiness, given limited real-world validation

Medium confidence: The generalizability of results across different clinical tasks and sensitive attributes

## Next Checks

1. Test the pipeline on diverse clinical prediction tasks beyond mortality, including multi-class classification and time-to-event predictions

2. Evaluate performance across multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously (ethnicity, age, gender) to assess intersectional fairness

3. Conduct external validation using EHR data from different healthcare systems and populations not represented in MIMIC-III or PIC datasets
