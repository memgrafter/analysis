# ASGM-KG: Unveiling Alluvial Gold Mining Through Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08972
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08972
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: ASGM-KG consolidates ASGM information from 9 documents into 1,899 triples with 90%+ validation accuracy via unsupervised DAS framework.

## Executive Summary
ASGM-KG is a knowledge graph consolidating information on artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) from diverse sources to support understanding of its environmental effects. The graph contains 1,899 triples extracted using a large language model from 9 expert-selected documents. An unsupervised framework (DAS) was developed to validate triples by searching web content and using majority voting, achieving over 90% accuracy compared to domain expert validation. The graph is publicly available with three downstream tasks: query answering, subgraph summarization, and natural language chat. This work advances knowledge aggregation for interdisciplinary environmental crises by combining automated extraction, validation, and expert curation.

## Method Summary
The method combines LLM-based RDF extraction with unsupervised factual validation. Documents are processed using GPT-4 to extract triples following a specified ontology schema, yielding 1,899 triples from 9 ASGM-related documents. The DAS framework validates these triples by retrieving relevant web pages via DuckDuckGo, ranking them by relevance, summarizing content with GPT-4, and applying majority voting to determine factual correctness. Expert validation on a subset confirms DAS achieves over 90% accuracy.

## Key Results
- 1,899 RDF triples extracted from 9 expert-selected ASGM documents
- DAS framework achieves >90% accuracy vs expert validation
- Three downstream tasks enabled: query answering, subgraph summarization, and natural language chat

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DAS achieves high accuracy by leveraging majority voting over top-ranked web pages retrieved via search engine queries.
- Mechanism: For each RDF triple, DAS uses a search engine to find web pages containing the triple's subject-predicate-object terms, ranks pages by relevance, summarizes the top K pages with an LLM, and applies majority voting on the factual correctness labels to determine the final verdict.
- Core assumption: The majority of top-ranked web pages contain accurate, up-to-date information about the subject matter, and LLM-based summarization can reliably infer factual correctness from that content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Second, we devised and applied an automated factual reduction framework that relies on a search engine and an LLM for labeling triples."
  - [section] "The third step uses an LLM model to summarize the content of each web page and infer whether the RDF statement is factually correct based on the K top ranked web pages. The last step uses majority voting to determine whether the RDF is factual or not."
- Break condition: If search results are dominated by misinformation or outdated content, or if the LLM summarization fails to capture nuanced factual context, the majority voting outcome will be unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-based RDF extraction yields high coverage of domain-specific knowledge by leveraging contextual understanding of natural language text.
- Mechanism: A tuned prompt instructs the LLM to identify entities (nouns) and relations (verbs) from each sentence, respecting ontology constraints, then construct subject-predicate-object triples accordingly.
- Core assumption: The LLM's contextual understanding and semantic reasoning capabilities are sufficient to correctly parse complex sentences and extract valid knowledge triples without extensive manual rule engineering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The current version of ASGM-KG consists of 1,899 triples extracted using a large language model (LLM) from documents and reports published by both non-governmental and governmental organizations."
  - [section] "We extract RDF statements in entity-relation-entity format by querying an LLM using a specified ontology schema... The application of this prompt tuning process resulted in 2,653 RDF triples."
- Break condition: If the source text is ambiguous, contains domain-specific jargon the LLM cannot resolve, or if the prompt schema is too restrictive, the extraction process will miss valid triples or introduce errors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Validation against expert-labeled triples demonstrates DAS is a practical substitute for full manual review when scaling knowledge graph construction.
- Mechanism: Domain experts manually validate a subset of DAS-labeled triples; high agreement (90%) between DAS and expert judgments justifies trusting DAS output for the remainder of the graph.
- Core assumption: The small manually validated sample is representative of the full triple set, and the expert validation process itself is sufficiently accurate and unbiased.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This knowledge graph was validated using two methods. First, a small team of ASGM experts reviewed and labeled triples as factual or non-factual."
  - [section] "A comparison of DAS versus domain experts on this 579 triples yields 90% matching accuracy."
- Break condition: If the expert validation introduces systematic bias or if the sample size is too small to represent the diversity of triple types, the claimed accuracy will not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: RDF triple structure (subject-predicate-object)
  - Why needed here: All downstream tasks and validation rely on consistent triple representation.
  - Quick check question: Given the sentence "Mercury contaminates water in ASGM sites," what would the corresponding RDF triple be?

- Concept: Knowledge graph completion and validation
  - Why needed here: Ensures extracted triples are factually correct before they are used in downstream applications.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a positive and a hard negative sample in a knowledge graph validation dataset?

- Concept: Majority voting in unsupervised classification
  - Why needed here: DAS uses majority voting to aggregate evidence from multiple web pages for factual verification.
  - Quick check question: If 4 out of 5 retrieved web pages say a triple is factual and 1 says it is not, what is the final label assigned by DAS?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM extractor -> RDF storage (RDF format) -> DAS validator (search engine + LLM + ranking + majority voting) -> Expert validation (subset) -> ASGM-KG portal (query answering, summarization, chat)
- Critical path: Document ingestion -> LLM extraction -> Triple storage -> DAS validation -> Portal deployment
- Design tradeoffs: LLM-based extraction trades precision for broad coverage; DAS trades computational cost and dependency on web content for reduced expert labor.
- Failure signatures: Low extraction yield (LLM prompt issues), poor DAS accuracy (search ranking failure or misinformation in results), portal performance bottlenecks (large triple set queries).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run LLM extraction on a small sample document and manually verify triple quality.
  2. Execute DAS on a small triple set and compare results to expert labels.
  3. Load extracted triples into the portal and test each downstream task (query, summarization, chat) on a small graph.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the DAS framework be further optimized to reduce false positives in classifying triples as factual or non-factual?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The DAS framework shows comparable performance to benchmark methods, but there is room for improvement in reducing misclassifications, as evidenced by the manual checking of misclassified triples.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific types of errors made by the DAS framework or propose methods for optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive error analysis of the DAS framework's classifications, followed by the implementation and testing of optimization techniques, such as fine-tuning the LLM model or adjusting the search engine parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the ASGM-KG be expanded to include additional data sources and languages to improve its coverage and utility for global stakeholders?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential for expanding ASGM-KG with additional documents curated by domain experts worldwide and the inclusion of data sources in languages other than English and Spanish.
- Why unresolved: The current version of ASGM-KG is limited to 9 documents and primarily in English and Spanish, which may not fully capture the global scope of ASGM.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic approach to identifying and incorporating additional data sources from diverse regions and languages, followed by an evaluation of the expanded KG's performance and utility for stakeholders in different countries.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can neuro-symbolic methods be effectively integrated with ASGM-KG to improve interpretability, explainability, and contextual awareness for forecasting future ASGM activities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that neuro-symbolic methods can be explored to integrate complex and uncertain data for improved interpretability, explainability, and contextual awareness in forecasting ASGM activities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples or case studies of how neuro-symbolic methods can be applied to ASGM-KG or the challenges associated with their integration.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and implementation of neuro-symbolic models that leverage ASGM-KG's knowledge and other relevant data sources, followed by an evaluation of their performance in forecasting ASGM activities compared to existing methods.

## Limitations

- The reproducibility of the LLM-based RDF extraction is uncertain without the exact ontology schema and prompt structure used, which could affect the quality and quantity of extracted triples.
- The DAS framework's performance is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of search engine results, which can vary significantly based on current web content and search algorithms.
- The claim of 90% accuracy compared to expert validation is based on a subset of 579 triples, which may not be representative of the full triple set.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall approach of using LLM for extraction and DAS for validation is sound and aligns with current best practices in knowledge graph construction.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported accuracy of DAS compared to expert validation, while promising, is based on a limited sample and may not fully represent the entire triple set.
- **Low Confidence**: The exact implementation details of the LLM prompt and DAS parameters are not fully specified, which could significantly impact the reproducibility and performance of the system.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce LLM Extraction**: Implement the RDF extraction using the provided ontology schema on a small sample of ASGM documents and manually verify the quality and quantity of extracted triples.
2. **Validate DAS Accuracy**: Apply the DAS framework to a subset of triples and compare the results to expert labels to assess the accuracy and reliability of the unsupervised validation method.
3. **Test Downstream Tasks**: Load the extracted triples into the ASGM-KG portal and test each downstream task (query answering, subgraph summarization, and natural language chat) on a small graph to ensure functionality and performance.
