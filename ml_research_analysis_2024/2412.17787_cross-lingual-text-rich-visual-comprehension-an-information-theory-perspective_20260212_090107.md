# Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Comprehension: An Information Theory Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17787
- Reference count: 13
- LVLMs show up to 40.4% performance drop in cross-lingual text-rich visual comprehension

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the significant performance gap in large vision-language models (LVLMs) when handling cross-lingual text-rich visual comprehension tasks, where questions are in a different language than the text within images. The authors introduce XT-VQA, a comprehensive benchmark combining five existing datasets with a newly collected XPaperQA dataset of academic papers, to evaluate LVLMs under cross-lingual scenarios. Through mutual information analysis, they demonstrate that cross-lingual questions fail to adequately activate relevant visual information, leading to substantial accuracy drops even for multilingual models. To address this, they propose MVCL-MI, a knowledge distillation method that maximizes vision-language cross-lingual mutual information, effectively reducing the performance disparity while preserving monolingual capabilities.

## Method Summary
The approach combines benchmark construction with a novel training method. XT-VQA integrates five existing datasets with XPaperQA (4,436 QA pairs from academic papers) to create a comprehensive evaluation framework. The MVCL-MI method addresses cross-lingual gaps by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a teacher to guide cross-lingual predictions. The training objective combines cross-entropy loss for maximizing answer likelihood with KL divergence terms to align cross-lingual distributions with monolingual ones, ensuring visual-language alignment across languages.

## Key Results
- LVLMs show 32.6% average performance drop in cross-lingual settings
- MVCL-MI achieves up to 16.3% improvement in cross-lingual accuracy
- Performance gap varies by question type: abstractive (31.4%) > extractive (31.0%) > yes-no (22.0%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-lingual performance gaps stem from insufficient mutual information between visual tokens and output distributions when processing cross-lingual questions.
- Mechanism: When questions are in different languages than image text, attention to visual content weakens, reducing correlation between visual tokens and output predictions.
- Core assumption: Visual information is critical for answering text-rich visual questions, and LVLM's ability to activate relevant visual features depends on language alignment.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "A mutual information analysis suggests that this performance gap stems from cross-lingual questions failing to adequately activate relevant visual information" and [section] "Experimental results on XT-VQA reveal that while LVLMs demonstrate multilingual capabilities, they face significant difficulties in cross-lingual text-rich visual comprehension, with performance dropping by 32.6%."
- Break condition: If visual information is not required for correct answers (e.g., questions can be answered from language priors alone), mutual information analysis would not predict performance gaps.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MVCL-MI improves cross-lingual performance by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization.
- Mechanism: The method uses monolingual output logits as a teacher to guide cross-lingual predictions, ensuring cross-lingual distributions stay close to monolingual distributions.
- Core assumption: Monolingual predictions contain reliable visual-language correlations that can transfer to cross-lingual settings when properly aligned through distillation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This is achieved by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a teacher" and [section] "To mitigate this, we propose MVCL-MI (Maximize Vision-Language Cross-Lingual Mutual Information), a method designed to enhance the activation of visual information in LVLMs."
- Break condition: If monolingual predictions contain language-specific biases that don't transfer well to other languages, the distillation could reinforce incorrect patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-lingual performance gaps vary by question type, with abstractive and extractive questions showing larger drops than yes-no questions.
- Mechanism: Different question types require different levels of visual comprehension. Abstractive and extractive questions demand deeper understanding of visual content, making them more sensitive to language misalignment.
- Core assumption: Question type correlates with required visual comprehension depth, and this depth determines sensitivity to cross-lingual interference.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Cross-lingual gap varies in different types of questions. In English paper, the decrease on the 3 types of questions is 31.4% in abstractive, 31.0% in extractive, and 22.0% in yes-no" and [section] "In Chinese paper, the average decrease in the 3 types of questions is 44.2% in extractive, 39.8% in abstractive, and 11.1% in yes-no, exhibit Gapext > Gap abs > Gap yesno."
- Break condition: If question difficulty rather than type drives performance differences, the observed pattern might not reflect visual comprehension requirements.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mutual Information
  - Why needed here: The paper uses mutual information to quantify how well visual tokens activate relevant information for different languages, explaining performance gaps.
  - Quick check question: If you have two random variables X and Y, what does I(X;Y) measure in terms of their relationship?

- Concept: KL Divergence
  - Why needed here: KL divergence is used in the MVCL-MI method to align cross-lingual predictions with monolingual predictions through knowledge distillation.
  - Quick check question: What does KL(P||Q) measure, and why is it asymmetric (KL(P||Q) ≠ KL(Q||P))?

- Concept: Cross-Entropy Loss
  - Why needed here: Cross-entropy loss is used in the training objectives to maximize the likelihood of correct answers in both source and target languages.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-entropy loss relate to maximum likelihood estimation in classification tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Vision Encoder → Projector → Visual Tokens + Question → LLM → Output Distribution
- Critical path: Visual tokens are created by encoding images and projecting them to text embedding space, then used as input to the LLM with language instructions. Mutual information analysis measures correlation between visual tokens and output distributions under different language conditions.
- Design tradeoffs: The MVCL-MI method trades additional training complexity (knowledge distillation across languages) for improved cross-lingual performance while preserving monolingual capabilities.
- Failure signatures: If cross-lingual performance doesn't improve despite KL divergence training, it may indicate that monolingual predictions don't contain transferable visual-language correlations. If monolingual performance degrades, the distillation might be over-regularizing.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Measure mutual information I(Y;V|Q) for monolingual vs cross-lingual questions on a small dataset to confirm the correlation with accuracy.
  2. Implement KL divergence distillation from monolingual to cross-lingual settings on a single dataset type to verify the training approach.
  3. Compare performance on different question types (yes-no vs extractive vs abstractive) in cross-lingual settings to validate the question-type sensitivity hypothesis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical foundations for why visual tokens should correlate with output distributions across languages are not rigorously established
- The MVCL-MI method's generalizability to languages beyond Chinese remains uncertain
- The XPaperQA dataset construction involves automated extraction that may introduce quality control issues

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical observation of cross-lingual performance gaps (32.6% average decrease) is well-supported by experimental results across multiple LVLMs and datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: The mutual information analysis provides a plausible mechanism for performance gaps, but the causal relationship between I(Y;V|Q) and accuracy is inferred rather than directly proven.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of MVCL-MI to languages beyond Chinese and the long-term effectiveness of KL divergence distillation for maintaining cross-lingual visual-language alignment remain uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study where visual tokens are randomly shuffled or corrupted to measure how I(Y;V|Q) changes affect accuracy independently of language conditions.
2. Evaluate MVCL-MI on diverse language pairs including non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Thai, Hindi) and low-resource languages to determine whether the knowledge distillation approach generalizes beyond Chinese-English settings.
3. Perform human evaluation of XPaperQA samples to verify that generated questions accurately reflect document content and that answers require genuine visual comprehension rather than language inference alone.
