# Lost in Recursion: Mining Rich Event Semantics in Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.16405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16405
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces recursive narrative construction and binding to ECKGs for mining viewpoint-specific narratives

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to mining and representing narratives from multiple viewpoints on complex real-world events. The authors formalize narratives using recursive nodes to represent different levels of detail and bind them to event-centric knowledge graphs (ECKGs). An algorithm based on incremental prompting techniques mines such narratives from text sources to account for different perspectives. A proof-of-concept case study on the Iraq War demonstrates the approach, mining 105 event labels across three viewpoints (Russia, UK, US) and successfully binding 50 events to Wikidata.

## Method Summary
The approach combines recursive narrative representation with event-centric knowledge graphs to capture multiple viewpoints on complex events. The method uses a large language model with incremental prompting to mine narratives from document collections, employing pairwise matching and synthesis to create viewpoint-specific event sequences. The recursive structure allows for hierarchical representation of events, while binding to ECKGs provides disambiguation and contextualization of event labels.

## Key Results
- Successfully mined 105 event labels across three viewpoints (Russia, UK, US) on the Iraq War
- Bound 50 events to Wikidata, demonstrating effective narrative-ECKG integration
- Captured viewpoint-specific narratives with distinct event selections and temporal orderings
- Demonstrated the ability to handle compound event labels and indirect binding cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Recursive narrative construction enables hierarchical representation of complex events by allowing event labels to point to sub-narratives
- Mechanism: The narrative definition introduces a function 𝜂 (𝑒, 𝑛) that maps each event label to another narrative, creating a recursive structure. This allows complex events to be decomposed into sub-events while maintaining the overall narrative flow.
- Core assumption: Human language and understanding of complex events is inherently recursive, allowing for multiple levels of granularity in event representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We provide a formal representation of narratives based on recursive nodes to represent multiple levels of detail"
  - [section]: "At the core, we understand a narrative as a sequence of events arranged by a narrator to describe properties and inner workings of complex events... The core idea is that since human language is constructed recursively, narratives can also be seen as the result of compositions of different narratives"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on hierarchical event schemas but doesn't directly support the recursive narrative claim
- Break condition: If 𝜂 (𝑒, 𝑛) = ∅ for all events in all narratives, recursion terminates, preventing infinite loops.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Binding narratives to event-centric knowledge graphs (ECKGs) provides disambiguation and contextualization of event labels.
- Mechanism: The binding function 𝜇 (𝑒, 𝑛) maps event labels in narratives to corresponding events or subgraphs in ECKGs. This allows for canonical representation of named events and inclusion of additional metadata.
- Core assumption: Event labels in narratives can be mapped to existing events in ECKGs or can be treated as virtual events with inferred properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "discuss how narratives can be bound to event-centric knowledge graphs"
  - [section]: "The binding 𝜇 maps the event label to its equivalent event in an ECKG... That is, it returns the subgraph consisting of all triples with the identifier Q112127201 in the subject"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on event linking but doesn't directly support the narrative-ECKG binding claim
- Break condition: If no corresponding event exists in the ECKG, the node is treated as virtual and substituted with a pointer to a subgraph combining known information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incremental prompting techniques can mine narratives from text sources while accounting for different perspectives.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses a series of prompts to extract event timelines from documents, match events across documents using similarity measures, and synthesize them into narrative relationships. This process is repeated recursively for sub-events.
- Core assumption: Large language models can accurately extract events, their temporal relationships, and generate concise descriptions from text documents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we provide an algorithm based on incremental prompting techniques that mines such narratives from texts to account for different perspectives on complex events"
  - [section]: "We introduce an algorithm based on incremental prompting approach... The basic idea is to integrate the narrator in this setting... This step is performed recursively to generate narratives"
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - corpus shows related work on hierarchical event schema induction using prompting techniques
- Break condition: If 𝜂 (𝑒𝑣, 𝑛) = ∅ for all events in all narratives, the recursion stops.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding ECKGs is crucial as they serve as the structured knowledge repository to which narratives are bound
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes an ECKG from a general-purpose knowledge graph?

- Concept: Recursive Structures in Narratives
  - Why needed here: The core innovation relies on recursive narrative representation, allowing for multiple levels of event granularity
  - Quick check question: How does the 𝜂 function enable recursive narrative construction?

- Concept: Viewpoints and Attribution
  - Why needed here: Viewpoints represent different perspectives on events, which is essential for understanding how narratives can differ while concerning the same event
  - Quick check question: How do viewpoints aggregate individual stances into consensual stances?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Event, viewpoint, document collection -> Processing: Event detection, timeline extraction, pairwise matching, synthesis, recursion -> Output: Narrative with recursive structure and bindings to ECKG

- Critical path: Document selection → Event detection → Timeline extraction → Pairwise matching → Synthesis → Recursion (until 𝜂 (𝑒𝑣, 𝑛) = ∅)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using open-domain web data provides rich, diverse narratives but introduces noise and requires careful event disambiguation
  - Recursive narrative structure enables detailed representation but increases complexity in event binding and mining
  - LLM-based mining is flexible and domain-independent but may struggle with precise temporal relationships and event extraction

- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete or incorrect event timelines due to poor document selection or LLM hallucinations
  - Failure to bind events to ECKG due to ambiguous event labels or lack of corresponding ECKG entries
  - Infinite recursion or excessive depth due to improper termination conditions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test event extraction accuracy on a small, controlled document set with known events
  2. Evaluate event binding success rate on a sample of extracted events with a small ECKG
  3. Assess narrative quality and viewpoint differences on a limited set of viewpoints and documents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed algorithm for mining narratives from text sources be improved to better handle the extraction of accurate event timestamps and narrative relationships?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies challenges in extracting accurate event timestamps and narrative relationships, which are crucial for the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm but also highlights these specific challenges, indicating that improvements are needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing improved accuracy in event timestamp and narrative relationship extraction using enhanced versions of the algorithm.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific challenges and potential solutions for implementing effective event linking between narratives and Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of binding events in narratives to ECKGs and mentions the challenges involved in this process.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a theoretical framework for binding events, it does not delve into the practical challenges and solutions for implementing this in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experiments demonstrating successful event linking between narratives and ECKGs, along with identified challenges and proposed solutions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the narrative model be extended to handle more complex and diverse real-world events, beyond the proof-of-concept case study on the Iraq War?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a proof-of-concept case study, suggesting that further research is needed to apply the model to a wider range of events.
- Why unresolved: The case study is limited in scope and does not explore the model's applicability to other complex events or different domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the narrative model to various real-world events, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across different contexts.

## Limitations

- The recursive narrative representation introduces significant computational and semantic complexity that may limit scalability to very large events
- The binding mechanism to ECKGs is conceptually sound but empirically validated only partially (50/105 events successfully bound)
- The proof-of-concept case study focuses on a single event across three viewpoints, limiting generalizability to other complex events or larger numbers of perspectives

## Confidence

- High confidence: The formal definitions of narratives, viewpoints, and binding mechanisms (𝜂 and 𝜇 functions) are clearly specified and internally consistent. The overall architecture and methodology description are coherent and implementable.
- Medium confidence: The incremental prompting algorithm and its recursive nature are well-described, but the effectiveness depends heavily on prompt engineering quality which isn't fully specified. The pairwise matching approach using SBERT and HDBSCAN is standard but may struggle with semantic similarity in event descriptions.
- Low confidence: The claims about viewpoint-specific narrative capture are based on qualitative observations rather than quantitative analysis. The paper doesn't provide systematic evaluation of narrative quality, viewpoint differences, or comparison with baseline methods.

## Next Checks

1. **Event extraction accuracy validation**: Implement a controlled experiment with a small document set containing known events to measure the LLM's accuracy in extracting events, timestamps, and relationships. Compare results against a gold standard to quantify precision and recall.

2. **Binding mechanism stress test**: Create a systematic evaluation of the binding process by generating synthetic event labels with varying levels of ambiguity and testing the matching algorithm's ability to correctly bind to Wikidata entities. Analyze failure patterns and develop improved matching strategies.

3. **Cross-viewpoint narrative comparison**: Implement a quantitative analysis framework to measure viewpoint differences across the three narratives. Use semantic similarity metrics and topic modeling to identify statistically significant differences in event selection, temporal ordering, and narrative framing.
