# An image speaks a thousand words, but can everyone listen? On image transcreation for cultural relevance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.01247
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01247
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Machine learning models fail to achieve cultural relevance in image transcreation, with best pipelines only successfully transcreating 5% of images for some countries in concept dataset and none for some countries in application dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the task of image transcreation—adapting visual content to different cultural contexts—using machine learning. The authors build three distinct pipelines using state-of-the-art generative models to address this challenge: instruction-based editing, caption editing with LLM plus image editing, and caption editing with LLM plus image retrieval. A comprehensive two-part evaluation dataset is constructed, including a "concept" set of 600 culturally salient images across 7 countries and a real-world "application" set of 100 images from education and children's literature. Human evaluation across 7 countries reveals that current image-editing models fail to achieve cultural relevance, with success rates as low as 5% for some countries and 0% for others. The results demonstrate the challenging nature of the task and highlight the need for improved cultural understanding in generative models.

## Method Summary
The authors develop three distinct pipelines for image transcreation using state-of-the-art generative models. The first pipeline uses end-to-end instruction-based editing, where models directly receive cultural adaptation instructions. The second pipeline employs caption editing with a large language model (LLM) followed by image editing, separating the cultural understanding and visual generation tasks. The third pipeline also uses LLM-based caption editing but pairs it with image retrieval instead of generation, seeking culturally appropriate images from existing databases. To evaluate these approaches, the authors construct a two-part dataset: a "concept" set containing 600 culturally salient images spanning 7 different countries, and an "application" set of 100 real-world images from educational materials and children's literature. Human evaluators from 7 countries assess the cultural relevance of the transcreatied images across all pipelines and datasets.

## Key Results
- Image-editing models fail to achieve cultural relevance, with success rates as low as 5% for some countries in the concept dataset
- Best-performing pipeline (caption editing with LLM + image retrieval) achieved 0% success rate for some countries in the application dataset
- Human evaluation across 7 countries consistently shows poor performance of all three transcreation pipelines
- The task proves challenging even for state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting fundamental limitations in current cultural understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that current generative models lack the sophisticated cultural understanding required for effective image transcreation. While these models can generate visually coherent images and perform basic caption editing, they struggle to incorporate nuanced cultural context, symbolism, and local preferences. The separation of tasks in the second and third pipelines (caption editing vs. image generation/retrieval) does not overcome this fundamental limitation, suggesting that the challenge lies in the models' understanding of cultural relevance rather than the technical implementation. The consistently poor performance across all three approaches indicates that achieving cultural relevance requires more than just technical improvements—it demands deeper cultural intelligence that current models have not acquired.

## Foundational Learning

**Cultural salience:** The ability to recognize and represent culturally significant elements, symbols, and contexts that resonate with specific populations. *Why needed:* Essential for determining which visual elements require adaptation and what constitutes appropriate cultural representation. *Quick check:* Can the model identify culturally specific objects, colors, gestures, or settings that differ across regions?

**Cross-cultural visual semantics:** Understanding how visual meaning varies across cultures, including different interpretations of symbols, colors, and imagery. *Why needed:* Critical for ensuring that transcreatied images maintain intended meaning while adapting to cultural contexts. *Quick check:* Does the model recognize that certain symbols or visual elements carry different meanings across cultures?

**Cultural context integration:** The ability to incorporate multiple layers of cultural context simultaneously, including historical, social, and contemporary factors. *Why needed:* Real-world cultural relevance requires understanding beyond surface-level attributes to include deeper cultural meanings and associations. *Quick check:* Can the model adapt images while preserving the underlying message and emotional resonance across cultural boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** LLM-based caption analysis -> Cultural relevance assessment -> Image generation or retrieval -> Human evaluation
The critical path flows from caption analysis through cultural assessment to final image output, with human evaluation providing feedback on success.

**Critical path:** Caption analysis (LLM) -> Cultural adaptation decisions -> Image generation/retrieval -> Human evaluation
This sequence represents the core workflow where cultural understanding must be successfully integrated to produce culturally relevant outputs.

**Design tradeoffs:** The study balances between end-to-end generation (potentially more coherent but less controllable) versus modular approaches (more interpretable but requiring successful integration). The choice to use existing state-of-the-art models rather than fine-tuning on cultural datasets prioritizes generalizability but may limit cultural specificity.

**Failure signatures:** Consistent failure across all countries and pipelines indicates fundamental limitations in cultural understanding rather than implementation-specific issues. Zero success rates for certain countries suggest the absence of relevant cultural knowledge in training data or model architectures.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test inter-rater reliability by having multiple evaluators from the same country assess identical images
2. Evaluate whether providing explicit cultural context examples in prompts improves transcreation success
3. Compare performance when models are given additional cultural metadata alongside visual input

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation introduces potential subjectivity and cultural bias within the evaluation process itself
- No inter-rater reliability metrics provided to validate consistency of cultural expertise across evaluators
- Only three specific pipelines evaluated, leaving open whether alternative approaches might perform better
- Results may reflect implementation choices rather than fundamental limitations of the task

## Confidence
**High confidence:**
- Image-editing models fundamentally fail at achieving cultural relevance (consistently low success rates across multiple countries and pipelines)
- Task requires improved cultural understanding in generative models (clear gap between current capabilities and requirements)

**Medium confidence:**
- Inherent difficulty of the task (poor performance may reflect specific implementation choices rather than fundamental limitations)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis on the human evaluation data to quantify agreement between evaluators from different cultural backgrounds
2. Test alternative image editing approaches, including fine-tuning diffusion models on culturally diverse datasets, to determine if poor performance is implementation-specific
3. Evaluate whether providing explicit cultural context in prompts improves model performance on the transcreation task
