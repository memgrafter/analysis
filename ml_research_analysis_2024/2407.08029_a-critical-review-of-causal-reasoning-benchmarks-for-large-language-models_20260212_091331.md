# A Critical Review of Causal Reasoning Benchmarks for Large Language Models

- This paper provides a critical review of existing benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically reviews 39 existing benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning in Large Language Models, identifying critical limitations in current evaluation approaches. The authors analyze benchmarks through the lens of causal hierarchies (Zhang et al. 2023 and Pearl and Mackenzie 2018), finding that most focus on associative reasoning rather than true causal understanding. They propose four key criteria for effective causal reasoning benchmarks: use of causal rather than correlative language, open-ended format, scalability with multiple factors, and non-retrievable context. The review highlights recent benchmarks like CLadder that better address these criteria while establishing a framework (CLUE) for future assessment of causal understanding in LLMs.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review, surveying existing review papers (Zecevic et al. 2023, Srivastava et al. 2022) and exploring repositories hosting causal reasoning datasets to collect 39 benchmark datasets and tasks. Each benchmark was categorized according to causal hierarchy frameworks and evaluated against four proposed criteria: causal language, open-endedness, scalability, and non-retrievability. The analysis involved subjective assessment of whether benchmarks met these criteria and identification of common limitations across the collected benchmarks, with particular attention to multiple-choice formats and potential knowledge retrieval issues.

## Key Results
- Current benchmarks predominantly test knowledge retrieval rather than true causal reasoning capabilities
- Multiple-choice formats and single-factor scenarios limit the ability to assess genuine causal understanding
- Recent benchmarks like CLadder better address the four proposed criteria but gaps remain in counterfactual reasoning evaluation
- Most benchmarks focus on associative reasoning (Type 1/Rung 1) rather than interventional or counterfactual reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The review works by systematically applying causal hierarchy frameworks to existing benchmarks, revealing that most current evaluations fail to test true causal reasoning. By establishing four concrete criteria for effective causal reasoning benchmarks, the authors create a framework for distinguishing between mere pattern recognition and genuine causal understanding. The analysis of knowledge retrieval versus causal reasoning provides insight into why LLMs often perform well on benchmarks without demonstrating actual causal comprehension.

## Foundational Learning

**Causal Hierarchies (Zhang et al. 2023)**
- Why needed: Provides framework for categorizing causal reasoning tasks by complexity
- Quick check: Can identify whether a benchmark tests association, intervention, or counterfactual reasoning

**Pearl's Causal Ladder (Pearl and Mackenzie 2018)**
- Why needed: Classic framework for understanding levels of causal reasoning capability
- Quick check: Understands the progression from correlation to intervention to counterfactuals

**Knowledge Retrieval vs Causal Reasoning**
- Why needed: Critical distinction for evaluating whether LLM performance reflects true understanding
- Quick check: Can determine if a benchmark allows memorization versus reasoning

**Counterfactual Reasoning**
- Why needed: Highest level of causal reasoning that most benchmarks fail to test
- Quick check: Can identify whether a benchmark requires reasoning about "what if" scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Benchmarks -> Causal Hierarchy Classification -> Four Criteria Evaluation -> Limitation Analysis -> Framework Proposal

**Critical Path:**
Literature Review → Benchmark Collection (39 datasets) → Causal Hierarchy Classification → Four Criteria Assessment → Gap Analysis → CLUE Framework Proposal

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The review prioritizes comprehensive coverage of existing benchmarks over deep analysis of individual tasks, trading detailed evaluation for breadth of scope. This approach reveals systematic patterns but may miss nuanced strengths of specific benchmarks.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-reliance on multiple-choice formats leading to pattern matching rather than reasoning
- Benchmarks that can be solved through knowledge retrieval rather than causal inference
- Tasks limited to single factors preventing assessment of complex causal reasoning

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Apply the four criteria to a subset of 5-10 benchmarks to establish inter-rater reliability
2. Design a simple counterfactual reasoning task to test against existing benchmarks
3. Evaluate a small language model on both traditional and newly proposed benchmark formats

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the review

## Limitations
- Subjective evaluation criteria for determining whether benchmarks allow knowledge retrieval versus true causal reasoning
- Lack of objective metrics for assessing the four proposed criteria
- Focus primarily on English-language benchmarks, potentially missing diverse causal reasoning tasks across languages and domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Classification of benchmarks according to established causal hierarchies
- Identification of common limitations in current benchmarks (multiple-choice format, over-reliance on knowledge retrieval)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Proposed four criteria for effective causal reasoning benchmarks
- Comprehensive coverage of 39 benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic replication study applying the four criteria to a subset of benchmarks to establish inter-rater reliability and refine the evaluation framework

2. Design and implement a new benchmark task that specifically tests counterfactual reasoning capabilities in a non-retrievable context, addressing the identified gaps

3. Perform an empirical evaluation comparing LLM performance on benchmarks that meet the proposed criteria versus those that don't, to validate the effectiveness of the criteria in measuring true causal understanding
