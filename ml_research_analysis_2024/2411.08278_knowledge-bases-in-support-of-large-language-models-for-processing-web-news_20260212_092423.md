# Knowledge Bases in Support of Large Language Models for Processing Web News

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.08278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08278
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: BERTGraph framework enhances LLM performance for Web news processing by incorporating structured knowledge bases, achieving up to 6% higher accuracy in news category classification compared to baseline BERT model

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BERTGraph, a framework that enhances large language model performance for processing Web news by incorporating structured knowledge bases. The key innovation is using a rule-based News Information Extractor (NewsIE) to automatically extract relational tuples from news items, which are then graph-convoluted with the LLM's implicit knowledge via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This approach avoids expensive LLM retraining by preserving the original BERT embedding. Experimental results on three public datasets (Snopes, N24News, Politifact) demonstrate that BERTGraph outperforms the baseline BERT model, particularly with limited training data.

## Method Summary
The BERTGraph framework processes Web news by first extracting relational tuples from news articles using a rule-based NewsIE module, creating structured knowledge bases. These extracted tuples (subject, predicate, object, complement, adverbial chunks) are then combined with BERT embeddings through a text-to-graph adapter that converts both sources into GCN-compatible input format. The GCN layers perform graph convolution operations that integrate the structured knowledge with the LLM's implicit knowledge, producing enhanced representations for news category classification. The model is fine-tuned on varying percentages (10-80%) of training data across three public datasets.

## Key Results
- BERTGraph achieved up to 6% higher accuracy compared to baseline BERT model on news category classification tasks
- Performance improvements were most pronounced with limited training data (10-40% of dataset)
- The framework demonstrated better robustness against overfitting compared to standard BERT fine-tuning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BERTGraph works by addressing the limitation of LLMs that rely solely on unstructured text representation. By extracting structured relational information from news articles and incorporating it through graph convolution, the framework provides complementary context that helps the model better understand relationships between entities and concepts in news content. The GCN acts as a bridge that preserves BERT's learned representations while adding structured knowledge without requiring full model retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**: Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes - needed for integrating structured knowledge with LLM outputs; quick check: verify GCN can process heterogeneous node types
- **BERT embeddings**: Pre-trained contextual word representations from BERT model - needed as baseline knowledge representation; quick check: ensure embeddings capture news-specific semantics
- **Relational tuple extraction**: Process of identifying subject-predicate-object relationships in text - needed to create structured knowledge bases; quick check: validate extraction accuracy across different news domains
- **Text-to-graph conversion**: Method for transforming textual information into graph-compatible format - needed to bridge unstructured and structured representations; quick check: confirm conversion preserves semantic relationships
- **News Information Extractor (NewsIE)**: Rule-based system for automatic extraction of structured information from news articles - needed to generate knowledge bases without manual annotation; quick check: test extraction robustness across different writing styles

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: News articles -> NewsIE -> Relational tuples -> Text-to-graph adapter -> GCN layers -> Combined with BERT outputs -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The essential processing flow involves: (1) extracting relational tuples from news content using NewsIE, (2) converting both tuples and BERT embeddings into graph format via text-to-graph adapter, (3) performing GCN convolution to integrate structured and unstructured knowledge, and (4) using the enhanced representations for classification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades off the complexity of implementing rule-based extraction and graph convolution against the benefit of avoiding expensive LLM retraining. The use of GCN preserves BERT's original embedding while adding structural information, but requires careful design of the text-to-graph conversion process.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when training size increases may indicate overemphasis on input noise rather than structural patterns. Overfitting on small datasets without structural knowledge integration suggests the need for regularization through knowledge base incorporation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement NewsIE module and test extraction accuracy on sample news articles from different domains
2. Verify text-to-graph adapter correctly converts both BERT embeddings and relational tuples into compatible GCN input format
3. Conduct ablation study comparing BERTGraph with and without GCN layers on small training subsets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's performance on datasets beyond the three tested (Snopes, N24News, Politifact) remains unverified
- The rule-based NewsIE may struggle with complex or ambiguous news content requiring deeper semantic understanding
- Scalability to larger, more diverse news corpora and different types of knowledge bases has not been established

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core framework concept of combining structured knowledge bases with LLM outputs via GCN
- **Medium confidence** in the reported performance improvements, given the limited dataset diversity and potential implementation-specific optimizations
- **Low confidence** in the scalability claims and cross-domain applicability without additional experimental validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the NewsIE module on additional news datasets to verify the consistency of relational tuple extraction across different news domains and writing styles
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing BERTGraph performance with and without the GCN layers across varying training set sizes to quantify the impact of structural knowledge integration
3. Evaluate the framework's robustness to noisy or incomplete knowledge bases by systematically introducing errors or gaps in the extracted relational tuples and measuring performance degradation
