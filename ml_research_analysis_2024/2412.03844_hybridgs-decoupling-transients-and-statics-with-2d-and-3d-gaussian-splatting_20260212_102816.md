## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.03844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03844
- Reference count: 40
- State-of-the-art performance on NeRF On-the-go and RobustNeRF datasets with significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HybridGS, a novel approach for novel view synthesis in scenes with transient objects. The key idea is to decouple transients and statics by using a hybrid representation combining 2D Gaussians for transients (per image) and 3D Gaussians for static scenes. This leverages the multi-view consistency of 3D Gaussians for statics while modeling transients as planar objects from single views. The method employs a multi-view regulated supervision scheme for 3D Gaussians and a multi-stage training strategy (warmup, iterative training, joint fine-tuning) to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis.

## Method Summary
HybridGS addresses novel view synthesis in scenes containing both static and transient elements by decoupling them through a hybrid representation. The method uses 2D Gaussians to model transient objects that appear only in single views, while employing 3D Gaussians for static scenes that maintain multi-view consistency. A multi-view regulated supervision scheme enhances the model's ability to distinguish between static and transient elements by leveraging information from co-visible regions across multiple views. The training follows a three-stage strategy: warmup with 3DGS to capture static structure, iterative training alternating between 2DGS and 3DGS with masks to progressively refine separation, and joint fine-tuning to integrate both representations for final optimization.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NeRF On-the-go and RobustNeRF datasets
- Significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM metrics over previous methods
- Effectively decouples transients from statics while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
- Ablation study shows 10k 2D Gaussians provides optimal balance between quality and storage requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The hybrid representation using 2D Gaussians for transients and 3D Gaussians for statics leverages fundamental geometric properties to decouple scene components.
- Mechanism: Transients lack multi-view consistency while statics maintain it. The method assigns 2D Gaussians (single-view) to model transients and 3D Gaussians (multi-view consistent) to model statics, naturally separating them based on their geometric properties.
- Core assumption: Transient objects appear in single views without maintaining consistent geometry across multiple views, while static objects maintain multi-view geometric consistency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians"
  - [section]: "The key observation is that transients lack multi-view consistency and usually only appear in a single view. Therefore, we consider them as planar objects at that view."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-view regulated supervision scheme enhances the model's ability to distinguish static and transient elements by leveraging information from co-visible regions.
- Mechanism: Instead of supervising on a single image per iteration, the method uses K images (batch-wise inputs) and focuses optimization only on 3D Gaussians within co-visible areas across cross-view frustums, allowing the model to learn mutual information from multiple perspectives.
- Core assumption: Co-visible regions across multiple views contain consistent static information that can help identify transient elements that don't appear in all views.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics"
  - [section]: "We adopt a sparse training schedule that focuses optimization only on the 3D Gaussians within the co-visible areas of the cross-view frustums"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multi-stage training strategy (warmup, iterative, joint) ensures stable convergence and effective separation of transients and statics.
- Mechanism: The warmup stage uses 3DGS to capture static scene structure, iterative training alternates between 2DGS and 3DGS with masks to progressively refine separation, and joint fine-tuning integrates both representations for final optimization.
- Core assumption: Gradual progression from simple to complex optimization stages allows the model to first establish a static scene foundation before adding transient modeling complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings"
  - [section]: "The second stage employs iterative training between 2DGS and 3DGS to progressively optimize both components"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-view geometric consistency in 3D reconstruction
  - Why needed here: The entire method relies on understanding that static objects maintain consistent geometry across multiple views while transients do not.
  - Quick check question: What geometric property distinguishes static objects from transient objects in multi-view reconstruction?

- Concept: Gaussian splatting representation and rendering
  - Why needed here: The method uses both 2D and 3D Gaussian splatting for scene representation, requiring understanding of how Gaussians are projected, rendered, and blended.
  - Quick check question: How do 2D Gaussians differ from 3D Gaussians in terms of projection and rendering operations?

- Concept: Uncertainty modeling and mask generation
  - Why needed here: The method uses uncertainty of 2D Gaussians to generate transient masks, which guide the separation between static and transient elements.
  - Quick check question: How is the uncertainty mask calculated from 2D Gaussian opacities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input images and camera parameters -> 3D Gaussian module (static scenes) -> 2D Gaussian module (transients) -> Multi-view regulated supervision -> Multi-stage training pipeline (Warmup -> Iterative -> Joint) -> Output novel view synthesis

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize 3D Gaussian from SfM point cloud
  2. Warmup stage: Train 3DGS on static scene structure
  3. Iterative stage: Alternate 2DGS (learn transients/masks) and 3DGS (refine statics using masks)
  4. Joint stage: Fine-tune both components together
  5. Render final image by blending static and transient components

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 2D Gaussians for transients reduces computational cost but limits representation to planar objects
  - Multi-view supervision improves static reconstruction but requires sufficient view overlap
  - Multi-stage training ensures stability but increases overall training time
  - The method assumes minimal illumination changes, limiting applicability to unconstrained photo collections

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor separation when transients appear consistently across multiple views
  - Artifacts when 3D Gaussians overfit transient objects during warmup
  - Blurry results when insufficient 2D Gaussians are used for transient modeling
  - Suboptimal performance in scenes with significant illumination variations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train on a simple static scene (e.g., Garden from MipNeRF 360) to verify the multi-view supervision improves stability compared to vanilla 3DGS
  2. Test on a scene with clear transient/static separation (e.g., Corner from NeRF On-the-go) to validate the 2D Gaussian modeling of transients
  3. Vary the number of 2D Gaussians (1k, 5k, 10k, 25k) on Corner scene to find the optimal balance between quality and storage requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the performance of HybridGS compare to semantic-based methods (like SLS-mlp) when applied to unconstrained photo collections with significant illumination variations?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses that their method hasn't accounted for illumination variation in unconstrained photo collections and mentions this as a future direction.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates HybridGS on datasets with minimal illumination changes (NeRF On-the-go and RobustNeRF) and doesn't test it on unconstrained photo collections with varying lighting.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Running experiments on Photo Tourism dataset or similar unconstrained photo collections and comparing results with semantic-based methods like SLS-mlp would provide concrete evidence.

- Question: What is the optimal balance between the number of 2D Gaussians and 3D Gaussians for different scene complexities and transient densities?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows an ablation study on the number of 2D Gaussians for one scene, finding 10k optimal, but doesn't explore the relationship between 2D/3D Gaussian numbers across different scene types.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only provides a single data point (10k 2D Gaussians for Corner scene) without exploring how this number should scale with scene complexity, transient density, or image count.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying both 2D and 3D Gaussian counts across multiple scenes with different characteristics (complexity, transient density, image count) would reveal optimal balancing strategies.

- Question: Can the hybrid representation be extended to model temporal consistency for dynamic scenes, rather than treating transients as purely view-dependent planar objects?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that transients are modeled as planar objects from a single view, lacking multi-view consistency, and don't account for temporal consistency in dynamic scenes.
  - Why unresolved: The current method treats transients as purely view-dependent without considering their temporal dynamics or motion patterns that could be exploited for better representation.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating temporal information (e.g., optical flow, motion segmentation) into the 2D Gaussian representation to capture dynamic object motion would demonstrate whether this improves performance on dynamic scenes.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades when transients appear consistently across multiple views, as the single-view 2D Gaussian assumption breaks down
- The method hasn't been validated on unconstrained photo collections with significant illumination variations
- Multi-view regulated supervision requires sufficient view overlap, which may not be available in all scenes

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The hybrid representation approach (2D Gaussians for transients, 3D Gaussians for statics) is technically sound and aligns with geometric principles of multi-view consistency.
- **Medium Confidence**: The multi-stage training strategy is well-motivated, but the specific implementation details and hyperparameter choices could significantly impact results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported state-of-the-art performance metrics (PSNR/SSIM improvements) are convincing on benchmark datasets, but the method's generalization to diverse real-world scenarios needs validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on scenes where transients appear consistently across multiple views to evaluate the breakdown of the single-view 2D Gaussian assumption.
2. Implement the multi-view regulated supervision scheme and verify its effectiveness in distinguishing static and transient elements compared to standard supervision.
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each training stage (warmup, iterative, joint) to the final performance.
