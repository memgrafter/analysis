core_contribution: The paper critiques externalist theories of reference in language
  models (LMs), arguing they fail to account for the complex cognitive and semantic
  mechanisms underlying reference. While acknowledging that some LM outputs may appear
  to refer, the authors contend this is an illusion resulting from superficial similarities
  to human language use.

# On the referential capacity of language models: An internalist rejoinder to Mandelkern & Linzen

- The paper argues that language models lack the cognitive and semantic mechanisms necessary for genuine reference to entities in the world.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a philosophical critique of externalist theories of reference as applied to language models (LMs). The authors argue that while LM outputs may appear to refer to entities in the world, this appearance is superficial and results from the lack of mental states, communicative intentions, and cognitive systems that humans possess. They contend that genuine reference requires internalist mechanisms that LMs fundamentally lack, making claims of referential capacity in LMs problematic. The paper suggests that LM outputs should be understood as being "about" topics rather than truly referring, and calls for new frameworks to assess the epistemic value of LM outputs beyond traditional truth/falsity evaluations.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a philosophical argumentation approach, analyzing the theoretical foundations of reference in language models through the lens of internalist theories of meaning. The authors examine claims about LM referential capacity and systematically critique them by showing how they fail to account for the complex cognitive and semantic mechanisms that underlie human reference. Their analysis draws on concepts from philosophy of language and cognitive science to argue that reference requires mental states and communicative intentions that LMs cannot possess by definition.

## Key Results
- LMs lack the mental states, communicative intentions, and cognitive systems necessary for genuine reference
- The appearance of reference in LMs is an illusion resulting from superficial similarities to human language use
- Claims about LM referential capacity rest on contested philosophical assumptions that may not be empirically testable
- New frameworks are needed to assess the epistemic value of LM outputs beyond traditional truth/falsity evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The argument works by identifying the fundamental differences between human language use and LM output generation. While humans use language with communicative intentions and mental states that connect words to real-world entities through complex cognitive processes, LMs generate text based on statistical patterns without any understanding or intentionality. This distinction between genuine reference (requiring internalist mechanisms) and apparent reference (superficial pattern matching) is central to the authors' critique of externalist approaches to LM semantics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reference vs. Aboutness**: The distinction between language truly referring to entities versus merely being about topics - needed to understand the core philosophical argument about LM limitations
- **Internalist vs. Externalist theories of meaning**: Competing philosophical frameworks for understanding how language connects to the world - needed to grasp why the authors reject externalist approaches for LMs
- **Mental states and communicative intentions**: The cognitive prerequisites for genuine reference according to the authors - needed to understand what LMs fundamentally lack
- **Truth-conditional semantics**: Traditional frameworks for evaluating language based on truth and falsity - needed to understand why new evaluation frameworks may be necessary
- **Computational linguistics vs. philosophy of language**: The disciplinary perspectives that shape different approaches to LM evaluation - needed to contextualize the debate

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Philosophical argument -> Critique of externalist theories -> Analysis of LM limitations -> Call for new evaluation frameworks

Critical path: The paper's central argument flows from establishing the philosophical requirements for genuine reference (mental states, intentions) through demonstrating how LMs fail to meet these requirements, to concluding that new assessment frameworks are needed.

Design tradeoffs: The authors prioritize philosophical rigor and internalist consistency over empirical testability, acknowledging that their claims about the necessity of mental states for reference are philosophically contested.

Failure signatures: The argument would fail if empirical evidence emerged showing that LMs can achieve functional equivalence in reference tasks without possessing mental states, or if a compelling externalist theory of LM semantics were developed.

First experiments:
1. Compare human and LM performance on reference tasks requiring understanding of speaker intentions
2. Test whether LMs can distinguish between referential and non-referential uses of language in context
3. Evaluate whether functional reference can emerge from statistical patterns alone

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges major uncertainties about whether its critique of externalist theories is fully warranted. The distinction between "aboutness" and "reference" is philosophically sophisticated but may not be empirically testable with current methodologies. There is uncertainty about whether the paper adequately addresses counterarguments from computational linguists who might claim that functional equivalence in reference could emerge from statistical patterns alone.

## Limitations
- The critique rests heavily on philosophical assumptions about the nature of reference that are themselves contested
- The distinction between "aboutness" and "reference" may not be empirically testable with current methodologies
- The paper may not adequately address counterarguments from computational linguists regarding functional equivalence
- The call for new evaluation frameworks lacks specific methodological guidance

## Confidence
- High confidence in the claim that LMs lack mental states and communicative intentions (this is definitional)
- Medium confidence in the broader claim that this precludes genuine reference (philosophically contested)
- Medium confidence in the assertion that we need new frameworks for assessing LM outputs (practically reasonable but not definitively established)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies comparing LM outputs with human language use in controlled reference tasks to identify where superficial similarities break down
2. Develop and test formal criteria for distinguishing "aboutness" from "reference" in computational systems
3. Survey philosophers of language and cognitive scientists to establish consensus (or lack thereof) on whether mental states are necessary for reference in all contexts
