# SEER: Facilitating Structured Reasoning and Explanation via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.13246
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13246
- Authors: Guoxin Chen; Kexin Tang; Chao Yang; Fuying Ye; Yu Qiao; Yiming Qian
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SEER achieves 6.9% absolute improvement over RL-based methods on EntailmentBank and 4.4% average improvement on STREET benchmark

## Executive Summary
SEER introduces a reinforcement learning framework for structured reasoning and explanation in question-answering systems. The key innovation is a structure-based return that captures hierarchical and branching dependencies in reasoning steps, combined with a fine-grained reward function that distinguishes between correct, erroneous, and redundant actions. SEER demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks while maintaining strong efficiency and generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
SEER uses a T5-large-based generative model policy with top-k sampling to explore reasoning steps, guided by a structure-based return that captures tree/graph relationships rather than simple trajectories. The framework employs a fine-grained reward function (+1 for correct, -0.5 for redundant, -1 for erroneous) and PPO optimization with supervised warm-up. A separate entailment module generates intermediate conclusions, while a critic network estimates state values using the structure-based return calculation.

## Key Results
- 6.9% absolute improvement over RL-based methods on EntailmentBank benchmark
- 4.4% average improvement on STREET benchmark
- Demonstrates outstanding efficiency and cross-dataset generalization performance
- Achieves strong results on eQASC and eOBQA cross-dataset evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Structure-based return captures hierarchical and branching dependencies in structured reasoning by defining returns using parent-child relationships. This evaluates states based on their position in tree/graph structures rather than sequence in trajectories. Core assumption: logical dependencies follow tree/graph structures. Evidence: [abstract] and [section 3.3] claim improved capture of intricate relationships, though corpus support is weak.

### Mechanism 2
Fine-grained reward function distinguishes between correct, erroneous, and redundant steps by assigning different values (+1, -0.5, -1). This provides nuanced feedback during exploration, with core assumption that exploration requires different penalties for innocuous vs harmful actions. Evidence: [abstract] and [section 3.3] describe the approach, but corpus lacks direct support.

### Mechanism 3
Generative model policy expands action space beyond pairwise premises by sampling from arbitrary combinations rather than limiting to pairs. Core assumption: complex reasoning requires combining more than two premises at once. Evidence: [section 3.3] explains expansion capability, but corpus doesn't explicitly discuss generative model approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning with policy gradient methods (PPO)
  - Why needed here: To learn optimal structured reasoning policies through trial and error while maintaining stability
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between policy gradient methods and value-based RL approaches?

- Concept: Tree/graph structured data representation
  - Why needed here: Structured reasoning tasks inherently involve hierarchical relationships that must be captured in both data and algorithm design
  - Quick check question: How does representing reasoning steps as tree structures differ from linear sequences in terms of information capture?

- Concept: Supervised warm-up for RL initialization
  - Why needed here: Provides stable initial policy that can adapt more quickly to complex reasoning environments
  - Quick check question: Why is supervised warm-up particularly beneficial for complex reasoning tasks compared to random initialization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State {hypothesis, existing steps, candidate sentences} → Policy T5-large-based generative model with top-k sampling → Action → Entailment Module Fine-tuned T5-large → Reward Fine-grained rewards → Update (policy/critic)
- Critical path: State → Policy → Action → Entailment Module → Reward → Update (policy/critic)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Generative model vs enumerated action space: Better coverage vs computational efficiency
  - Fine-grained rewards vs simpler reward schemes: More nuanced feedback vs easier implementation
  - Structure-based return vs chained return: Better logical capture vs simpler calculation
- Failure signatures:
  - Policy stuck in local optima: Check reward function balance and exploration parameters
  - Critic instability: Verify structure-based return implementation and learning rate
  - Excessive computation time: Review top-k sampling and action space pruning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare structure-based return vs chained return on small tree-structured dataset
  2. Test different reward values for redundant steps to find optimal balance
  3. Validate top-k sampling effectiveness vs full action space enumeration on simple reasoning task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can SEER be adapted to handle multimodal structured reasoning tasks involving images, tables, or audio data? Basis: [explicit] The authors mention this as a limitation and future work direction, noting that structured reasoning in multimodal contexts is increasingly prevalent and demanding in real-world scenarios. Why unresolved: The current SEER framework is designed for text-based structured reasoning and doesn't have mechanisms to process or integrate information from other modalities. What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of SEER that successfully handles multimodal data, demonstrating improved performance on reasoning tasks involving multiple data types compared to text-only approaches.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in the fine-grained reward function, particularly regarding the penalty for redundant steps? Basis: [explicit] The authors mention that they found appropriate penalization of redundant steps contributes to improved reasoning performance, but don't provide an optimal value or methodology for determining this balance. Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed penalty value of -0.5 for redundant steps but doesn't explore how different penalty values affect performance across various reasoning tasks or domains. What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing how varying the redundant step penalty affects reasoning performance across different datasets and task complexities, identifying optimal penalty ranges.

### Open Question 3
How does the structure-based return perform in scenarios with complex graph structures where nodes have multiple parent nodes and cycles? Basis: [inferred] While the paper claims the structure-based return works for graph-based reasoning, the evaluation focuses on tree-structured reasoning and relatively simple graph structures in the STREET benchmark. Why unresolved: The current implementation and evaluation don't thoroughly test scenarios with complex graph topologies, including cycles or nodes with multiple parents beyond the basic cases presented. What evidence would resolve it: Performance comparisons on datasets with increasingly complex graph structures, including those with cycles and multiple parent relationships, showing how the structure-based return maintains effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of mechanism claims, relying heavily on theoretical arguments
- Weak corpus support for key innovations, with average neighbor FMR of only 0.51
- No ablation studies comparing structure-based return against simpler alternatives
- Limited testing of complex graph structures with cycles and multiple parent relationships

## Confidence

- Structure-based return mechanism: Medium confidence - supported by theoretical arguments but limited empirical validation
- Fine-grained reward function: Medium confidence - the approach is logically sound but lacks comparative analysis with alternative reward designs
- Generative model policy: Low confidence - while promising, there's insufficient evidence of its effectiveness compared to traditional action space enumeration

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study of return types**: Implement and compare structure-based return against chained return on the same training setup to quantify performance differences across multiple structured reasoning datasets

2. **Reward function sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary reward values for redundant steps (e.g., -0.1, -0.5, -1.0) to determine optimal configuration and test whether fine-grained rewards improve sample efficiency

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Train SEER on EntailmentBank and evaluate on entirely different reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical problem solving or logical deduction) to assess the generality of the approach beyond the presented datasets
