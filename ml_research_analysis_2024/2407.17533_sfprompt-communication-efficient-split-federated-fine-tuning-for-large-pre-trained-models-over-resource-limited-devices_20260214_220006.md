# SFPrompt: Communication-Efficient Split Federated Fine-Tuning for Large Pre-Trained Models over Resource-Limited Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.17533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17533
- Authors: Linxiao Cao; Yifei Zhu; Wei Gong
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Achieves competitive accuracy to full fine-tuning using only 0.46% of local computing resources and 53% less communication cost

## Executive Summary
SFPrompt introduces a split federated fine-tuning framework designed for large pre-trained models in privacy-preserving, resource-limited environments. The method addresses the computational burden and communication overhead typically associated with federated learning by partitioning models into client-side and server-side components, introducing soft prompts, and implementing dataset pruning techniques. Experiments demonstrate that SFPrompt achieves competitive accuracy compared to federated full fine-tuning while significantly reducing both local computing requirements and communication costs, making it particularly suitable for distributed learning scenarios with resource-constrained devices.

## Method Summary
SFPrompt partitions pre-trained models into head and tail components (client-side) and body components (server-side) based on computational constraints. The framework introduces soft prompts into client-side models and employs EL2N-based dataset pruning to reduce local training data volume. Local-loss updates are performed to minimize server communication, with parameter aggregation occurring on the server using weighted averaging. The approach is evaluated on pre-trained ViT models across four image classification datasets distributed among 50 clients with limited computational capacity.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive accuracy to federated full fine-tuning
- Reduces local computing resource usage to 0.46% of baseline requirements
- Decreases communication costs by 53% while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SFPrompt's effectiveness stems from its strategic model partitioning that distributes computational load between resource-limited clients and more capable servers. By placing computationally intensive body components on the server while maintaining essential fine-tuning capabilities on clients through soft prompts, the framework balances privacy preservation with efficiency. The dataset pruning mechanism further reduces computational overhead by focusing training on the most informative samples, while local-loss updates minimize the need for frequent parameter exchanges.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Split Federated Learning** - Dividing model components between clients and servers to balance computational load and privacy needs
   *Why needed*: Addresses resource constraints while preserving data privacy
   *Quick check*: Verify that client-side components can perform meaningful fine-tuning independently

2. **Soft Prompt Engineering** - Lightweight parameter additions that guide model behavior during fine-tuning
   *Why needed*: Enables effective fine-tuning without modifying core model parameters
   *Quick check*: Confirm soft prompts can be trained efficiently on resource-limited devices

3. **EL2N Scoring for Dataset Pruning** - Using Easy, Learning, Noisy (EL2N) scores to filter training samples
   *Why needed*: Reduces computational burden by focusing on informative data points
   *Quick check*: Validate that pruned datasets maintain representative sample diversity

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Client-side (Head, Soft Prompts, Tail) -> Server-side (Body) -> Parameter Aggregation

**Critical Path**: Local dataset pruning → Client-side soft prompt fine-tuning → Local-loss updates → Server-side body parameter updates → Weighted aggregation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Client-side model partitioning based on computational constraints vs. accuracy preservation
- Dataset pruning ratio vs. information retention
- Local update frequency vs. convergence stability

**Failure Signatures**:
- Accuracy degradation indicates improper model partitioning or insufficient soft prompt initialization
- Communication overhead exceeding targets suggests dataset pruning thresholds are too conservative
- Slow convergence may result from excessive local-loss update intervals

**First Experiments**:
1. Test model partitioning strategy with varying computational constraint thresholds
2. Evaluate soft prompt dimensions and initialization methods
3. Measure impact of different dataset pruning ratios on accuracy and efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Exact partitioning methodology for determining head, body, and tail components is not explicitly specified
- Soft prompt architecture details and integration methods are somewhat abstract
- Sensitivity of results to dataset pruning thresholds is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- High confidence: Communication cost reduction claims (53%), local computing resource reduction (0.46%), overall framework architecture
- Medium confidence: Accuracy competitiveness claims, soft prompt effectiveness, dataset pruning methodology
- Low confidence: Exact implementation details for model partitioning, soft prompt architecture specifics

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the exact model partitioning strategy based on computational constraints to verify that the 0.46% local computing claim is reproducible across different hardware configurations
2. Conduct ablation studies on soft prompt dimensions and integration methods to confirm their impact on both accuracy and communication efficiency
3. Validate the EL2N-based dataset pruning algorithm by testing different pruning thresholds and measuring their effect on both accuracy retention and communication reduction
