# Learning to Solve Geometry Problems via Simulating Human Dual-Reasoning Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06232
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06232
- Reference count: 9
- DualGeoSolver achieves 65.2% accuracy on GeoQA and 65.1% on GeoQA+ datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DualGeoSolver, a geometry problem-solving system that explicitly models human dual-reasoning processes. Inspired by dual-process theory, the system uses two interconnected modules: Knowledge System (simulating System 1) for implicit reasoning through geometry knowledge retrieval and diagram information extraction, and Inference System (simulating System 2) for explicit reasoning via step-wise goal generation and program token generation. Experiments on GeoQA and GeoQA+ datasets show that DualGeoSolver outperforms 7 baselines and 7 LLMs, achieving accuracy of 65.2% on GeoQA and 65.1% on GeoQA+, with statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods (p < 0.01). Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component, with Knowledge Selection Module being particularly crucial.

## Method Summary
DualGeoSolver employs a dual-system architecture based on dual-process theory. The Knowledge System module handles implicit reasoning through knowledge retrieval and diagram extraction, while the Inference System manages explicit reasoning through goal generation and program token prediction. The system uses a Chain-of-Thought prompt structure with four types of thoughts: knowledge retrieval, calculation, conversion, and logical reasoning. Knowledge selection is performed using a deep similarity model, and diagram information extraction uses a modified Chain-of-Thought approach for image understanding. The architecture includes a routing mechanism to decide when to switch between System 1 (knowledge-based) and System 2 (inference-based) reasoning.

## Key Results
- DualGeoSolver achieves 65.2% accuracy on GeoQA and 65.1% on GeoQA+ datasets
- Statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods (p < 0.01)
- Outperforms 7 baselines and 7 LLMs in geometry problem solving
- Knowledge Selection Module shows particular importance in ablation studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from explicitly modeling human dual-reasoning processes through separate Knowledge and Inference Systems. By simulating System 1's implicit reasoning with knowledge retrieval and diagram extraction, and System 2's explicit reasoning with step-wise goal generation, the architecture mirrors how humans naturally solve geometry problems. The routing mechanism allows dynamic switching between reasoning modes based on problem complexity, while the knowledge base provides structured geometric facts and relationships that enhance problem-solving accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Dual-process theory: Understanding two distinct reasoning systems in human cognition is crucial for designing the dual-module architecture. Quick check: Can the system's performance be attributed to the separation of implicit and explicit reasoning?
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning: Enables step-by-step problem decomposition, essential for both knowledge retrieval and inference steps. Quick check: Does the CoT approach improve accuracy compared to direct answer generation?
- Geometry knowledge representation: Structured knowledge base with facts and relationships is necessary for System 1 reasoning. Quick check: How comprehensive is the knowledge base coverage of geometry concepts?
- Deep similarity matching: Used for knowledge selection to identify relevant geometric facts. Quick check: What is the accuracy of knowledge retrieval compared to human expert selection?
- Program synthesis: Translates reasoning steps into executable geometry programs. Quick check: How accurate are the generated programs in solving test cases?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Diagram/Question -> Knowledge System (Knowledge Selection, Diagram Info Extraction) <-> Inference System (Goal Generation, Program Token Generation) -> Answer

**Critical Path:** Knowledge Selection Module -> Diagram Information Extraction -> Goal Generation -> Program Token Generation -> Answer

**Design Tradeoffs:** The dual-system approach adds complexity but improves reasoning accuracy by separating implicit knowledge retrieval from explicit inference. The tradeoff between computational cost and reasoning depth is managed through the routing mechanism that dynamically switches between systems.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation when knowledge base lacks relevant information, diagram extraction fails to identify key elements, or goal generation produces incorrect intermediate steps. System may struggle with problems requiring creative reasoning beyond stored knowledge.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test knowledge retrieval accuracy by comparing selected knowledge against human expert selections
2. Evaluate diagram extraction performance by measuring identification accuracy of geometric elements
3. Assess goal generation quality by checking intermediate step correctness in solved problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas warrant further investigation including cross-cultural generalization, scalability to more complex geometry problems, and the extent to which the dual-process model captures human reasoning diversity.

## Limitations
- Accuracy improvements of 65.2% and 65.1% still indicate substantial room for improvement
- Reliance on specific knowledge base formats may limit generalizability
- Dual-process theory framework may not fully capture diverse human problem-solving strategies

## Confidence
- High confidence: Knowledge Selection Module importance in ablation studies
- Medium confidence: System's reliance on predictable human reasoning patterns
- Medium confidence: Generalizability to novel problem types and different cultural contexts

## Next Checks
1. Test DualGeoSolver on geometry problems from diverse educational systems and difficulty levels to assess cross-cultural and cross-difficulty generalization
2. Conduct user studies with expert mathematicians to evaluate whether the system's reasoning traces align with actual human problem-solving approaches
3. Perform stress tests with adversarial geometry problems designed to exploit potential weaknesses in the dual-reasoning simulation, particularly focusing on edge cases where System 1 and System 2 might conflict or fail
