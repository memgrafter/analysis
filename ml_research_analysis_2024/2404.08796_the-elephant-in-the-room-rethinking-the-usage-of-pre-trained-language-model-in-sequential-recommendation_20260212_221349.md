# The Elephant in the Room: Rethinking the Usage of Pre-trained Language Model in Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08796
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08796
- Reference count: 40
- The paper shows that PLMs are underutilized in sequential recommendation and proposes using behavior-tuned PLMs for item initialization with simplified ID-based models to achieve SOTA performance with better efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that pre-trained language models (PLMs) should be fully utilized in sequential recommendation (SR) tasks. Through extensive analysis of RECFORMER, the authors discover significant underutilization and parameter redundancy when applying PLMs to behavior sequence modeling. Their proposed solution combines behavior-tuned PLMs for item embedding initialization with simplified ID-based sequential models (SASRec or BERT4Rec), achieving comparable or better performance than complex PLM-based SR models while reducing computational overhead. The framework demonstrates substantial improvements across five datasets, with gains up to 34.29% in NDCG@5.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of two main components: behavior-tuned PLMs for item embedding initialization and simplified sequential models for behavior sequence modeling. First, a PLM (specifically Longformer fine-tuned as RECFORMER) is pre-trained on behavioral data from source domains to capture collaborative patterns. Item embeddings are extracted from this behavior-tuned PLM and used to initialize the embedding layer of simpler sequential models like SASRec or BERT4Rec. The sequential models are then fine-tuned on target domains while potentially keeping the pre-initialized embeddings frozen or partially trainable. This approach leverages the strengths of PLMs in capturing item relationships while avoiding their computational overhead in sequence modeling.

## Key Results
- Significant performance improvements across five datasets: +21.84% NDCG@5 on Arts, +17.03% NDCG@5 on Instruments, +19.03% NDCG@5 on Pantry, +34.29% NDCG@5 on Sports, and +12.83% NDCG@5 on Movies
- Behavior-tuned PLM initialization substantially outperforms vanilla PLM and random initialization
- Simplified sequential models (SASRec/BERT4Rec) with behavior-tuned embeddings match or exceed RECFORMER performance
- The framework achieves these results with reduced computational overhead compared to full PLM-based SR models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
PLMs contain significant parameter redundancy in behavior sequence modeling that can be exploited for efficiency gains. When fine-tuned for SR, attention distributions show functional stratification, but attention maps reveal substantial similarity across different heads and adjacent layers, indicating that full PLM complexity is unnecessary for behavior modeling.

### Mechanism 2
Behavior-tuned PLMs provide superior item embedding initialization compared to vanilla PLMs or random initialization. PLMs tuned on behavioral data capture user preference patterns and item relationships specific to recommendation tasks, creating item embeddings that better represent collaborative signals than semantic embeddings from vanilla PLMs.

### Mechanism 3
Simplified ID-based sequential models can replace complex PLM architectures for behavior sequence modeling while maintaining or improving performance. Classical SR models like SASRec and BERT4Rec have simpler architectures that are sufficient for capturing sequential behavior patterns, avoiding the over-complexity of full PLM architectures while leveraging behavior-tuned item embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- **Attention mechanisms in Transformers**: Why needed - The paper's analysis heavily relies on understanding attention patterns between PLMs and PLM-based SR models. Quick check - What is the difference between self-attention and cross-attention, and how do multi-head attention mechanisms work in practice?

- **Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning in deep learning**: Why needed - The paper distinguishes between behavior-tuned PLMs (pre-trained on behavioral data) and vanilla PLMs, and explores different fine-tuning strategies. Quick check - What are the key differences between pre-training objectives like MLM and recommendation-specific objectives like next-item prediction?

- **Embedding initialization strategies**: Why needed - The core contribution involves using behavior-tuned PLM embeddings as initialization for item representations. Quick check - How does pre-initialization with task-specific embeddings compare to random initialization in terms of convergence speed and final performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Item embedding layer (initialized from behavior-tuned PLM) -> Sequential model (SASRec/BERT4Rec) -> Output layer (next-item prediction head)

- **Critical path**: 1) Behavior-tune PLM on source domain behavioral data, 2) Extract item embeddings from behavior-tuned PLM, 3) Initialize sequential model with these embeddings, 4) Fine-tune sequential model on target domain

- **Design tradeoffs**: Complexity vs. performance (full PLM vs. simplified models), Pre-training cost vs. transfer benefit (amount of behavioral data needed), Embedding size vs. model capacity (matching dimensions)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on cold-start items not seen during PLM tuning, Overfitting with too many tunable parameters, Degraded performance with vanilla PLM embeddings

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Compare vanilla PLM vs. random initialization on a small dataset, 2) Test different parameter freezing levels in sequential model, 3) Evaluate performance across different amounts of behavior-tuning data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal layer configuration for PLM-based SR models to balance performance and efficiency? While the paper identifies parameter redundancy, it doesn't explore the theoretical minimum number of layers needed or whether this varies across datasets.

### Open Question 2
How scalable are behavior-tuned PLMs for SR across different dataset sizes and domain diversities? The paper shows small amounts of pre-training help but doesn't explore upper limits or cross-domain transfer with highly diverse item types.

### Open Question 3
What training objectives best align PLMs with behavioral knowledge for item initialization? The paper demonstrates behavior-tuning importance but suggests "identifying more appropriate training objectives" as future work without specifying alternatives.

## Limitations

- The attention redundancy findings are primarily demonstrated on RECFORMER and may not generalize across different PLM architectures
- The framework's effectiveness depends on availability of large-scale behavioral data for pre-training, creating uncertainty in data-scarce scenarios
- Performance on longer sequences (200-500 items) with complex dependencies remains unexplored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Behavior-tuned PLM embeddings provide better initialization than vanilla PLMs or random initialization; Simplified sequential models match or exceed RECFORMER performance with behavior-tuned embeddings; Framework reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.

**Medium Confidence**: PLMs contain significant parameter redundancy specifically for sequential recommendation; Performance gains are primarily due to better item initialization; Framework is universally applicable across different recommendation domains.

**Low Confidence**: Specific layer-wise attention patterns are generalizable across all PLM-based SR approaches; Performance improvements will translate directly to industrial-scale datasets; Behavior-tuning process is computationally efficient compared to full fine-tuning.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate attention analysis on multiple PLM architectures (BERT, GPT-2, Longformer) to verify whether parameter redundancy is architecture-specific or general.

2. Conduct experiments varying behavior-tuning data amounts (0.1%, 1%, 10%, 100% of source domain data) to establish the data efficiency curve.

3. Test the framework on longer sequences (200-500 items) and datasets with more complex sequential dependencies to evaluate simplified model performance.
