# Interactive Event Sifting using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05359
- Reference count: 19
- Proposed a Bayesian GNN method achieving F1-scores of 77.0%, 77.0%, and 77.8% at 18, 34, and 50 labeled instances respectively for social media event sifting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a human-in-the-loop method for sifting relevant events from social media posts during forensic investigations. The approach combines CLIP-extracted image and text features into a graph structure processed by a Bayesian Graph Neural Network (BGNN). Through active learning with pseudo-labeling and data augmentation strategies, the method significantly reduces the number of manual annotations required while maintaining high classification accuracy. Evaluated on the CrisisMMD dataset, the BGNN approach outperforms standard MLP, GNN, and Bayesian MLP baselines across multiple labeling scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-stage approach to event sifting from social media posts. First, CLIP embeddings extract features from both images and text in each post, which are then combined into a graph structure where nodes represent posts and edges capture relationships. A Bayesian GNN processes this graph, providing uncertainty estimates alongside predictions. The system uses KMeans for initial instance selection followed by BALD-KMeans for iterative active learning rounds. Data augmentation includes incorporating posts from other events to improve model robustness. Pseudo-labeling allows the model to self-generate labels for high-confidence predictions, further reducing annotation burden. This combination of techniques enables effective performance even with very limited labeled data.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1-scores of 77.0% with only 18 labeled instances
- Maintained consistent performance (77.0-77.8%) across 18, 34, and 50 labeled instances
- Outperformed standard MLP, GNN, and Bayesian MLP baselines on CrisisMMD dataset
- Demonstrated effectiveness of combining data augmentation, pseudo-labeling, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging multiple complementary techniques to address the challenges of limited labeled data in forensic social media analysis. The graph structure captures relationships between posts, allowing the model to learn from context rather than treating posts in isolation. Bayesian uncertainty estimation enables principled active learning by identifying samples where the model is most uncertain, maximizing information gain from each manual annotation. Pseudo-labeling extends the effective training set by leveraging the model's high-confidence predictions. Data augmentation with posts from other events improves generalization by exposing the model to broader patterns. Together, these mechanisms create a synergistic system that maintains high accuracy while dramatically reducing annotation requirements.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks** - Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data by propagating information between connected nodes through message passing. *Why needed:* Social media posts have inherent relationships (replies, shares, similar content) that should be exploited rather than ignored. *Quick check:* Verify the graph construction captures meaningful relationships between posts.

**Bayesian Neural Networks** - Neural networks that maintain probability distributions over weights rather than point estimates, enabling uncertainty quantification in predictions. *Why needed:* Active learning requires reliable uncertainty estimates to select the most informative samples for annotation. *Quick check:* Confirm uncertainty estimates correlate with prediction accuracy.

**Active Learning** - A training paradigm where the model iteratively selects the most informative samples for manual annotation rather than using random selection. *Why needed:* Dramatically reduces annotation costs while maintaining or improving model performance. *Quick check:* Compare performance against random sampling baseline.

**CLIP Embeddings** - Contrastive language-image pre-training embeddings that capture semantic relationships between text and images in a shared embedding space. *Why needed:* Enables unified processing of multimodal social media content (images, text, captions). *Quick check:* Validate embeddings capture relevant semantic information for event classification.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** CLIP embeddings -> Graph construction -> BGNN -> Active learning loop (BALD-KMeans) -> Pseudo-labeling -> Final model

**Critical Path:** CLIP embeddings → Graph construction → BGNN inference → Uncertainty estimation → Active learning selection → Manual annotation → Model update

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational complexity (Bayesian inference, graph processing) for reduced annotation requirements. The graph structure enables context-aware learning but adds complexity compared to treating posts independently. Pseudo-labeling accelerates training but requires careful confidence threshold tuning to avoid propagating errors.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur if CLIP embeddings fail to capture event-relevant features, if the graph structure doesn't reflect meaningful relationships between posts, or if pseudo-labeling thresholds are set too low (propagating incorrect labels) or too high (missing learning opportunities).

**First Experiments:** 1) Validate CLIP embeddings capture event-relevant features through nearest-neighbor analysis. 2) Test graph construction by measuring performance with and without graph structure. 3) Evaluate pseudo-labeling contribution by comparing with and without pseudo-labeling at different confidence thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single CrisisMMD dataset, raising questions about generalizability to other event types and social media platforms
- Computational complexity of Bayesian GNN inference during interactive sessions not thoroughly addressed for real-time forensic applications
- Potential biases in CLIP embeddings and their impact across different cultural contexts or languages not examined

## Confidence
**High confidence:** The core methodology combining graph neural networks with Bayesian uncertainty estimation is technically sound and the comparative evaluation against standard baselines is methodologically appropriate.

**Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of the active learning strategy (BALD-KMeans) is demonstrated but could benefit from comparison with other active learning approaches.

**Low confidence:** The scalability of the approach to larger, more diverse datasets and real-world forensic workloads is not established.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Evaluate the BGNN approach on additional social media datasets covering different crisis types and languages to assess generalizability beyond CrisisMMD.

2. **Active learning variant comparison**: Conduct head-to-head comparisons with alternative active learning strategies (e.g., uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee) to quantify the specific contribution of BALD-KMeans to performance gains.

3. **Real-time performance benchmarking**: Measure inference latency and resource utilization of the BGNN model during interactive sessions to determine practical feasibility for forensic investigators working under time constraints.
