# A Survey of Geometric Graph Neural Networks: Data Structures, Models and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.00485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00485
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic review of Geometric GNNs with unified framework categorizing models by symmetry preservation approaches and applications across scientific domains

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews Geometric Graph Neural Networks (Geometric GNNs), which are designed to process geometric graphs—data structures that include 3D coordinates alongside typical graph features. Unlike standard GNNs, Geometric GNNs incorporate symmetry constraints (such as rotations, translations, and reflections) into their architecture, making them suitable for scientific applications like molecular dynamics, protein folding, and material design. The survey introduces a unified framework for Geometric GNNs, categorizing them into invariant GNNs, scalarization-based equivariant GNNs, high-degree steerable equivariant GNNs, and geometric graph transformers. It provides a comprehensive overview of data structures, model architectures, and applications across domains like physics, biochemistry, and materials science.

## Method Summary
The survey categorizes Geometric GNNs into four main approaches based on how they handle symmetry: invariant GNNs that transform inputs into rotation/translation-invariant scalars (distances, angles), scalarization-based equivariant GNNs that recover directional information by combining invariant messages with geometry, high-degree steerable equivariant GNNs that use spherical harmonics and Clebsch-Gordan products for arbitrary tensor representations, and geometric graph transformers that extend attention mechanisms to geometric graphs. The survey systematically reviews each category's architecture, provides a comprehensive overview of datasets and benchmarks across scientific domains, and discusses theoretical insights into model expressivity. The unified framework facilitates methodological development and experimental evaluation by providing clear categorization and comparison of existing approaches.

## Key Results
- Introduces a unified framework categorizing Geometric GNN models into invariant, scalarization-based equivariant, high-degree steerable equivariant, and geometric graph transformers
- Provides detailed categorization of applications across domains including single-instance tasks (molecular property prediction) and multi-instance tasks (protein-ligand docking)
- Demonstrates effectiveness of Geometric GNNs in tasks requiring 3D geometric understanding such as molecular dynamics simulation and protein structure prediction
- Identifies future directions including development of foundation models and integration with large language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Geometric GNNs extend message passing to 3D geometric coordinates by preserving symmetry under rotations, translations, and reflections.
- **Mechanism**: The model maps 3D coordinates into invariant scalars (distances, angles) or high-degree steerable tensors that transform predictably under E(3) group actions. These representations allow message passing to respect physical symmetries inherent in geometric graphs.
- **Core assumption**: That preserving equivariance/invariance improves generalization on tasks involving 3D spatial structure compared to standard GNNs.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "geometric GNNs incorporate symmetry constraints (such as rotations, translations, and reflections) into their architecture"
  - [section] "invariant GNNs...transform the input geometric graph into distance/angle/dihedral-based scalars that are invariant to rotations or translations"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on general GNN surveys, not specific geometric GNN mechanics.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Scalarization-based equivariant GNNs recover directional information by combining invariant scalars with the original geometry.
- **Mechanism**: First compute invariant messages from geometric features (e.g., distances), then multiply by relative coordinates to recover directional components. This allows updates to both invariant features and equivariant coordinates.
- **Core assumption**: That directional information lost in scalarization can be meaningfully reconstructed from invariant quantities and geometry.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "EGNN...first applies the relative distance for the update of invariant message, which is then multiplied back with the relative coordinate to derive directional message"
  - [abstract] "Geometric GNNs...preserve the directional information in each layer"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on general GNN architectures, not scalarization-specific mechanisms.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: High-degree steerable GNNs generalize equivariance beyond vectors to arbitrary tensor representations.
- **Mechanism**: Use spherical harmonics to map 3D vectors to type-l steerable features, then employ Clebsch-Gordan tensor products for equivariant interactions between features of different types and degrees.
- **Core assumption**: That higher-degree representations capture more complex geometric relationships and improve expressiveness.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "TFN...computes the following equivariant point convolution: M_ij^L = Y(L)(x_ij/||x_ij||) ⊗_Wcg V_j^L"
  - [section] "CG tensor product...is SO(3)-equivariant regarding Wigner-D matrices"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't discuss high-degree steerable mechanisms specifically.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Group theory and symmetry transformations
  - **Why needed here**: Geometric GNNs rely on understanding how different groups (E(3), SO(3), T(3)) act on geometric graphs to preserve physical symmetries.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between equivariance and invariance under the E(3) group?

- **Concept**: Message passing on graphs
  - **Why needed here**: Geometric GNNs extend the standard message passing framework to incorporate geometric features alongside topological structure.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the message computation in EGNN differ from standard MPNN message passing?

- **Concept**: Representation learning with geometric features
  - **Why needed here**: Geometric GNNs must learn representations that encode both topological and geometric information while respecting symmetry constraints.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might a high-degree steerable representation be more expressive than scalar or vector representations alone?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input geometric graph (A, H, ⃗X) → Graph construction (k-NN spatial edges) → Message passing layers (invariant/scalarization/high-degree) → Pooling/Readout → Output prediction

- **Critical path**: Input → Graph construction (k-NN spatial edges) → Message passing layers → Pooling/Readout → Output prediction

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Invariant vs. equivariant: Invariant models are simpler but may lose important directional information; equivariant models are more complex but preserve full geometric information
  - Scalarization vs. high-degree: Scalarization is computationally efficient but may not capture complex interactions; high-degree is more expressive but computationally expensive
  - Full-atom vs. residue-level: Full-atom provides more detailed information but increases computational cost; residue-level is faster but may lose fine-grained details

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on tasks requiring directional information → May need equivariant rather than invariant model
  - High computational cost with marginal gains → May need to simplify to scalarization-based approach
  - Overfitting on small datasets → May need stronger regularization or simpler architecture

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Implement a standard invariant GNN (e.g., SchNet) and compare against a simple scalarization-based equivariant model (e.g., EGNN) on a molecular property prediction task using QM9 dataset
  2. **Symmetry validation**: Test whether predictions remain invariant/equivariant under random rotations/translations of the input coordinates
  3. **Complexity scaling**: Measure performance vs. computational cost for different model variants (invariant, scalarization-based, high-degree) on a fixed task to identify the optimal tradeoff for your specific application

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can geometric graph foundation models effectively scale to handle diverse data types (particles, molecules, proteins, crystals, RNAs) and tasks (prediction, generation, dynamics) simultaneously?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential for developing universal geometric graph foundation models that could span across different scientific domains and tasks, similar to how LLMs have succeeded in NLP.
- **Why unresolved**: While some initial works like EPT have attempted to pretrain unified models on small molecules and proteins, a truly universal model that can handle the full range of geometric data types and tasks remains an open challenge.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful development and evaluation of a single foundation model that demonstrates strong performance across multiple geometric graph domains (particles, molecules, proteins, crystals, RNAs) and diverse task types (prediction, generation, dynamics) without task-specific fine-tuning.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can we effectively integrate large language models (LLMs) with geometric graph neural networks to leverage domain-specific knowledge in scientific applications?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of integrating LLMs with geometric GNNs, noting that many scientific tasks require deep understanding of domain-specific knowledge that LLMs possess.
- **Why unresolved**: While there have been some attempts to use LLMs for molecular property prediction and drug design on motifs or molecule graphs, bridging them with geometric graph neural networks to process 3D structural information remains challenging.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Demonstration of a system where LLM knowledge enhances geometric GNN performance on 3D structure prediction/generation tasks, with quantifiable improvements over geometric GNNs alone.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What is the optimal balance between maintaining strict equivariance and allowing controlled relaxation of symmetry constraints for improved model performance?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the tension between equivariance's benefits for data efficiency and generalization versus the potential performance constraints of rigid adherence to equivariance principles.
- **Why unresolved**: While some pioneer studies have shown that relaxing equivariance to discrete point groups can improve performance, determining when and how much to relax equivariance remains an open question.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical studies showing systematic performance improvements when carefully relaxing equivariance constraints for specific scientific domains, with theoretical justification for when relaxation is beneficial versus detrimental.

## Limitations

- The survey provides extensive categorization but limited comparative analysis of when specific approaches outperform others in practice
- Theoretical analysis of expressivity is presented without empirical validation on challenging geometric reasoning tasks
- While applications across domains are discussed, the survey does not address practical challenges of deploying these models in real-world scientific workflows

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The categorization framework for Geometric GNN architectures is well-grounded in established group theory and has been validated across multiple published works
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about application effectiveness are supported by citations but lack direct comparative analysis within the survey
- **Low confidence**: Theoretical expressivity claims require empirical validation, particularly for high-degree steerable representations

## Next Checks

1. Implement controlled experiments comparing invariant, scalarization-based, and high-degree steerable GNNs on a shared molecular dynamics benchmark to quantify the practical benefits of each approach
2. Test symmetry preservation properties by systematically rotating/reflecting input coordinates and measuring prediction consistency across all model categories
3. Conduct ablation studies on the impact of different geometric features (distances, angles, dihedral angles) for invariant representations in protein structure prediction tasks
