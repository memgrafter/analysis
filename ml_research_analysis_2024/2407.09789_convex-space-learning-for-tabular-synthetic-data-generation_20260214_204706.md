# Convex space learning for tabular synthetic data generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09789
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09789
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: NextConvGeN achieves superior synthetic data utility with propensity score 0.0033 average, cross-validation difference 0.0506, and KL divergence 0.0059 average on biomedical datasets

## Executive Summary
NextConvGeN introduces a novel deep learning approach for generating synthetic tabular data by learning convex spaces of data neighborhoods. The model employs Feature-type Distributed Clustering (FDC) to identify meaningful neighborhoods and generates synthetic samples within their convex hull. Trained through cooperative learning between generator and discriminator networks, the system balances utility and privacy considerations. The approach is particularly effective for biomedical datasets where sample sizes are typically limited.

## Method Summary
The NextConvGeN framework operates through a two-stage process. First, it identifies meaningful neighborhoods in the data using Feature-type Distributed Clustering (FDC), which groups similar data points based on feature-type distributions. Second, it learns the convex hull of these neighborhoods to generate synthetic samples that preserve the underlying data structure. The model employs a cooperative learning strategy where the generator and discriminator networks work together to improve synthetic data quality while maintaining privacy constraints. This approach allows the system to capture complex data distributions while respecting the inherent trade-offs between utility and privacy.

## Key Results
- Outperformed five state-of-the-art models across ten biomedical datasets
- Achieved propensity score of 0.0033 average (vs. higher scores for competitors)
- Demonstrated cross-validation difference of 0.0506 (lower indicates better utility)
- Showed KL divergence of 0.0059 average (lower indicates better distribution matching)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its focus on learning convex spaces within data neighborhoods rather than attempting to model the entire data distribution globally. By identifying meaningful clusters through FDC and generating samples within their convex hulls, NextConvGeN captures local data structures more faithfully. The cooperative learning between generator and discriminator networks enables iterative refinement of synthetic samples, improving both utility and privacy preservation. This localized approach is particularly effective for biomedical data where relationships between variables can be complex and non-linear.

## Foundational Learning
- **Convex Hulls**: The smallest convex set containing a group of points; needed to ensure synthetic samples remain within realistic data boundaries. Quick check: Verify hull contains all original neighborhood points.
- **Feature-type Distributed Clustering**: Clustering method that groups data based on feature-type distributions; needed to identify meaningful neighborhoods in mixed-type tabular data. Quick check: Assess cluster purity by feature type consistency.
- **Cooperative Learning**: Training strategy where multiple networks work together; needed to balance generator and discriminator objectives for optimal synthetic data quality. Quick check: Monitor loss convergence patterns between networks.
- **Membership Inference Attacks**: Privacy attacks that determine if a data point was used in training; needed to evaluate privacy risks of synthetic data generation. Quick check: Measure attack success rate on synthetic vs. real data.
- **KL Divergence**: Statistical measure of distribution similarity; needed to quantify how well synthetic data matches real data distribution. Quick check: Compare divergence values across different models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> FDC Clustering -> Neighborhood Extraction -> Convex Hull Learning -> Generator Network -> Discriminator Network -> Synthetic Output

**Critical Path**: The core workflow flows from input data through FDC clustering to identify neighborhoods, then extracts convex hulls for each neighborhood. The generator creates synthetic samples within these hulls while the discriminator evaluates their quality. This cooperative process iterates until convergence.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model prioritizes utility over privacy, as evidenced by CTGAN and CTAB-GAN performing better in privacy metrics. This reflects the inherent tension between generating highly useful synthetic data and preserving individual privacy. The choice of convex hull learning over other distribution modeling approaches enables better handling of small biomedical datasets but may limit scalability to very large datasets.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor clustering quality in FDC leads to inappropriate neighborhood definitions, resulting in synthetic samples that poorly represent the true data distribution. If the cooperative learning between generator and discriminator becomes unbalanced, the model may generate either overly synthetic-looking data (high utility, low privacy) or data too similar to training samples (high privacy risk, low utility). Failure to properly learn convex hulls results in synthetic samples falling outside realistic data boundaries.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test FDC clustering on a simple two-dimensional dataset with known clusters to verify neighborhood identification
2. Generate synthetic samples from a single well-defined convex hull to validate basic generation capability
3. Run cooperative learning on a small benchmark dataset with visual inspection of generated samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Privacy assessment relies primarily on membership inference attacks, potentially missing other privacy vulnerabilities
- Evaluation focused on biomedical datasets limits generalizability to other domains
- Comparison against only five state-of-the-art models may not represent the full landscape of approaches

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Utility metrics and comparative performance claims are well-supported by standardized evaluation protocols and multiple benchmark datasets.

**Medium confidence**: FDC clustering methodology effectiveness lacks detailed ablation studies on neighborhood size parameters. Privacy-utility trade-off characterization is limited to specific attack types.

**Low confidence**: None identified in the provided materials.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extended privacy analysis using additional attack vectors beyond membership inference, including attribute inference and reconstruction attacks
2. Perform domain transfer experiments to validate performance on non-biomedical tabular datasets with different characteristics
3. Implement ablation studies varying neighborhood size parameters in FDC to determine optimal clustering configurations for different data types
