# Decision Transformer vs. Decision Mamba: Analysing the Complexity of Sequential Decision Making in Atari Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00725
- Reference count: 40
- Decision Mamba generally outperforms Decision Transformer in visually simpler Atari games, while DT excels in more complex games

## Executive Summary
This study compares Decision Transformer (DT) and Decision Mamba (DM) in Atari games, finding that DM generally outperforms DT in visually simpler games like Breakout, while DT excels in more complex games like Hero and Kung Fu Master. The performance gap is primarily influenced by action space complexity and visual complexity, with DM performing better in simpler environments and DT showing advantages in more complex ones. Random forest regression and correlation analysis confirm these findings, highlighting the importance of both action space complexity and visual complexity in determining model performance.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates Decision Transformer and Decision Mamba on 10 Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment, categorizing them by visual complexity (simple vs. complex) and action space complexity (measured by action count and variance). Performance is measured using mean and median human-normalized scores across multiple runs. Random forest regression is used to identify key factors influencing performance, while Pearson correlation analysis examines relationships between complexity metrics and performance differences. Statistical significance is assessed using t-tests to compare model performance across different complexity categories.

## Key Results
- Decision Mamba achieves higher scores than Decision Transformer in visually simpler games like Breakout and Space Invaders
- Decision Transformer outperforms Decision Mamba in visually complex games like Hero and Kung Fu Master
- Action space complexity and visual complexity are the primary drivers of performance differences between the two models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind the performance differences between Decision Mamba and Decision Transformer appears to be rooted in their architectural differences. Decision Mamba, being a selective state space model, may have advantages in environments with lower visual complexity and simpler action spaces due to its ability to process sequences more efficiently. On the other hand, Decision Transformer, which uses transformer-based architecture, might be better suited for handling the increased complexity in both visual and action space dimensions, leveraging its attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns.

## Foundational Learning
The study builds upon the foundational work in transformer-based models for sequential decision-making, particularly the original Decision Transformer paper. It extends this foundation by introducing Decision Mamba as an alternative architecture and systematically comparing their performance across a range of Atari games with varying complexity levels. This comparison provides insights into how different architectural choices impact performance in environments with different complexity characteristics.

## Architecture Onboarding
Decision Transformer uses a standard transformer architecture with attention mechanisms to process sequences of states, actions, and rewards. It relies on positional encodings to capture temporal information and uses self-attention to model relationships between different time steps. Decision Mamba, in contrast, employs a selective state space model that processes sequences through a series of state updates, potentially offering more efficient handling of long sequences. Both architectures are trained to predict actions based on past states and rewards, but their internal mechanisms for processing and relating information differ significantly, which appears to influence their performance in environments with different complexity profiles.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper raises several open questions regarding the generalization of these findings to other domains and the potential for hybrid architectures that could combine the strengths of both Decision Transformer and Decision Mamba. It also questions how these models might perform in continuous control tasks or real-world robotics scenarios, where the complexity characteristics might differ significantly from the discrete, visually-rich Atari environment.

## Limitations
- Focus on a relatively small subset of 10 Atari games, which may not capture the full diversity of sequential decision-making environments
- Binary classification of visual complexity (simple vs. complex) oversimplifies the nuanced differences between game environments
- Action space complexity metric does not account for the semantic meaning or importance of different actions within each game
- Limited exploration of hyperparameters and training configurations that might influence the performance gap between models

## Confidence
- High confidence in comparative performance claims between DM and DT across different complexity categories
- Medium confidence that action space complexity and visual complexity are the primary drivers of performance differences
- Medium confidence in the statistical significance of performance advantage differences due to small sample size
- Low confidence in the generalizability of these findings to non-Atari environments or real-world applications

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using a larger and more diverse set of Atari games, including intermediate visual complexity cases to better understand the transition point between DM and DT performance advantages.

2. Conduct ablation studies that systematically vary action space complexity and visual complexity independently to isolate their individual effects on model performance, controlling for other environmental factors.

3. Test both models on non-Atari sequential decision-making tasks (e.g., continuous control environments or real-world robotics scenarios) to evaluate whether the observed complexity-performance relationships generalize beyond the Atari domain.
