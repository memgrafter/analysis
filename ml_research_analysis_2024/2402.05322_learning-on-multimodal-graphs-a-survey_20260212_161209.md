# Learning on Multimodal Graphs: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05322
- Reference count: 12
- This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multimodal graph learning (MGL), categorizing existing works into three types: MGCN, MGAT, and MGCL, and discussing their applications and challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper surveys multimodal graph learning (MGL), a critical area for AI applications involving graphs with data in heterogeneous modalities such as text, images, and audio. The survey systematically categorizes existing MGL works into three predominant types: multimodal graph convolution networks (MGCN), multimodal graph attention networks (MGAT), and multimodal graph contrastive learning (MGCL). Each approach has distinct strengths and limitations in handling different types of multimodal graphs and tasks. The paper also summarizes key applications of MGL in multimodal knowledge graphs, biomedical graphs, and brain graphs, while identifying several remaining challenges in the field.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a comprehensive overview of MGL techniques rather than presenting a specific method to reproduce. It outlines the general methodologies of three main approaches: MGCN (using graph convolution operations), MGAT (employing attention mechanisms), and MGCL (utilizing contrastive learning). The survey describes how these methods handle different types of multimodal graphs (node-level, graph-level, temporal) and their respective strengths in data fusion and feature extraction. Implementation details and training procedures are not provided, as the focus is on categorizing and comparing existing approaches rather than presenting a new method.

## Key Results
- MGCN effectively captures cross-modal relations in node-level MGs through convolution operations but faces scalability limitations
- MGAT offers efficient training and long-range dependency modeling through attention mechanisms but may introduce modality bias
- MGCL excels at learning inter- and intra-modal correlations through contrastive learning but requires careful positive/negative sample design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MGCN is especially effective at extracting cross-modal relations in node-level MGs.
- Mechanism: MGCN propagates multimodal information through adjacency matrices and convolution operations, explicitly modeling the relations between heterogeneous nodes.
- Core assumption: The graph topology in node-level MGs accurately reflects the cross-modal interactions that need to be learned.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "MGCN is effective in learning complex interactions amongst heterogeneous nodes. In node-level MGs, neighboring nodes usually have heterogeneous modalities. By processing the multimodal adjacency matrix of a graph, MGCN can propagate the multimodal information residing in one node to its neighbors through convolution kernels, and thus, extract cross-modal relations amongst nodes to achieve effective data fusion"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - survey focuses on techniques rather than performance benchmarks.
- Break condition: If the graph topology does not meaningfully represent cross-modal relationships, or if nodes are not truly heterogeneous in their modality distribution.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MGAT can capture long-range inter-modal dependencies in MGs.
- Mechanism: Attention mechanisms allow each node to aggregate information from all other nodes in the graph, not just immediate neighbors, enabling global perception of inter-modal relationships.
- Core assumption: The attention mechanism can effectively learn which nodes across different modalities are most relevant to each other.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "MGAT excels in aggregating multimodal information globally over MGs. This is because the information fusion in MGAT is performed through an attention mechanism, which has long-range reach...MGAT is particularly advantageous when handling large-scale MGs."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - survey describes mechanism but not empirical validation of long-range dependency capture.
- Break condition: If attention weights become dominated by local nodes, or if the model fails to distinguish relevant long-range connections from noise.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MGCL explicitly learns inter- and intra-modal correlations through contrastive learning.
- Mechanism: By generating different graph views and contrasting positive/negative samples, MGCL guides the model to distinguish similarities and differences across and within modalities.
- Core assumption: The positive and negative sample design accurately reflects the true inter- and intra-modal relationships in the data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "MGCL explicitly emphasizes on extracting inter- and intra-modal similarities/differences from MGs. It generates different graph views from different perspectives (e.g., modalities), and then applies the contrastive learning strategy to those graph views to learn distinguishable node representations."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - survey describes methodology but doesn't provide empirical validation of correlation learning quality.
- Break condition: If positive/negative samples are poorly designed, leading to incorrect learning signals about modality relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph neural networks and their variants (GCN, GAT)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the base architectures that MGCN, MGAT, and MGCL build upon is essential for grasping how multimodal extensions work.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how GCN and GAT aggregate information from neighboring nodes?

- Concept: Multimodal learning principles
  - Why needed here: To understand why multimodal graph learning is distinct from unimodal graph learning and how different modalities interact.
  - Quick check question: In a node-level MG, why might it be beneficial to have different modalities across nodes rather than within each node?

- Concept: Contrastive learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: MGCL relies on contrasting positive and negative samples, so understanding this learning paradigm is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the main objective of contrastive learning in terms of the representations it tries to learn?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph construction (defining nodes, edges, and modalities) → Feature extraction for each modality → Graph neural network processing (MGCN, MGAT, or MGCL) → Downstream task-specific layers → Loss computation and backpropagation
- Critical path: Graph construction → Feature extraction → Graph neural network processing → Task-specific layers → Loss computation and backpropagation
- Design tradeoffs: MGCN offers strong local relation modeling but limited scalability; MGAT provides efficient long-range dependency capture but may introduce modality bias; MGCL excels at correlation learning but requires careful positive/negative sample design and may struggle with more than two modalities.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on cross-modal tasks suggests issues with modality fusion; overfitting to certain modalities indicates imbalance; failure to scale suggests architectural limitations for large graphs.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple MGCN on a node-level MG with two modalities and evaluate cross-modal relation extraction.
  2. Replace MGCN with MGAT on the same dataset to compare long-range dependency capture and efficiency.
  3. Add a contrastive loss component to the MGCN or MGAT to assess the impact on correlation learning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can MGCL be efficiently extended to graph-level MGs with more than two modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Extending MGCL to graph-level MGs with more than two modalities remains a challenge. Although MGCL can capture inter-modal similarities and differences when applying it to graph-level MGs, the contrastive loss function is usually implemented on two graph views [Lin et al., 2022]. How to efficiently extend MGCL to graph-level MGs with more than two modalities is still an unexplored question in this area. When there are more than two modalities, Equation 4 is no longer suitable. Thus, an advanced loss function is required to capture the relations between each pair of modalities, which may make the training process more complex."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a gap in the literature, noting that existing contrastive loss functions are designed for two graph views, but an extension to more than two modalities would require a more complex loss function.
- What evidence would resolve it: A novel contrastive loss function that can handle more than two modalities in graph-level MGs, along with empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can MGL models be made more robust to data imbalance across modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Data Imbalance across Modalities... Whether current MGL models can effectively handle such issues is a largely unexplored topic. As such, comprehensive studies that evaluate the reliability and trustworthiness of existing MGL models under moderate to significant modality imbalance will be highly valuable to this field."
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the lack of research on MGL models' performance under modality imbalance, which is a common issue in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies evaluating the performance of existing MGL models under various levels of modality imbalance, along with proposed strategies to mitigate the impact of imbalance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can temporal MGL be improved to capture spatiotemporal correlations in evolving multimodal graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Temporal Multimodal Graph Learning... Performing dynamic data fusion is a much more challenging task, as demonstrated by the theoretical analysis in [Zhang et al., 2023b]: Compared to the learning on static MGs, learning over temporal MGs requires the extraction of higher-order features, i.e., the spatiotemporal correlations amongst nodes. This challenges the learning capability of MGL models, especially on how to accurately align the information across different modalities on both the temporal and spatial dimensions."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the difficulty of capturing spatiotemporal correlations in temporal MGL, which requires higher-order feature extraction and accurate information alignment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Advanced techniques, such as continual learning or spatiotemporal graph neural networks, that can effectively capture spatiotemporal correlations in temporal MGL, along with empirical results demonstrating their performance.

## Limitations

- The survey primarily describes mechanisms rather than providing empirical validation of their effectiveness, lacking quantitative evidence for claimed strengths and limitations.
- Implementation details and hyperparameter settings are not provided, making practical reproduction challenging.
- The paper lacks specific evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets for each MGL category, making it difficult to assess model performance.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of MGL approaches into MGCN, MGAT, and MGCL, and the identification of their core mechanisms (graph convolution, attention, and contrastive learning respectively).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claims about specific strengths and limitations of each approach, as these are based on theoretical reasoning rather than extensive empirical validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that MGCL faces challenges extending to graphs with more than two modalities, as this appears to be a logical extension rather than empirically tested.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing MGCN, MGAT, and MGCL on benchmark multimodal graph datasets to validate the claimed strengths and limitations of each approach.
2. Implement and test the scalability of each method on progressively larger graph datasets to empirically verify the computational efficiency claims.
3. Design experiments specifically testing the hypothesis that MGCL struggles with more than two modalities by constructing and evaluating models on three or more modality graphs.
