# Spectral and Rhythm Features for Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.06927
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06927
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs outperform other spectral features in audio classification with CNNs

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the performance of various spectral and rhythm features for audio classification using deep convolutional neural networks. The study focuses on the ESC-50 dataset, which contains 2,000 environmental audio recordings across 50 classes. The experiments compare mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, and different chromagram representations. Results show that mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs significantly outperform other features, achieving training accuracies of 94.06% and 93.88% respectively, while cyclic tempograms and chromagrams exhibit substantially lower performance.

## Method Summary
The paper uses the ESC-50 dataset containing 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings, each 5 seconds long in .wav format. Various spectral features are extracted using librosa, including mel-scaled spectrograms, MFCCs, cyclic tempograms, and different chromagrams (STFT, CQT, and CENS). A deep CNN architecture with 13 layers is employed, featuring batch normalization, multiple 2D convolutional layers with 64, 128, and 256 filters, max pooling, dense layers with dropout, and softmax output. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, learning rate reduction on plateau, and early stopping. Performance is evaluated on training and validation sets with accuracy and loss metrics.

## Key Results
- Mel-scaled spectrograms achieve 94.06% training accuracy and 57.50% validation accuracy
- MFCCs achieve 93.88% training accuracy and 56.00% validation accuracy
- Cyclic tempograms and chromagrams show validation accuracies ranging from approximately 11% to 28%
- Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs significantly outperform other spectral and rhythm features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mel-scaled spectrograms outperform other spectral features because they match human auditory perception, emphasizing lower frequencies critical for environmental sound recognition.
- Mechanism: The mel scale compresses higher frequencies and expands lower frequencies in a logarithmic manner, which mirrors the human ear's sensitivity. This allows CNNs to focus on perceptually important features rather than evenly distributed frequency bands.
- Core assumption: Environmental sounds contain key discriminative information in lower frequency ranges that align with human hearing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better than the other spectral and rhythm features"
  - [section 4.1] "The Mel scale is designed to mimic the logarithmic perception of frequency by the human ear"
- Break condition: If the task involves high-frequency sounds where human perception is less relevant, such as ultrasonic analysis or certain musical harmonics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MFCCs are effective because they decorrelate the signal, separating excitation from filter characteristics, which improves CNN feature learning.
- Mechanism: MFCCs transform the signal into the cepstral domain where convolution operations become additions, making it easier for the CNN to isolate and learn relevant patterns. The discrete cosine transform further reduces redundancy.
- Core assumption: Decorrelating the signal helps the CNN learn more distinct and useful features for classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "The task of the coefficients is to represent the information of the audio signal in a decorrelated form"
  - [abstract] "mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better"
- Break condition: If the CNN architecture already includes sophisticated decorrelation mechanisms, the additional benefit of MFCCs may be diminished.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The deep CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers effectively learns hierarchical features from mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs.
- Mechanism: The CNN progressively extracts higher-level features through successive convolutional layers, with pooling reducing spatial dimensions and focusing on the most salient features. Batch normalization stabilizes training.
- Core assumption: Hierarchical feature extraction is beneficial for audio classification tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "Batch normalization layer to normalize the spectrograms on the frequency axis" and detailed CNN layer structure
  - [abstract] Results show high training accuracy (94.06% for mel-scaled spectrograms, 93.88% for MFCCs)
- Break condition: If the dataset size is very small, the deep architecture might overfit despite dropout and pooling layers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mel scale and its logarithmic frequency mapping
  - Why needed here: Understanding why mel-scaled spectrograms perform better than linear spectrograms
  - Quick check question: How does the mel scale differ from a linear frequency scale, and why is this important for human auditory perception?

- Concept: Fourier transform and spectral analysis
  - Why needed here: The foundation for converting time-domain audio signals into frequency-domain representations
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when converting a time-domain signal to a frequency-domain spectrogram?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and feature hierarchies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the CNN architecture extracts and learns from spectral features
  - Quick check question: How do successive convolutional layers in a CNN contribute to learning increasingly complex features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Mel-scaled spectrograms or MFCCs (2D representations of audio)
  -> Batch normalization -> Conv2D(64) -> MaxPool -> Conv2D(128) -> MaxPool -> Conv2D(256) -> MaxPool -> Conv2D(256) -> MaxPool -> Flatten
  -> Dense(256) -> Dropout(0.5) -> Dense(50, softmax)
  Optimizer: Adam with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss
  Callbacks: Learning rate reduction on plateau, early stopping

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess audio into spectral features (mel-scaled spectrograms or MFCCs)
  2. Feed features into CNN
  3. Extract hierarchical features through convolutional and pooling layers
  4. Classify using dense layers with softmax activation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using mel-scaled spectrograms vs. MFCCs: Both perform similarly, but MFCCs may offer more decorrelation
  - Deep CNN vs. simpler architecture: Deep CNN captures complex patterns but may overfit with limited data
  - Batch normalization vs. no normalization: Normalization stabilizes training but adds computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Low training accuracy: Model isn't learning the features effectively; check preprocessing or CNN architecture
  - High training accuracy but low validation accuracy: Overfitting; try regularization, dropout, or data augmentation
  - Consistently low accuracy for all features: Preprocessing or dataset issues; verify feature extraction and data quality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare training and validation accuracy for mel-scaled spectrograms vs. MFCCs to confirm similar performance
  2. Test a simpler CNN architecture (fewer layers) to see if deep layers are necessary
  3. Experiment with different batch sizes or learning rates to optimize training stability and convergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would other state-of-the-art CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) perform on the same feature sets for audio classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only uses a single CNN architecture, leaving open the question of whether different architectures would yield different performance across the spectral and rhythm features.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare multiple CNN architectures, so it is unclear if the observed feature performance is architecture-dependent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the same feature sets using multiple CNN architectures on the ESC-50 dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would incorporating temporal information (e.g., 3D CNNs, recurrent layers) improve the performance of cyclic tempograms and chromagrams for audio classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that cyclic tempograms and chromagrams perform significantly worse than mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs, but does not explore temporal modeling techniques.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses standard 2D CNNs, which may not be optimal for capturing temporal patterns in rhythm features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing 2D CNNs with 3D CNNs or CNNs combined with recurrent layers for cyclic tempograms and chromagrams on the ESC-50 dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the feature extraction parameters (e.g., window size, hop length, number of mel bands) affect the classification performance for each feature type?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses default parameters from the librosa package for feature extraction, but does not investigate the impact of parameter tuning on classification performance.
- Why unresolved: The optimal parameters for each feature type may differ, and the default parameters may not be optimal for the ESC-50 dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the classification performance of each feature type using different parameter settings on the ESC-50 dataset.

## Limitations
- Experiments limited to ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 recordings across 50 classes, which may not generalize to larger, more diverse audio classification tasks
- Only uses a single CNN architecture, leaving open questions about whether different architectures would perform differently across feature types
- Does not explore temporal modeling techniques that might benefit rhythm features like cyclic tempograms and chromagrams

## Confidence
- Superior performance of mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs: High
- Generalizability to other datasets and real-world scenarios: Medium
- Mechanism explanations for why these features work better: High
- Architectural choices represent optimal configuration: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the same feature representations on larger, more diverse audio classification datasets (e.g., AudioSet) to verify generalization beyond ESC-50
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs with and without batch normalization to isolate the contribution of each component
3. Evaluate model performance across different environmental sound categories to identify whether certain classes benefit more from specific feature representations
