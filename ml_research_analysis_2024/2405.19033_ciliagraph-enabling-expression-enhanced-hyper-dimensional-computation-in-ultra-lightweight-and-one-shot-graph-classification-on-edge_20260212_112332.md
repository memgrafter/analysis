# CiliaGraph: Enabling Expression-enhanced Hyper-Dimensional Computation in Ultra-Lightweight and One-Shot Graph Classification on Edge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19033
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19033
- Authors: Yuxi Han; Jihe Wang; Danghui Wang
- Reference count: 40
- CiliaGraph achieves 292x memory reduction and 103x training speedup compared to SOTA GNNs

## Executive Summary
CiliaGraph introduces an ultra-lightweight graph classification framework designed for edge computing environments. It leverages hyperdimensional computing principles to overcome the computational inefficiencies of traditional graph neural networks, achieving one-shot learning without iterative backpropagation. The framework employs non-uniform quantization encoding to preserve node distance isomorphism and weight-involved aggregation using hypervector similarities as edge weights. By concatenating node attributes with aggregated structural information, CiliaGraph prevents feature loss while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art GNNs with dramatically reduced computational overhead.

## Method Summary
CiliaGraph processes graph data through a multi-stage pipeline that begins with non-uniform quantization encoding of node attributes using K-means clustering to preserve structural relationships. Node attributes are mapped to hypervectors through level hypervector generation, where bit-flipping proportions are dynamically adjusted based on cluster center distances. The framework then computes similarity weight matrices using Hamming distances between node hypervectors, applies transition matrices to normalize weights by node degree, and aggregates neighbor information through weighted hypervector addition. Finally, original node hypervectors are concatenated with aggregated results to create comprehensive graph representations for classification through cosine similarity to class prototypes.

## Key Results
- Achieves 292x average memory usage reduction compared to SOTA GNNs across multiple datasets
- Provides 103x average training speed improvement while maintaining comparable accuracy
- One-shot learning eliminates iterative backpropagation requirements
- Non-uniform quantization encoding preserves structural relationships better than uniform approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Non-uniform quantization encoding preserves node distance isomorphism between graph and HD spaces
- Mechanism: Clusters attribute values using K-means based on actual distribution, then dynamically adjusts bit-flipping proportion based on Euclidean distances between cluster centers during hypervector initialization
- Core assumption: Node attribute distributions vary across different attributes and graphs, making uniform quantization insufficient for preserving structural relationships
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introduces a novel node encoding strategy that preserves relative distance isomorphism for accurate node connection representation"
  - [section 4.1] "Our approach dynamically adjusts the bit-flipping proportion based on the differences between non-uniform clusters"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found - weak corpus support for this specific encoding claim

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weight-involved aggregation captures structural information by using hypervector similarity distances as edge weights
- Mechanism: Constructs a similarity weight matrix using Hamming distances between node hypervectors, then applies a transition matrix to smooth node degree effects and create symmetric aggregation
- Core assumption: Edge importance varies based on node feature similarity and node degree affects information flow in graphs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "node distances are utilized as edge weights for information aggregation"
  - [section 4.2] "a similarity weight matrix WG ∈ R|V|×|V| is proposed for graph G, leveraging hypervector distances to effectively model relationships between connected nodes"
  - [section 5.4] "the performance of all three frameworks progressively deteriorates" when removing weight matrices

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Concatenation operation prevents node feature loss during graph-level representation
- Mechanism: Preserves original node hypervectors by concatenating them with aggregated topological information instead of bundling all results together
- Core assumption: Original node features contain unique attribute information crucial for comprehensive graph description
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "encoded node attributes and structural information are concatenated to obtain a comprehensive graph representation"
  - [section 3] "SG-HDC discards the original features of each node during the bundling process, retaining only the aggregated outcomes"
  - [section 4.3] "This preserves both node properties and aggregated topological information, enhancing the model's expressiveness"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hyperdimensional Computing fundamentals
  - Why needed here: CiliaGraph is built entirely on HDC principles - understanding high-dimensional binary vectors, binding operations, bundling operations, and similarity measures is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the binding (N) and bundling (L) operations in HDC?

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks vs HDC comparison
  - Why needed here: The paper positions CiliaGraph as an alternative to GNNs - understanding GNN limitations (computational cost, multiple iterations) helps appreciate CiliaGraph's advantages
  - Quick check question: Why does CiliaGraph achieve one-shot learning while traditional GNNs require multiple iterations?

- Concept: Quasi-orthogonality in high-dimensional spaces
  - Why needed here: The paper explores the relationship between orthogonality and dimensionality to reduce computational requirements
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical relationship between dimensionality and the number of quasi-orthogonal vectors according to Definition 2?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Non-uniform quantization encoder → Node encoder → Weight calculator → Transition matrix generator → Aggregation module → Concatenation layer → Prototype generator → Inference engine

- Critical path: Attribute quantization → Node encoding → Weight calculation → Aggregation → Concatenation → Prototype generation → Classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Memory vs accuracy: Lower dimensions reduce memory usage but may sacrifice accuracy
  - Computational complexity vs expressiveness: More quantization levels improve accuracy but increase computation
  - Uniform vs non-uniform quantization: Uniform is simpler but non-uniform better preserves structure

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor accuracy with uniform quantization indicates need for non-uniform clustering
  - Degraded performance without weight matrices suggests importance of edge weighting
  - Loss of node-specific features indicates bundling operations are too aggressive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test accuracy degradation when replacing non-uniform with uniform quantization on datasets with known attribute distributions
  2. Measure performance impact of removing similarity weight matrix vs transition matrix separately
  3. Compare classification accuracy across different dimensionalities to verify theoretical minimum dimension predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CiliaGraph's performance scale with graph size and complexity beyond the tested datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions testing on multiple real-world datasets but doesn't explicitly explore performance scaling with graph size or complexity.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on accuracy and efficiency comparisons rather than analyzing how performance changes with increasing graph complexity or size.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying graph size and complexity parameters while measuring accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of dimensionality reduction possible with CiliaGraph's quasi-orthogonality approach while maintaining accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 discusses the relationship between quasi-orthogonality and dimensionality but doesn't explore the practical limits of this reduction.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical framework but doesn't empirically test how far dimensionality can be reduced before accuracy degrades significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically reducing dimensions below the calculated minimum while monitoring accuracy degradation points.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would incorporating edge attributes affect CiliaGraph's accuracy and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges in Table 1 that CiliaGraph's accuracy is 6.48% lower than GNNs, likely due to the lack of edge attribute processing.
- Why unresolved: The framework focuses on node attributes but doesn't implement or test edge attribute incorporation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of edge attribute encoding within CiliaGraph's framework and comparison of accuracy/efficiency with and without edge attributes.

## Limitations
- Non-uniform quantization encoding mechanism lacks complete implementation details, particularly bit-flipping strategy and random seed initialization
- One-shot learning may have limited applicability to complex graph classification tasks requiring iterative refinement
- Performance on graphs with irregular structures or missing attributes remains untested

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (Experimental validation present, mechanism clearly demonstrated):
- Memory usage reduction of 292x average across datasets
- Training speed improvement of 103x average across datasets
- Concatenation approach effectively prevents feature loss (supported by ablation study)
- Weight-involved aggregation improves performance (supported by ablation study)

**Medium Confidence** (Theoretical justification with partial experimental support):
- Non-uniform quantization preserves distance isomorphism better than uniform approaches
- Minimum dimensionality calculation provides sufficient accuracy guarantees
- One-shot learning achieves comparable accuracy to iterative methods

**Low Confidence** (Limited experimental validation):
- Performance on graphs with attributes exceeding 4 dimensions
- Robustness to noisy or missing node attributes
- Scalability to very large graphs with millions of nodes

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study Replication**: Replicate the experiments from Section 5.4 to verify that removing the weight matrix causes 15-39% accuracy degradation, and that replacing non-uniform with uniform quantization causes similar performance drops.

2. **Dimensionality Validation**: Test the minimum dimension prediction formula D ≈ (m-1)²/(2 ln(2n)) across multiple datasets with varying attribute counts n to verify the theoretical framework accurately predicts sufficient dimensions for accuracy.

3. **Edge Case Performance**: Evaluate CiliaGraph on datasets with highly irregular graph structures (scale-free networks, small-world networks) and compare performance degradation against traditional GNNs to understand the framework's limitations.
