# Unsupervised Concept Discovery Mitigates Spurious Correlations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13368
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13368
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: 3% improvement on Waterbirds dataset compared to state-of-the-art group-agnostic methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoBalT, an unsupervised concept discovery method that mitigates spurious correlations without requiring human-labeled subgroup annotations. The method operates by first discovering discrete concepts through object-centric representation learning and then balancing these concepts during classifier training using concept-aware importance sampling. Experiments demonstrate that CoBalT effectively addresses spurious correlations while maintaining or improving original test performance across multiple datasets including Waterbirds, CelebA, and ImageNet-9.

## Method Summary
CoBalT addresses spurious correlations through a two-stage approach. First, it learns concept representations using object-centric representation learning with spatial clustering and vector quantization to discover discrete concepts from data. Second, it trains a classifier using concept-aware importance sampling to ensure balanced representation of rare concepts. This approach eliminates the need for expensive group annotation while maintaining or exceeding the performance of methods requiring such labels. The method shows particular effectiveness on datasets with background-foreground spurious correlations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3% improvement on Waterbirds dataset compared to state-of-the-art group-agnostic methods
- Maintains competitive performance on CelebA dataset
- Improves 1-2% on ImageNet-9 background challenges while preserving original test performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to discover meaningful concepts through unsupervised representation learning and then explicitly balance their representation during training. By using object-centric representation learning with spatial clustering and vector quantization, CoBalT identifies distinct concepts without requiring labeled subgroups. The concept-aware importance sampling ensures that rare concepts receive adequate attention during training, preventing the model from relying on spurious correlations that may be present in the majority of training examples.

## Foundational Learning
- Object-centric representation learning: Needed to discover meaningful concepts from raw data without supervision. Quick check: Does the learned representation capture distinct objects or patterns?
- Vector quantization: Required to convert continuous representations into discrete concepts. Quick check: Are the quantized concepts semantically meaningful?
- Importance sampling: Essential for balancing rare concepts during training. Quick check: Does the sampling strategy maintain class balance while promoting concept diversity?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data -> Concept Discovery (Spatial Clustering + Vector Quantization) -> Concept-Aware Sampling -> Classifier Training

Critical path: The concept discovery stage is critical as it determines which concepts will be balanced during training. Poor concept discovery directly impacts the effectiveness of the balancing strategy.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity in the concept discovery stage for improved generalization. The choice of clustering method and quantization granularity significantly impacts performance.

Failure signatures: The method may fail when concepts are not well-separated in the learned representation space or when the number of concepts is incorrectly specified. Performance degradation typically manifests as continued reliance on spurious correlations.

First experiments:
1. Test concept discovery quality on a simple synthetic dataset with known spurious correlations
2. Evaluate the impact of different clustering algorithms on concept discovery
3. Assess the sensitivity of the method to the number of discovered concepts
