core_contribution: The paper introduces a hybrid search approach combining keyword-based
  search, semantic embeddings, and LLM-generated structured queries to improve document
  retrieval accuracy. By integrating these complementary methods, the model captures
  both explicit and implicit user intent, overcoming the limitations of traditional
  keyword-only searches.

# Hybrid Semantic Search: Unveiling User Intent Beyond Keywords

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.09236
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09236
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Hybrid approach combining keyword, semantic, and LLM-based query structuring improves document retrieval accuracy

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces a hybrid search approach that combines keyword-based search, semantic embeddings, and LLM-generated structured queries to improve document retrieval accuracy. This multi-modal system captures both explicit and implicit user intent by leveraging the complementary strengths of different retrieval methods. The approach addresses limitations of traditional keyword-only searches by incorporating semantic understanding and intelligent query structuring.

## Method Summary
The hybrid system integrates three complementary retrieval methods: LLM-based query structuring to extract entities and generate precise structured queries, keyword search for exact term matching, and semantic search using vector embeddings to find contextually related content. Results from these methods are combined using Reciprocal Rank Fusion to prioritize the most relevant documents. The LLM component parses user queries to identify entities and relationships, structuring them into search queries that balance precision and recall.

## Key Results
- Improved retrieval accuracy through multi-modal approach combining keyword, semantic, and LLM-based methods
- Enhanced ability to capture implicit user intent beyond literal keyword matching
- Demonstrated robustness across diverse query types through complementary method integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different retrieval paradigms. Keyword search provides precision for exact term matching, semantic search captures contextual relationships and semantic similarity, and LLM-based query structuring extracts entities and relationships that users may not explicitly mention. By combining these methods through Reciprocal Rank Fusion, the system can handle a wider range of query types and user intents than any single approach alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vector Embeddings**: Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning; needed to understand semantic search capability and measure contextual similarity
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**: Method for combining ranked lists from multiple retrieval systems; needed to understand how results from different methods are aggregated
- **Entity Extraction**: Process of identifying and classifying named entities in text; needed to understand LLM's role in query structuring
- **Query Structuring**: Transformation of natural language queries into structured search queries; needed to understand how LLMs enhance search precision
- **Keyword vs Semantic Search**: Distinction between exact term matching and meaning-based retrieval; needed to understand the complementary nature of the hybrid approach

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Query -> LLM Query Structuring -> (Keyword Search + Semantic Search + Structured Query Search) -> Reciprocal Rank Fusion -> Ranked Results
- **Critical Path**: User query flows through LLM for structuring, then simultaneously through three search methods, with results merged via RRF
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs computational overhead; precision vs recall balance; complexity of multi-method integration vs simplicity of single-method approaches
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor entity extraction by LLM leading to irrelevant structured queries; semantic search noise overwhelming precise keyword results; RRF aggregation not properly calibrated across methods
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Compare retrieval accuracy of hybrid approach vs individual methods on standard IR benchmarks
  2. Measure computational overhead and latency compared to traditional keyword search
  3. Test robustness across different query types (specific vs broad, technical vs general)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Significant computational overhead from combining three retrieval methods plus RRF aggregation
- LLM-based query structuring performance depends heavily on LLM quality and may struggle with ambiguous queries
- Evaluation metrics and datasets not detailed, making it difficult to assess statistical significance of improvements

## Confidence
- **High confidence in:** Conceptual framework combining keyword, semantic, and LLM-based methods is valid and addresses known limitations of keyword-only search
- **Medium confidence in:** Claims of improved accuracy and robustness, pending detailed evaluation methodology
- **Low confidence in:** Practical scalability and efficiency for production deployment given multiple computational steps

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing retrieval accuracy when using only two of the three components versus the full hybrid approach
2. Perform head-to-head comparisons against established hybrid retrieval systems using standard IR benchmark datasets
3. Implement latency and resource usage measurements across different query volumes and document corpus sizes
