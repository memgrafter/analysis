# Policy Learning for Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Rewards

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.03329
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03329
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a principled policy learning framework for balancing short-term and long-term rewards, addressing the challenge of missing long-term outcomes and confounding bias.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel policy learning framework that effectively balances short-term and long-term rewards. The key innovation lies in deriving efficient estimators for both types of rewards by leveraging their efficient influence functions and semiparametric efficiency bounds. The proposed method addresses the challenges of missing long-term outcomes and confounding bias, which are common issues in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing higher balanced rewards compared to baselines that maximize only short-term or long-term rewards.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a principled policy learning framework that balances short-term and long-term rewards by deriving efficient estimators for both types of rewards. The key idea is to leverage the efficient influence functions and semiparametric efficiency bounds of the short-term and long-term rewards. The short-term outcomes contribute to improving the estimator of long-term rewards, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the balanced reward. The method involves learning policies that maximize the estimated balanced reward, taking into account the potential missingness of long-term outcomes and confounding bias.

## Key Results
- The proposed method demonstrates higher balanced rewards compared to baselines that maximize only short-term or long-term rewards on two real-world datasets.
- Theoretical analysis establishes consistency, asymptotic normality, and convergence rates of the regret and estimation error for the learned policy.
- The method effectively addresses the challenges of missing long-term outcomes and confounding bias, which are common issues in real-world applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by deriving efficient estimators for both short-term and long-term rewards using their efficient influence functions and semiparametric efficiency bounds. By leveraging the relationship between short-term and long-term outcomes, the short-term outcomes contribute to improving the estimator of long-term rewards. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the balanced reward, which is then used to learn policies that effectively balance short-term and long-term objectives. The method also addresses the challenges of missing long-term outcomes and confounding bias, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
1. Efficient Influence Functions:
   - Why needed: To derive efficient estimators for short-term and long-term rewards.
   - Quick check: Verify that the influence functions satisfy the required properties, such as unbiasedness and efficiency.

2. Semiparametric Efficiency Bounds:
   - Why needed: To establish the optimal estimation rates for the short-term and long-term rewards.
   - Quick check: Confirm that the bounds are tight and provide meaningful guidance for the estimation procedure.

3. Confounding Bias:
   - Why needed: To address the potential confounding effects that may bias the estimation of long-term rewards.
   - Quick check: Assess the extent of confounding in the data and ensure that the proposed method adequately accounts for it.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map:
1. Data Preprocessing -> 2. Efficient Estimator Derivation -> 3. Policy Learning -> 4. Evaluation

Critical Path:
1. Efficient Estimator Derivation: The core of the method, where efficient estimators for short-term and long-term rewards are derived using influence functions and semiparametric efficiency bounds.
2. Policy Learning: The derived estimators are used to learn policies that maximize the estimated balanced reward.
3. Evaluation: The learned policies are evaluated on real-world datasets to assess their performance in balancing short-term and long-term rewards.

Design Tradeoffs:
- The method trades off between the complexity of deriving efficient estimators and the improved accuracy in estimating the balanced reward.
- The use of influence functions and semiparametric efficiency bounds adds mathematical complexity but provides a principled approach to address confounding bias and missing long-term outcomes.

Failure Signatures:
- If the influence functions are not correctly specified or estimated, the efficiency of the estimators may be compromised.
- If the confounding effects are not adequately addressed, the estimated balanced reward may be biased, leading to suboptimal policies.

First Experiments:
1. Synthetic Data Experiments: Generate synthetic data with known confounding effects and missing long-term outcomes to validate the performance of the proposed method under controlled conditions.
2. Ablation Studies: Conduct experiments to assess the impact of each component of the method (e.g., influence functions, efficiency bounds) on the overall performance.
3. Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluate the robustness of the method to variations in the degree of confounding and the extent of missing long-term outcomes.
