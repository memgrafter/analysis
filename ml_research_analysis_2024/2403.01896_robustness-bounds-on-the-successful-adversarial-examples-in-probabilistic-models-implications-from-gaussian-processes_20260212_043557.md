core_contribution: This paper proves a new upper bound on the probability of successful
  adversarial examples (AEs) in Gaussian Process (GP) classification. The bound depends
  on the AE's perturbation norm, the kernel function used in GP, and the distance
  between the closest pair of training points with different labels.

# Robustness bounds on the successful adversarial examples in probabilistic models: Implications from Gaussian processes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.01896
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01896
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: New upper bound on probability of successful adversarial examples in GP classification depends on perturbation norm, kernel function, and distance between closest pair of differently-labeled training points

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes theoretical bounds on the probability of successful adversarial examples in Gaussian Process (GP) classification. The key finding is that the upper bound on misclassification probability depends solely on the kernel function parameters and the distance between the closest pair of training points with different labels, regardless of the overall dataset distribution. The authors validate their theoretical results through experiments using the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating that changing kernel function parameters affects the theoretical upper bound. These results provide a theoretical foundation for developing robustness enhancement methods in GP-based classifiers.

## Method Summary
The authors prove a theoretical upper bound on the probability of successful adversarial examples in GP classification using the Gaussian kernel. They train a GP regressor on a subset of ImageNet (10 classes, 500 samples each, 224x224 pixels), then craft adversarial examples by adding perturbations that move samples toward their nearest differently-labeled training points. The predicted mean μ and variance σ² are calculated for each sample, and both empirical misclassification probabilities and theoretical bounds (using Φ(-μ/σ)) are compared. The experiments vary kernel parameters θ₁ and θ₂ to demonstrate their effect on the theoretical bound.

## Key Results
- Upper bound on successful adversarial examples is determined solely by kernel function and closest pair of differently-labeled training points
- Changing kernel function parameters induces changes in the theoretical upper bound of successful adversarial example probability
- Distance between a point and its nearest point from a different class determines the success probability of adversarial examples
- Theoretical bounds are validated through experiments using ImageNet dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The upper bound on successful adversarial examples is determined solely by the kernel function and the closest pair of training points with different labels, regardless of the overall dataset distribution. This leverages the representer theorem and GP properties to show predictive mean and variance depend only on kernel values between the test point and two closest points from different classes. By fixing these two points, the maximum prediction variance is achieved, and the probability of misclassification is upper bounded by a function of this variance.

### Mechanism 2
Changing the parameters of the kernel function changes the theoretical upper bound of the probability of successful adversarial examples. Kernel function parameters affect the kernel function values between points, which in turn affect the predicted mean and variance in GP classification. The upper bound on the probability of misclassification is a function of these mean and variance values, so changing the kernel parameters changes the bound.

### Mechanism 3
The distance between a point and its nearest point from a different class determines the success probability of adversarial examples in GP classification. The probability of misclassification is upper bounded by a function of the distance between the test point and the nearest point from a different class, as measured by the kernel function. This distance affects the predicted mean and variance, which in turn determine the bound.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GP classification framework -> Theoretical bound derivation -> Experimental validation on ImageNet -> Implications for robustness enhancement
- **Critical path**: Grasp GP classification framework → Understand theoretical bound derivation → Interpret experimental results → Consider implications for robustness enhancement
- **Design tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between the tightness of the bound (which depends on the assumption about the negligible effect of other training points) and its generality (which allows it to apply to any translation-invariant kernel function).
- **Failure signatures**: The bound may not hold if the assumption about the negligible effect of other training points is violated, or if the kernel function does not provide a meaningful measure of distance or similarity.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify the theoretical bound on a simple dataset with known properties (e.g., two Gaussian clusters).
  2. Investigate the effect of changing kernel function parameters on the bound using a synthetic dataset.
  3. Apply the theoretical results to a real-world dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) and compare the bound to empirical results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the choice of kernel function affect the upper bound of successful adversarial examples in Gaussian Process classification?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper shows that changing the parameters of the kernel function induces a change in the upper bound of the probability of successful adversarial examples.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how different kernel functions affect the upper bound.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comprehensive study comparing the effects of various kernel functions on the upper bound of successful adversarial examples in Gaussian Process classification.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the theoretical results be extended to multi-class classification problems?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper focuses on binary classification, and it is not clear if the results can be generalized to multi-class classification.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not discuss the extension of the results to multi-class classification.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A proof or experimental results demonstrating the applicability of the theoretical results to multi-class classification problems.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the size of the dataset affect the upper bound of successful adversarial examples in Gaussian Process classification?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper does not explicitly discuss the impact of dataset size on the upper bound.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide any analysis of how the size of the dataset affects the upper bound of successful adversarial examples.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An analysis of how the size of the dataset affects the upper bound of successful adversarial examples in Gaussian Process classification.

## Limitations
- The theoretical bound assumes that the effect of training points other than the closest pair with different labels on the predictive mean is negligible (Assumption 1)
- Current analysis is restricted to translation-invariant kernel functions and binary classification
- The practical implications for robustness enhancement need more empirical validation across diverse datasets and attack scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The claim that the bound depends on kernel function parameters and closest pair distance is well-supported by both theoretical proof and experimental validation.
- **Medium confidence**: The assumption about negligible effects from other training points is reasonable but requires careful validation, particularly for larger ε values.
- **Low confidence**: The claim about practical implications for robustness enhancement, while promising, needs more empirical validation across diverse datasets and attack scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Assumption validation**: Systematically test the assumption that other training points have negligible effects on predictive mean by varying ε and measuring actual vs. predicted contributions from distant points.
2. **Multi-class extension**: Validate whether the binary classification bounds generalize to multi-class settings by conducting experiments with 3+ classes and comparing empirical results to theoretical predictions.
3. **Attack scenario robustness**: Evaluate the bound's applicability under different attack scenarios (white-box vs. black-box) and compare with existing robustness bounds for deep neural networks on the same datasets.
