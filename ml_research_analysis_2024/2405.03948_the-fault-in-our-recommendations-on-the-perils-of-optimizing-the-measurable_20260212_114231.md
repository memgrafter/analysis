# The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.03948
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03948
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Optimizing for engagement proxies leads to significant under-delivery on true user utility, but a utility-aware heuristic can achieve near-optimal utility with minimal engagement loss.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that recommendation systems optimized for measurable engagement proxies (clicks, watch time) suffer from significant utility loss compared to systems optimized for true user utility. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the authors show that engagement-optimal policies create popularity bias by only recommending popular items, while utility-optimal policies can explore niche content to better match user preferences. The key insight is that exploration can be done with minimal engagement cost when multiple items are recommended, allowing for near-optimal utility achievement without sacrificing much engagement.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes recommendation systems using a discrete choice framework with two item types (popular and niche) under a multinomial logit choice model. It proposes two main policies: the Always Popular Policy (APP) which maximizes engagement by recommending only popular items, and PEAR (Posterior-based Exploration-driven Adaptive Recommendations) which balances exploration and exploitation to optimize utility. The analysis uses a discount factor to model forward-looking behavior and examines the tradeoff between engagement and utility across different platform objectives.

## Key Results
- Engagement-optimal policies create significant popularity bias, leading to substantial utility losses
- The utility-aware PEAR policy achieves near-optimal utility while maintaining near-optimal engagement
- There is a stark asymmetry in the engagement-utility misalignment - significant utility gains are possible with minimal engagement loss as the platform becomes more forward-looking
- With discount factor approaching 1, the utility-aware policy achieves near-optimal utility with negligible engagement loss compared to engagement-optimal policy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Optimizing for measurable proxies like engagement can lead to significant under-delivery on true user utility.
- Mechanism: When a recommendation system maximizes engagement, it tends to recommend only popular items because they have higher average utility across the population. This creates a popularity bias that prevents exploration of niche items that might have high utility for specific users.
- Core assumption: User utility from niche items has high variance across users, with a small fraction deriving high utility while most derive low or negative utility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses"
  - [section] "Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement signals can lead to significant utility losses"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on diversity and novelty but don't directly address the engagement-utility misalignment
- Break condition: If user utility distributions for niche items have low variance or if the platform has perfect knowledge of individual user preferences upfront.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche items can achieve near-optimal utility while maintaining near-optimal engagement.
- Mechanism: By recommending diverse items early on, the system can explore and learn user preferences. Once preferences are identified, it can commit to recommending the preferred item type, achieving high utility without sacrificing much engagement.
- Core assumption: The platform can observe user choices and use them to infer preferences, and the ability to recommend multiple items enables exploration without significant engagement cost.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content... achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously"
  - [section] "our utility-aware policy PEAR... achieves approximately optimal utility... but also near optimal engagement"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention diversity but don't provide theoretical analysis of engagement-utility tradeoffs
- Break condition: If the platform cannot observe user choices effectively or if recommending multiple items is not possible.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: There is a stark asymmetry in the misalignment between engagement and utility - significant utility gains are possible with minimal engagement loss as the platform becomes more forward-looking.
- Mechanism: As the discount factor approaches 1 (more forward-looking), the utility-aware policy approaches optimal utility while the engagement gap between it and the engagement-optimal policy becomes negligible.
- Core assumption: Users' preferences are stable over time and the platform's discount factor is sufficiently high.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "in the limit of a forward-looking platform with discount factor δ → 1, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds"
  - [section] "we observe a sharp decrease in utility for a minuscule gain in engagement as we move from the utility-aware heuristic PEAR to the engagement optimal policy APP"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't discuss discount factors or long-term planning in recommendation systems
- Break condition: If user preferences change rapidly over time or if the platform is very myopic (low discount factor).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multinomial Logit Choice Model
  - Why needed here: The model assumes users choose items based on utilities with Gumbel noise, which is fundamental to deriving the engagement and utility formulas.
  - Quick check question: If a user is recommended one popular item with utility VP and one niche item with utility VN, what is the probability they choose the popular item?

- Concept: Multi-armed Bandit Framework
  - Why needed here: The recommendation problem is framed as an exploration-exploitation tradeoff where the platform needs to balance learning about user preferences with maximizing short-term engagement.
  - Quick check question: In the context of this paper, what represents the "arms" that the platform is pulling?

- Concept: Posterior Belief Updating
  - Why needed here: The PEAR policy maintains and updates beliefs about whether a user prefers niche or popular items based on observed choices.
  - Quick check question: If a user consistently chooses popular items when both types are recommended, how should the platform update its belief about the user's preference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Recommendation Engine -> User Choice Model -> Belief Update Mechanism -> Recommendation Strategy
- Critical path: 1) Recommend items → 2) Observe user choice → 3) Update posterior belief → 4) Update recommendation strategy
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing exploration (recommending niche items) vs exploitation (recommending popular items), and the tradeoff between short-term engagement and long-term utility.
- Failure signatures: 1) If the platform only recommends popular items, it may never discover niche items that users prefer. 2) If exploration is too aggressive, engagement may suffer significantly.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the APP policy and measure its engagement and utility performance under different discount factors.
  2. Implement the PEAR policy and compare its performance to APP, particularly focusing on the tradeoff between engagement and utility.
  3. Vary the parameter p (fraction of users who prefer niche items) and observe how it affects the performance gap between APP and PEAR.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What happens to the engagement-utility misalignment when the number of item types increases beyond two (popular and niche)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes only two item types (popular and niche) for analytical tractability. It mentions extending the model to incorporate many niche types as a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The current analysis is limited to two item types, and the structural misalignment may change with more diverse item types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments comparing engagement and utility under different numbers of item types, or analytical results for multi-type settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does user satiation affect the engagement-utility tradeoff in recommendation systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions modeling user satiation, where utility depends on past consumption, as a potential extension. It does not explore this aspect.
- Why unresolved: The current model assumes static utility and does not account for diminishing returns or fatigue from repeated exposure to similar items.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing how engagement and utility change under different satiation models, or analytical results for satiation-aware recommendation policies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of time-varying user preferences on the effectiveness of utility-aware heuristics like PEAR?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that user preferences may vary over time and that this could be an interesting extension. It does not explore this dynamic.
- Why unresolved: The current model assumes fixed user preferences, which may not reflect real-world scenarios where interests evolve.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulations comparing the performance of PEAR and other policies under different preference evolution patterns, or analytical results for time-varying preference models.

## Limitations

- The theoretical analysis assumes a simplified two-item-type model that may not capture real-world recommendation complexity
- The assumption of stable user preferences for effective posterior updating is unverified in practice
- The focus on specific choice models and utility distributions may limit generalizability to all recommendation scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that optimizing for engagement proxies leads to popularity bias and under-delivery of true utility is well-supported by the theoretical framework and numerical analysis
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that near-optimal utility can be achieved with minimal engagement cost through the PEAR policy is supported but depends heavily on specific assumptions
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of results to real-world systems with more complex item spaces, dynamic preferences, and imperfect choice observation remains uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation**: Implement the proposed policies on a real-world recommendation dataset (e.g., MovieLens, Netflix Prize) to verify if the theoretical engagement-utility tradeoff patterns hold in practice.

2. **Robustness testing**: Test the policies under different utility distribution assumptions (beyond Pareto) and choice models to assess how sensitive the results are to these foundational assumptions.

3. **Scalability analysis**: Evaluate how the performance of PEAR scales with the number of item types and whether the exploration-exploitation balance remains effective in high-dimensional item spaces.
