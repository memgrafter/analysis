# Multilingual Entity Linking Using Dense Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.16892
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16892
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Efficient multilingual entity linking achieved with limited resources using dense retrieval

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses multilingual entity linking (EL) by developing efficient systems that can be trained quickly on a single GPU. The approach uses lightweight bi-encoder models fine-tuned with in-batch sampled softmax and hard negative mining. Extensive experiments across 9 languages demonstrate that competitive EL performance can be achieved with limited computational resources, and cross-lingual transfer learning shows promise for languages with limited training data. The work provides detailed analysis of the DaMuEL dataset and showcases how to make multilingual EL more accessible through efficient training methods and publicly available datasets.

## Method Summary
The core method involves fine-tuning lightweight bi-encoder models (LEALLA) using in-batch sampled softmax and hard negative mining. Mentions and entity descriptions are embedded using a single shared model, with cosine similarity used for ranking. Hard negatives are retrieved using ScaNN indexing, and the model is trained with scaled cross-entropy loss. The approach enables efficient training on a single GPU while maintaining competitive performance across multiple languages. Cross-lingual transfer is achieved by leveraging multilingual models that map different languages into a shared semantic space.

## Key Results
- Competitive EL performance achieved with limited computational resources (single GPU)
- Cross-lingual transfer learning effective for languages with limited training data
- Detailed analysis of DaMuEL dataset reveals strengths and weaknesses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Using one shared model for both mention and entity embeddings speeds up training without harming accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: The model learns a shared semantic space where mentions and entities with similar meanings are close, regardless of input type.
- **Core assumption**: Contexts and entity descriptions have enough structural similarity that the model can learn to distinguish and embed them well in a shared space.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] states the work uses "lightweight bi-encoder models" trained on a single GPU, implying efficient single-model design.
  - [section] explains the choice: "one model is used" and "Using just one model offers several benefits."
  - [corpus] lacks direct evidence, but multiple papers in the results list mention "entity linking" and "dense retrieval," supporting the bi-encoder premise.
- **Break condition**: If contexts and entity descriptions are too dissimilar, the shared model cannot learn to represent both effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: In-batch sampled softmax with hard negative mining makes training efficient and accurate.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of comparing each mention to all entities, the model compares to a subset from the current batch, enriched with hard negatives to force learning.
- **Core assumption**: Hard negatives from the current model state provide meaningful gradients for learning.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] mentions "in-batch sampled softmax and hard negative mining" as core methods.
  - [section] details: "The examples we train on must provide a good approximation... we utilize hard negative mining."
  - [corpus] has no direct citations, but the cited papers in the result list all reference dense retrieval or entity linking, consistent with this approach.
- **Break condition**: If negatives are too easy, the model learns only mention-entity label matching and ignores context.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Cross-lingual transfer enables strong multilingual performance with training in only one language.
- **Mechanism**: A multilingual model fine-tuned on one language can embed mentions and entities from other languages in the same semantic space, allowing retrieval across languages.
- **Core assumption**: Multilingual models like LEALLA already map different languages into a shared space during pre-training.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] states "cross-lingual transfer learning shows promise for languages with limited training data."
  - [section] explains: "Cross-lingual transfer... is based on the assumption that a multilingual model represents various languages within a unified semantic space."
  - [corpus] includes papers like "SynCABEL: Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking," indicating broader multilingual entity linking research.
- **Break condition**: If the target language is too distant from the training language, transfer performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cosine similarity and L2 normalization**
  - Why needed here: The bi-encoder relies on cosine similarity to rank entities; L2 normalization ensures embeddings are unit vectors for correct cosine calculation.
  - Quick check question: If two embeddings are L2-normalized, what does their dot product represent?

- **Concept: Multiclass classification framing of EL**
  - Why needed here: EL is treated as choosing the correct entity from a KB, so understanding softmax and logits is essential.
  - Quick check question: What happens to softmax outputs if all logits are equal?

- **Concept: Hard negative mining**
  - Why needed here: The model needs difficult negative examples to learn beyond mention-entity label matching.
  - Quick check question: Why are randomly sampled negatives insufficient for context-aware EL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Tokenizer -> Mention/Entity Encoder (LEALLA) -> Cosine similarity layer -> ScaNN index -> Cross-entropy loss -> Adam optimizer

- **Critical path**:
  1. Embed mention with context
  2. Retrieve hard negatives via ScaNN
  3. Compute cosine similarities to positives and negatives
  4. Apply scaled softmax and compute loss
  5. Backpropagate and update model

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Single model vs. separate mention/entity models: saves memory and training complexity but may reduce specialization
  - ScaNN vs. brute-force: faster retrieval but slight recall loss
  - Smaller models (LEALLA) vs. LaBSE: more trainable on limited hardware but possibly slower per forward pass

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Model converges to constant embeddings -> logit scaling too low or no hard negatives
  - High recall on mentions only, low with context -> model ignoring context, needs harder negatives
  - Cross-lingual performance much worse than monolingual -> insufficient multilingual alignment in model

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train alias table baseline on DaMuEL, evaluate on Mewsli-9 R@1 and R@10
  2. Fine-tune LEALLA-small with batch size 32, neg=7, check R@1 after first round
  3. Run cross-lingual transfer: train on Spanish, evaluate on all Mewsli-9 languages, compare to OLPEAT baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of hard negatives impact the speed and effectiveness of the initial training rounds in bi-encoder models for entity linking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the use of hard negative mining and mentions that the first round of training, where hard negatives are not yet of high quality, leads to a slower learning process.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between using hard negatives from the start versus using random negatives in the initial rounds. It only suggests that hard negatives might improve training speed.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment comparing the training curves and final performance of models using random negatives in the initial rounds versus models using hard negatives from the start.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of cross-lingual transfer learning in entity linking vary across different language families and levels of linguistic similarity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that cross-lingual transfer is effective for some languages but not others, with Persian showing a notable drop in performance. It also suggests that the model might have difficulties linking from mentions in one language to entities in another.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides results for a specific set of languages and does not explore the impact of language families or linguistic similarity on cross-lingual transfer performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing cross-lingual transfer performance across different language families and varying levels of linguistic similarity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different sizes of pre-trained models (e.g., LEALLA-small, LEALLA-base, LEALLA-large) on the performance of fine-tuning for entity linking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that the LEALLA-large model underperforms compared to the smaller models (LEALLA-small and LEALLA-base) in the fine-tuning experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a clear explanation for why the larger model performs worse and does not explore the relationship between model size and fine-tuning performance in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more comprehensive study of the impact of model size on fine-tuning performance, including experiments with different model architectures and training regimes.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on DaMuEL and Mewsli-9 datasets, which may not fully represent real-world complexity
- Limited direct comparisons to state-of-the-art models trained with more extensive resources
- Cross-lingual transfer results need more extensive validation across all language pairs

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanisms of using a single bi-encoder model, in-batch sampled softmax, and hard negative mining are well-supported by the abstract and methodology sections.

**Medium Confidence**: Cross-lingual transfer learning results show promise but are based on limited training languages and need more extensive validation.

**Low Confidence**: Exact implementation details of hard negative mining and preprocessing steps are not fully specified, impacting reproducibility.

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the exact preprocessing steps for the DaMuEL dataset, including handling of special characters and normalization, to ensure faithful reproduction of the training data.

2. Conduct additional experiments training on multiple source languages (not just Spanish) and evaluate transfer effectiveness across all 9 target languages to assess the robustness of cross-lingual transfer.

3. Validate the specific implementation of hard negative mining, including the number of index rebuilds and sampling strategy, to ensure it aligns with the thesis methodology and impacts model performance as claimed.
