core_contribution: An international survey of 4,000 participants (1,000 each from
  China, France, Japan, and the United States) evaluated public perceptions of fairness
  metrics in decision-making scenarios. The study found that the choice of fairness
  metrics is most significantly influenced by national context, with France showing
  a strong preference for quantitative parity, while Japan and the US favored equal
  opportunity.

# Public Perceptions of Fairness Metrics Across Borders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.16101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16101
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fairness metric preferences vary significantly by national context, with France favoring quantitative parity while Japan and the US prefer equal opportunity

## Executive Summary
This international study surveyed 4,000 participants across China, France, Japan, and the United States to evaluate public perceptions of fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. The research examined how national context influences preferences for different fairness approaches including demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. Results showed that national context is the most significant factor affecting fairness metric preferences, with France showing strong preference for quantitative parity while Japan and the US favored equal opportunity. The study found minimal impact from religious affiliation and only minor gender differences, with males slightly preferring demographic parity.

## Method Summary
The study employed an online questionnaire administered to 1,000 participants per country, with demographic information collected alongside comprehension quizzes on four fairness metrics. Participants who correctly answered at least five of eight fairness metric quizzes were included in the analysis (targeting ~1,532 usable responses). The survey included three scenario-based questions with agreement scoring and single metric selection. Statistical analysis using ANOVA examined agreement levels while chi-square tests evaluated metric selection across countries and personal attributes.

## Key Results
- National context significantly influences fairness metric preferences (p < 0.001)
- France strongly prefers quantitative parity while Japan and US favor equal opportunity
- Gender differences were minimal with only weak preference for demographic parity among males
- Religious affiliation showed minimal impact on fairness metric selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fairness metric preferences are strongly shaped by national context, not just by demographic or personal attributes. Cultural and policy environments differ across countries, leading to distinct fairness interpretations. The study's finding that France strongly prefers quantitative parity while Japan and the US lean toward equal opportunity indicates that institutional and societal norms influence fairness judgments more than individual characteristics.

### Mechanism 2
Quantitative parity is perceived as fair in contexts where proportional quota aligns with national fairness norms. Quantitative parity enforces equal numbers regardless of group size, resembling affirmative action policies in countries like Japan. France's preference for this metric may reflect its universalism philosophy, where equal treatment is emphasized without adjusting for group differences.

### Mechanism 3
Equal opportunity is favored in countries where predictive accuracy is prioritized in fairness decisions. Equal opportunity ensures equal true positive rates across groups, aligning with merit-based evaluation systems common in the US and Japan. This suggests that fairness in these countries is linked to performance-based selection rather than equal representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Group fairness metrics** (demographic parity, equal opportunity, equalized odds)
  - Why needed: The study evaluates public perceptions of these metrics, so understanding their definitions and differences is essential for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check: What is the key difference between demographic parity and equal opportunity?

- **Cultural influence on fairness perceptions**
  - Why needed: The study finds that national context strongly affects fairness metric preferences, so understanding how culture shapes fairness is critical.
  - Quick check: How might a country's history with affirmative action influence its preference for quantitative parity?

- **Survey design and statistical significance**
  - Why needed: The study uses large-scale surveys and statistical tests to compare fairness preferences, so understanding how to interpret these results is important.
  - Quick check: Why is a large sample size important for detecting differences in fairness metric preferences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Survey design -> Data collection -> Statistical analysis -> Result interpretation
- **Critical path**: Survey design -> Data collection -> Statistical analysis -> Result interpretation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Large sample size for statistical power vs. potential sampling biases; multiple fairness metrics vs. participant comprehension difficulty
- **Failure signatures**: Inconsistent results across scenarios; low comprehension of fairness metrics; unexpected preference patterns
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate the study with a different set of countries to test generalizability of national context effects.
  2. Conduct in-depth interviews to understand the reasoning behind fairness metric preferences.
  3. Test the impact of different fairness metric explanations on participant comprehension and preferences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do fairness metric preferences vary across different countries and cultures?
- Basis in paper: The study found that the choice of fairness metrics is most significantly influenced by national context, with France showing a strong preference for quantitative parity, while Japan and the US favored equal opportunity.
- Why unresolved: The study only examined four countries (China, France, Japan, and the US). It is unclear how fairness metric preferences might differ in other regions or cultures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar surveys in additional countries and cultures to compare fairness metric preferences.

### Open Question 2
How do fairness metric preferences differ based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity?
- Basis in paper: The study found that gender differences were not significant, though males slightly preferred demographic parity. Ethnicity differences varied by country.
- Why unresolved: While the study examined some demographic factors, it is unclear how other factors (e.g., education level, income, occupation) might influence fairness metric preferences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting further analysis to examine the impact of additional demographic factors on fairness metric preferences.

### Open Question 3
How do fairness metric preferences differ based on the specific decision-making scenario?
- Basis in paper: The study used three scenarios (hiring, art project, and employee award) and found that the choice of fairness metrics varied depending on the scenario.
- Why unresolved: The study only examined three scenarios. It is unclear how fairness metric preferences might differ in other types of decision-making scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting surveys using a wider variety of decision-making scenarios to compare fairness metric preferences.

## Limitations

- Self-reported survey data may be subject to response biases and social desirability effects
- Translation of fairness metric explanations across four languages may have introduced interpretation differences
- Demographic filtering criteria beyond age and gender are unclear, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: National context significantly influences fairness metric preferences (p < 0.001) with clear statistical differences across countries
- **Medium Confidence**: Cultural norms drive fairness perceptions, though direct causal evidence is lacking
- **Low Confidence**: Gender differences claim requires caution due to weak effect (p = 0.0329) with small effect size

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a pre-registered replication study in 2-3 additional countries with different cultural and policy contexts to test the generalizability of national context effects on fairness metric preferences.

2. Perform cognitive interviews with participants to verify comprehension of fairness metric explanations and identify potential translation or conceptual misunderstandings that may have influenced responses.

3. Analyze the relationship between individual policy attitudes (e.g., support for affirmative action) and fairness metric preferences within each country to establish whether policy views mediate the national context effect.
