# Evaluating Language Model Character Traits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04272
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: This paper formalizes a behaviorist framework for evaluating language model character traits such as truthfulness, helpfulness, and coherence, treating these traits as measurable behavioral tendencies rather than internal states.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a formal behaviorist framework for evaluating language model character traits, treating qualities like truthfulness, helpfulness, and coherence as measurable behavioral tendencies rather than internal mental states. The authors operationalize traits through functions that map sequences of LM inputs and outputs to scores, enabling systematic comparison of consistency across different models, fine-tuning approaches, and prompting techniques. Empirical experiments reveal that larger and fine-tuned models exhibit more consistent beliefs and intentions, with traits like helpfulness improving significantly under few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting. The framework provides a precise, non-anthropomorphic language for describing LM behavior while highlighting both capabilities and limitations in their psychological realism.

## Method Summary
The method involves defining character trait measures as functions that map tuples of LM behavior (context and response pairs) to numerical scores representing specific traits like truthfulness, helpfulness, or coherence. The framework samples LM responses at temperature=0 (assuming deterministic behavior) and calculates distributions over trait scores to evaluate consistency and other properties. Experiments compare trait consistency across different model sizes, fine-tuning approaches, and prompting techniques using multiple datasets including Leap-of-Thought for logical coherence and custom-generated datasets for intention evaluation. The analysis examines whether traits are stationary (unchanged over interaction) or reflective (mirroring prior behavior), with statistical tests for independence and stationarity.

## Key Results
- Larger and fine-tuned models exhibit more consistent beliefs and intentions than smaller models
- Few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting significantly improve helpfulness trait scores
- Truthfulness can be stationary in some contexts but reflective in others, depending on context length
- The smallest models showed the lowest helpful and harmful intent scores, consistent with their weaker reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The behaviorist framework treats LM traits as measurable behavioral tendencies rather than internal states.
- Mechanism: By mapping sequences of LM inputs and outputs to scores, the framework operationalizes traits like truthfulness, helpfulness, and coherence as functions that can be consistently measured across models, fine-tuning, and prompting.
- Core assumption: Consistent behavioral patterns in LMs can be reliably quantified using the defined character trait measures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "formalises a behaviourist view of LM character traits: qualities such as truthfulness, sycophancy, or coherent beliefs and intentions, which may manifest as consistent patterns of behaviour."
  - [section 2] "we define a character trait measure as a function which maps tuples of LM behaviour to a score"
- Break condition: If LM responses become too stochastic or the operationalization of traits does not capture meaningful behavioral differences.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The consistency of exhibited traits varies with model size, fine-tuning, and prompting techniques.
- Mechanism: Larger models and fine-tuned models show more consistent beliefs and intentions because they have learned more robust patterns during training, and prompting techniques like few-shot or chain-of-thought improve trait consistency by providing structured context.
- Core assumption: Model size and training methods directly influence the stability of behavioral patterns in responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "larger and fine-tuned models exhibit more consistent beliefs and intentions, with traits like helpfulness improving significantly under few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting."
  - [section 4] "across the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, the smallest models had the lowest helpful and harmful intent scores, in accordance with their relative weakness at reasoning and adaptation."
- Break condition: If trait consistency plateaus or degrades with model size beyond a certain point, or if prompting techniques introduce bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Traits can be stationary or reflective depending on context and interaction length.
- Mechanism: Some traits remain consistent over an interaction (stationary) when the LM's behavior is independent of past context, while others mirror the LM's prior behavior (reflective) when context strongly influences responses.
- Core assumption: The independence of new context and LM responses from past interactions determines trait stationarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "traits such as truthfulness and harmfulness can be stationary, i.e., consistent over an interaction, in certain contexts, but may be reflective in different contexts."
  - [section 5] "Theorem 6 implies GPT-4's harmfulness is stationary on the Durbin (2024) data set."
- Break condition: If LM context conditioning changes significantly across different datasets or if in-context learning capabilities evolve unpredictably.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probability distributions over LM responses and character trait measures.
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on sampling LM responses and calculating distributions over trait scores to evaluate consistency.
  - Quick check question: If an LM outputs responses with p(r|c) and we sample multiple responses, how do we compute the distribution over a trait score?

- Concept: Statistical independence and stationarity in stochastic processes.
  - Why needed here: To determine whether traits are stationary or reflective, we need to assess if LM responses depend on past interactions.
  - Quick check question: If the probability of a new context c is independent of past contexts ct, what does this imply about the stationarity of character traits?

- Concept: Logical entailment and consistency in reasoning.
  - Why needed here: Evaluating logical coherence of LM beliefs requires understanding entailment relations between propositions.
  - Quick check question: If an LM believes both A and A → B, under what condition would its beliefs be considered logically coherent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input data sets (e.g., Leap-of-Thought, custom intention datasets)
  - Character trait measure functions mapping (context, response) tuples to scores
  - Sampling and distribution estimation pipeline
  - Analysis tools for consistency (mean, variance, MSD)
  - Visualization components for trait distributions

- Critical path:
  1. Load input data set and select model(s)
  2. Generate responses under controlled temperature
  3. Apply character trait measure to response tuples
  4. Compute distribution statistics (mean, variance)
  5. Compare across models, fine-tuning, prompting
  6. Analyze trends and stationarity/reflectivity

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Deterministic vs. stochastic response generation (temperature=0 for consistency)
  - Multiple-choice vs. open-ended response formats (affects semantic equivalence checks)
  - Sample size vs. computational cost (larger samples improve distribution estimates)
  - Custom dataset generation vs. using existing benchmarks (bias vs. control)

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in trait scores across samples (indicates inconsistency or poor operationalization)
  - Trait distributions that do not change with model size/fine-tuning (suggests framework insensitivity)
  - Reflective traits showing no dependence on context (implies independence assumption violated)
  - Stationarity failing when context independence assumption is broken

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Experiment 1: Measure anti-LGBTQ sentiment consistency across GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4
  2. Run Experiment 2: Evaluate logical coherence on Leap-of-Thought for a small set of models
  3. Implement Experiment 5: Test harmfulness stationarity using the adapted Durbin dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do language models exhibit consistent beliefs across diverse contexts beyond question-answering tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates beliefs through question-answering on the Leap-of-Thought dataset, acknowledging this provides a "narrow window" into LM beliefs and may not generalize to other contexts.
- Why unresolved: The study's behavioral operationalization of beliefs is limited to logical coherence in specific entailment scenarios, leaving open whether LMs maintain consistent beliefs in more varied or naturalistic settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing LM beliefs across multiple task types (e.g., creative writing, reasoning, factual recall) and measuring consistency across these domains would clarify the breadth of their belief systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different fine-tuning objectives (e.g., helpfulness vs. safety) interact and influence LM character traits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that traits like helpfulness and harmlessness may be "contradictory" and observe varying effects of fine-tuning on different models, but don't systematically test conflicting objectives.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows fine-tuning improves certain traits, it doesn't explore how optimizing for one trait (e.g., helpfulness) might degrade another (e.g., harmlessness) or create unintended behavioral patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments testing LMs fine-tuned for multiple, potentially conflicting objectives would reveal trade-offs and interaction effects between different character traits.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What mechanisms underlie the development of stationary vs. reflective character traits in language models during interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify stationary traits (consistent over interaction) and reflective traits (mirroring prior behavior), finding GPT-4 exhibits reflective truthfulness with longer contexts, but don't explain why this occurs.
- Why unresolved: The paper observes these patterns but doesn't investigate whether they stem from model architecture, training data, in-context learning capabilities, or other factors that determine trait dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing model activations and attention patterns during interactions, comparing different model architectures, and testing with varying context lengths would help identify the sources of stationary vs. reflective behavior.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on deterministic sampling (temperature=0) may not capture the stochastic nature of LM behavior in practical applications
- The semantic equivalence determination method for non-multiple-choice responses remains underspecified, potentially affecting trait score reliability
- The assumption of context independence for stationarity analysis may not hold for more advanced LMs with stronger in-context learning capabilities

## Confidence

- High confidence: The formalization of character traits as measurable behavioral tendencies is well-supported by the mathematical framework and empirical evidence showing clear differences across model sizes and fine-tuning approaches.
- Medium confidence: The stationarity and reflectivity distinctions are theoretically sound, but their practical applicability may vary depending on the specific LM architecture and dataset characteristics.
- Low confidence: The exact implementation details for some trait measures, particularly those involving semantic equivalence evaluation, could significantly impact reproducibility and comparative results.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the logical coherence experiment on Leap-of-Thought with a subset of models to verify the reported variance patterns and mean scores.
2. Test the harmfulness stationarity analysis using the adapted Durbin dataset across multiple runs to assess consistency of the findings.
3. Implement a controlled comparison of trait score distributions when varying the temperature parameter above 0 to understand the impact of stochasticity on the framework's measurements.
