# Balanced Edge Pruning for Graph Anomaly Detection with Noisy Labels

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.05934
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05934
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: REGAD framework outperforms existing methods on graph anomaly detection with noisy labels, achieving significant improvements in AUC and AUPR metrics across three real-world datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of graph anomaly detection in the presence of noisy labels, which is common in real-world scenarios. The authors propose REGAD, a reinforcement learning-based framework that iteratively prunes edges to mitigate the negative impact of noisy labels on anomaly detection performance. REGAD consists of a base detector that identifies noisy label candidates and a policy network that learns to prune edges around these candidates. The framework operates in a policy-in-the-loop manner, with the base detector providing feedback to guide the edge pruning process. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that REGAD outperforms existing methods under different noise ratios.

## Method Summary
REGAD is a two-stage framework that combines a base detector (Meta-GDN) with a reinforcement learning-based edge pruner. The base detector uses a 2-layer GCN to predict anomaly scores and generate confident sets (AS, NS) and noisy label candidates (NC). The edge pruner employs a policy network with 2-layer GCN to iteratively prune edges around candidates based on rewards from base detector performance. The policy-in-the-loop mechanism enables iterative refinement between the base detector and edge pruner, with the base detector's performance (AUC) serving as the reward signal for guiding edge pruning decisions.

## Key Results
- REGAD outperforms existing methods on three real-world datasets (Clothing, Computer, Photo) under different noise ratios
- The framework achieves significant improvements in AUC and AUPR metrics for graph anomaly detection
- Policy-in-the-loop mechanism effectively reduces the negative impact of noisy labels through iterative edge pruning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Edge pruning guided by reinforcement learning reduces the negative impact of noisy labels on graph anomaly detection.
- Mechanism: The policy network learns to selectively prune edges around nodes with noisy labels, preventing incorrect information from propagating through the graph structure.
- Core assumption: The base detector can reliably identify nodes with noisy labels and provide useful feedback for the edge pruner.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "REGAD contains two novel components. (i) A tailored policy network, which involves two-step actions to remove negative effect propagation step by step. (ii) A policy-in-the-loop mechanism to identify suitable edge removal strategies that control the propagation of noise on the graph..."
  - [section] "To control incorrect information transmission, we apply reinforcement learning to learn a policy πθ(a|s) to cut edges of candidates to manage noisy labels' influence."
  - [corpus] Weak. No directly relevant papers found in the neighbor corpus.
- Break condition: If the base detector cannot reliably identify noisy labels, the edge pruning strategy will be ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The policy-in-the-loop framework enables collaborative learning between the base detector and edge pruner, improving overall performance.
- Mechanism: The base detector provides feedback to guide the edge pruning process, while the edge pruner refines the graph structure to improve the base detector's performance.
- Core assumption: The base detector and edge pruner can effectively exchange information and mutually benefit from each other's improvements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The overall performance is evaluated by the cumulative rewards. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets under different anomaly ratios. The results indicate the superior performance of our proposed REGAD."
  - [section] "The policy-in-the-loop frame is depicted as a cyclic framework where the base detector and pruner interact, providing necessary feedback to refine the graph structure."
  - [corpus] Weak. No directly relevant papers found in the neighbor corpus.
- Break condition: If the feedback loop between the base detector and edge pruner becomes unstable or leads to suboptimal performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The tailored action and search space for the policy network enables efficient edge pruning while maintaining graph structure integrity.
- Mechanism: The policy network prioritizes suspicious edges for pruning, limiting the number of edges cut in each step to prevent over-pruning and preserve graph semantics.
- Core assumption: The policy network can effectively prioritize suspicious edges and balance the trade-off between noise reduction and graph structure preservation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We design a tailored action and search space to train a policy network to carefully prune edges step by step, where only a few suspicious edges are prioritized in each step."
  - [section] "The aim of the pruner is to learn a strategy to reshape the graph while keeping the semantic representation."
  - [corpus] Weak. No directly relevant papers found in the neighbor corpus.
- Break condition: If the policy network cannot effectively prioritize edges or maintain a balance between noise reduction and graph structure preservation.
