## Executive Summary
This paper introduces E-3DGS, a method that integrates exposure events with 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality 3D reconstruction using a single event camera. By capturing motion events during fast movement and exposure events during slow motion through a programmable aperture, the approach converts temporal intensity changes into grayscale images for detailed reconstruction. The framework operates in three modes: High-Quality (using exposure events), Fast (using motion events), and Balanced Hybrid (combining both). On synthetic data, exposure events significantly outperform motion events, achieving PSNR of 35.73 dB versus 17.29 dB. On the real-world EME-3D dataset, E-3DGS achieves 25.22 PSNR in Fast Mode and 33.92 PSNR in High-Quality Mode, outperforming both event-based NeRF and event-to-grayscale learning methods while maintaining faster rendering speeds (79.37 FPS).

## Method Summary
E-3DGS combines exposure and motion events captured through a programmable aperture camera to enable high-quality 3D reconstruction. The method operates in three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events for detailed grayscale images, Fast Reconstruction using motion events for dynamic scenes, and Balanced Hybrid combining both approaches. Exposure events are converted to grayscale images via temporal-to-intensity mapping, where pixel intensity is derived from event timestamps based on the transmittance curve. Motion events capture brightness changes during fast movement. The framework uses 3D Gaussian Splatting with combined motion and exposure event losses, trained for 10K-30K iterations depending on mode. Camera poses are estimated using COLMAP from the exposure-derived grayscale images.

## Key Results
- PSNR of 35.73 dB using exposure events vs 17.29 dB for motion events on synthetic data
- 25.22 PSNR in Fast Mode and 33.92 PSNR in High-Quality Mode on real EME-3D dataset
- Rendering speed of 79.37 FPS, outperforming event-based NeRF
- Effective under extreme lighting conditions where traditional cameras struggle with motion blur

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Exposure events can be converted into high-quality grayscale images via temporal-to-intensity mapping, enabling better 3D reconstruction than motion events alone.
- Mechanism: The camera's programmable aperture controls transmittance over time. Each pixel triggers an event when its accumulated brightness change exceeds a threshold. By recording the precise timestamp of each pixel's first event (IPE), the method maps temporal information to intensity via integration of the transmittance curve, producing a dense grayscale image.
- Core assumption: The brightness change rate is uniform or predictable across pixels so that the IPE timestamp linearly relates to scene intensity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "exposure events (generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower motion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization"
  - [section]: "we introduce a Transmittance Adjustment (TA) device, where the transmittance rate 𝑇 𝑅(𝑡) changes from 0 to 1... The intensity-proportional value 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑢) can be derived from the event time 𝑡∗(𝑢) as follows"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct match, but HDRGS and CRiM-GS in corpus show interest in handling dynamic range, which is related to exposure event benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining motion events (for dynamic scenes) and exposure events (for texture detail) in a hybrid loss function improves reconstruction robustness.
- Mechanism: Motion event loss ensures the predicted brightness changes align with asynchronous event streams, while exposure event loss uses dense grayscale supervision from the mapped exposure images. A weighted combination (λ=0.5 in hybrid mode) balances both constraints during training.
- Core assumption: The sparse motion event supervision and dense exposure image supervision are complementary and can be combined without conflicting gradients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "three operating modes... Balanced Hybrid optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events"
  - [section]: "𝐿 = 𝜆 · 𝐿evs,norm + ( 1 − 𝜆) · 𝐿img, where 𝜆 = 0.5 balances both for a compromise between speed and quality"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no explicit hybrid loss combinations in neighbors, but EGS-SLAM and MBA-SLAM imply fusion of modalities for robustness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using exposure events in high-quality mode bypasses the need for complex learning-based event-to-image networks, reducing computational overhead.
- Mechanism: The temporal-to-intensity mapping is a deterministic, physics-based conversion that directly yields high-quality grayscale images, avoiding the need for training and inference of deep networks like E2VID.
- Core assumption: The exposure event stream is sufficient to reconstruct a full-resolution grayscale image without requiring learned priors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our method achieves faster reconstruction... than event-based NeRF and is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data"
  - [section]: "the training process of E-3DGS does not rely on the complex computations required by the learning-based E2VID or SAM"
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbors like USP-Gaussian and EGS-SLAM focus on event processing, but not on replacing learning-based pipelines.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event camera model and brightness change detection
  - Why needed here: E-3DGS operates entirely on event streams; understanding how events encode intensity changes is fundamental to both motion and exposure event processing.
  - Quick check question: What does a positive event polarity indicate about the change in log intensity at that pixel?

- Concept: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation and differentiable rendering
  - Why needed here: E-3DGS extends 3DGS by adding event-based supervision; understanding the Gaussian splatting pipeline is essential for implementing the motion and exposure event losses.
  - Quick check question: How is the 2D covariance matrix computed from the 3D covariance and the camera projection for rendering?

- Concept: Temporal-to-intensity mapping and physics of event generation
  - Why needed here: This is the core innovation for converting exposure events into usable grayscale images; requires understanding of how event timestamps relate to intensity.
  - Quick check question: If the aperture transmittance function is linear, what is the mathematical relationship between the IPE timestamp and the pixel intensity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Event Camera with Transmittance Adjustment (TA) device -> Event Stream Recorder -> Temporal-to-Intensity Mapper -> COLMAP Pipeline -> 3DGS Core -> Loss Functions -> Rendering Engine

- Critical path:
  1. Capture event stream with TA device active/inactive
  2. Partition into motion and exposure events
  3. Map exposure events to grayscale images
  4. Run COLMAP on grayscale images to get camera poses and sparse point cloud
  5. Initialize 3D Gaussians from point cloud
  6. Optimize 3DGS with combined motion and exposure event losses
  7. Render final scene

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exposure vs. Motion: Exposure events give better texture but can't handle fast motion; motion events are fast but lack texture
  - Deterministic vs. Learned: Temporal mapping is deterministic and fast but relies on accurate transmittance control; learned methods like E2VID are more flexible but slower
  - Single sensor vs. Multi-sensor: Pure event sensor is cheaper and simpler but loses color; RGB+event fusion gives color but adds complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Motion event only mode: Blurry geometry, missing fine details, inconsistent backgrounds
  - Exposure event only mode: Poor handling of fast motion, potential ghosting if object moves during exposure window
  - Hybrid mode: If λ is poorly tuned, may get either noisy textures or blurry motion
  - Temporal mapping: If aperture is non-ideal, images may have banding or incorrect brightness

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run E-3DGS in Fast Reconstruction Mode on a synthetic dataset (like EventNeRF) to verify that motion events alone produce reasonable geometry without color
  2. Run in High-Quality Reconstruction Mode on a synthetic dataset to verify that exposure events produce sharper textures and higher PSNR than motion events
  3. Run in Balanced Hybrid Mode and sweep λ from 0 to 1 to find the optimal tradeoff point for a given motion speed scenario

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method scale to larger scenes and real-world environments beyond the current dataset limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "experiments were confined to smaller datasets, and the method's scalability to large-scale environments remains untested" and note this as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments are limited to smaller datasets (EME-3D with 9 sequences) and synthetic data, without testing on larger real-world environments or scenes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating the method's performance on large-scale outdoor scenes, urban environments, or extensive indoor spaces with multiple rooms/objects would provide evidence of scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific performance limitations and degradation modes when operating under extremely high event rates or saturation conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "we have not evaluated performance under extremely high event rates, where event camera saturation could degrade results, particularly in scenarios like large scenes under bright sunlight" and note this as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The current work does not include experiments or analysis of performance under high event rates or saturation conditions, leaving uncertainty about how the method behaves in these scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing with controlled high event rate scenarios, including bright sunlight conditions and fast motion, would reveal specific failure modes and performance degradation patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can color information be effectively integrated into the E-3DGS framework while maintaining its efficiency advantages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "our method currently reconstructs grayscale scenes, lacking color information inherent in traditional RGB-based approaches" and identify this as a limitation, noting future work will explore "the integration of color information, potentially by leveraging color event cameras."
- Why unresolved: The current framework only produces grayscale reconstructions, and while color event cameras exist, there is no established method for efficiently integrating color information into the E-3DGS pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working implementation that successfully reconstructs colored 3D scenes using color event cameras while maintaining or improving upon the current method's efficiency would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- Hardware dependency: The method relies on a programmable aperture device (Transmittance Adjustment) that is not fully specified, creating reproducibility challenges
- Limited real-world evaluation: Experiments are primarily on synthetic data and the EME-3D dataset (9 sequences), with unclear generalization to diverse scenarios
- No color reconstruction: The framework produces grayscale outputs only, lacking color information inherent in traditional RGB-based approaches

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Temporal-to-intensity mapping): Medium - The physics is sound but hardware dependencies are unclear
- Mechanism 2 (Hybrid loss combination): Medium - Theoretical basis is reasonable but empirical validation is limited
- Mechanism 3 (Deterministic vs learned conversion): High - The computational advantage is clearly demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. Test the temporal-to-intensity mapping on synthetic data with controlled non-linear brightness changes to verify robustness beyond uniform conditions
2. Evaluate reconstruction quality when objects move at varying speeds during the exposure window to assess ghosting artifacts
3. Compare E-3DGS performance against E2VID-based approaches on datasets with extreme lighting variations to validate the claimed computational efficiency benefits
