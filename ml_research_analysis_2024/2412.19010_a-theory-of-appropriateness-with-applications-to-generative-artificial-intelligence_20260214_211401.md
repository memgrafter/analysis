# A theory of appropriateness with applications to generative artificial intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.19010
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19010
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents a computational model of social appropriateness based on predictive pattern completion, proposing decentralized AI systems where communities can customize their AI's concept of appropriateness

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theory of appropriateness that explains how humans navigate complex social situations through context-dependent, arbitrary, automatic, dynamic, and sanctioning decision-making. The authors propose that individuals make decisions by answering questions about the situation, their identity, and appropriate behavior through predictive pattern completion. The theory positions appropriateness as a conflict resolution technology that enables collective flourishing by coordinating expectations and deterring antisocial behavior. For AI applications, the paper advocates for a decentralized ecosystem where different communities can customize their AI's concept of appropriateness, addressing the limitations of current AI systems that often lack critical context and produce inappropriate responses.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a theoretical framework for appropriateness based on predictive pattern completion, where individuals automatically generate appropriate responses by recognizing patterns in social situations. The authors draw on philosophical and sociological traditions (Dewey, Durkheim, Goffman) to argue that appropriateness emerges from collective experience and sanctions. The computational model involves answering three key questions: what kind of situation is this, who am I, and what should I do. For AI applications, the proposed approach involves creating a decentralized ecosystem where different communities can customize their AI's concept of appropriateness through local context and norms, rather than relying on centralized, one-size-fits-all solutions.

## Key Results
- Proposes a computational model of appropriateness based on predictive pattern completion that captures key properties: context-dependence, arbitrariness, automaticity, dynamism, and sanctioning
- Frames appropriateness as a conflict resolution technology that enables collective flourishing through coordinated expectations and deterrence of antisocial behavior
- Suggests a decentralized AI ecosystem where communities can customize their AI's concept of appropriateness, addressing limitations of current systems that lack critical context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The theory works because it captures the fundamental way humans navigate social complexity through automatic pattern recognition and collective experience. Appropriateness emerges from the dynamic interplay between individual identity, situational context, and collective norms. The model explains why appropriateness appears arbitrary yet is deeply structured by cultural experience, and why it operates largely automatically while remaining sensitive to subtle contextual cues. For AI, the decentralized approach works because it acknowledges that appropriateness is inherently local and contextual, making centralized solutions fundamentally limited in their ability to capture the nuance and dynamism of real-world social situations.

## Foundational Learning
**Predictive Pattern Completion**: The cognitive mechanism underlying appropriateness judgments, where individuals automatically generate responses by recognizing familiar patterns in social situations. Needed because it explains the automatic, context-dependent nature of appropriateness decisions. Quick check: Can this mechanism be modeled computationally with sufficient accuracy?

**Decentralized Appropriateness**: The proposal that different communities should have agency over their AI's concept of appropriateness rather than relying on centralized standards. Needed because appropriateness is inherently contextual and varies across cultures. Quick check: How can we ensure consistency and prevent harmful norms in a decentralized system?

**Collective Sanctioning**: The role of social consequences in maintaining appropriate behavior and coordinating expectations. Needed because it explains how appropriateness norms are enforced and evolve over time. Quick check: What mechanisms can replicate collective sanctioning in AI systems?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Communities -> Local Appropriateness Standards -> AI Customization -> Dynamic Updates -> Sanction Mechanisms
**Critical Path**: Situation recognition → Identity assessment → Pattern matching → Appropriate response generation → Sanction application
**Design Tradeoffs**: Decentralized control (greater contextual accuracy) vs. centralized coordination (consistency and safety); computational complexity vs. real-time responsiveness; cultural specificity vs. universal standards
**Failure Signatures**: Inappropriate responses in novel situations; cultural insensitivity; reinforcement of harmful norms; computational inefficiency; inability to handle conflicting appropriateness standards
**First Experiments**: 1) Cross-cultural validation of predictive pattern completion model; 2) Prototype implementation of decentralized appropriateness system; 3) Evaluation of computational efficiency compared to centralized approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions beyond those related to implementation challenges and the need for empirical validation across diverse contexts.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework lacks empirical validation across diverse cultural contexts and relies heavily on Western philosophical traditions
- Does not fully address how to handle situations where different communities have irreconcilable concepts of appropriateness
- Implementation challenges include computational costs and mechanisms for resolving conflicts between competing appropriateness standards

## Confidence
Medium confidence in the predictive pattern completion model's ability to capture appropriateness judgments, as the framework is well-articulated but lacks empirical validation. Medium confidence in the conflict resolution framing of appropriateness, supported by sociological reasoning but requiring further testing. Medium confidence in the proposed decentralized AI ecosystem, which is logically coherent but faces significant implementation challenges not fully addressed in the paper.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural studies to test whether the predictive pattern completion model accurately captures appropriateness judgments across different societies and contexts
2. Implement a prototype of the proposed decentralized appropriateness system and evaluate its computational efficiency and scalability compared to centralized approaches
3. Systematically evaluate potential harms from allowing communities to customize AI appropriateness standards, particularly regarding reinforcement of harmful norms or creation of echo chambers
