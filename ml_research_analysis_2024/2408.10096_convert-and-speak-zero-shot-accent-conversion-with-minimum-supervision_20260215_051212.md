# Convert and Speak: Zero-shot Accent Conversion with Minimum Supervision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.10096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10096
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: Achieves state-of-the-art accent conversion with 69.3% MOS-Accent on VCTK and 74.3% on L1-L2 ARCTIC using only 15 minutes of weakly parallel data

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a two-stage generative framework for accent conversion that operates on semantic token level, converting pronunciation patterns while preserving speaker identity and generating speech with target accent prosody. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in accent similarity, speech quality, and speaker maintenance using only 15 minutes of weakly parallel data without requiring text transcriptions. Experiments show the method significantly outperforms baseline methods on both VCTK and L1-L2 ARCTIC test sets. The approach also demonstrates adaptability to other low-resource accents like Chinese-English and Korean-English with minimal parallel data.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of two main components: a conversion module and a speaking module. The conversion module transforms semantic tokens extracted from source accent speech into target accent semantic tokens using a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model pre-trained with token in-filling on target accent data, then fine-tuned with 15 minutes of weakly parallel data. The speaking module generates target accent speech from the converted semantic tokens using a single-stage autoregressive generative model based on TF-Codec with group quantization. The decoupling design enables the speaking module to train on massive amounts of target accent speech without parallel data constraints, while the pre-training significantly reduces the supervision required for the conversion module.

## Key Results
- Achieves 69.3% MOS-Accent on VCTK test set and 74.3% on L1-L2 ARCTIC test set
- Reduces required parallel data from 50 to 15 minutes with minimal performance degradation
- Outperforms baseline methods in accent similarity, speech quality, and speaker maintenance
- Demonstrates adaptability to Chinese-English and Korean-English accent conversion with minimal parallel data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decoupling accent conversion from speech generation allows independent optimization of each stage. The framework separates semantic token conversion from acoustic synthesis, enabling the speaking module to train on large amounts of target accent speech without parallel data constraints. Semantic tokens extracted by HuBERT serve as a bridge between source and target accents.

### Mechanism 2
Pre-training the conversion module with target accent data reduces the need for parallel supervision. A BART/T5-style pre-training task is used to learn the probability space of semantic tokens in the target accent domain, enabling conversion with minimal parallel data.

### Mechanism 3
Single-stage AR generative model reduces complexity while maintaining quality. Instead of multi-stage generation with RVQ, the framework uses TF-Codec with group quantization and a single-stage AR model to generate all VQs simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vector quantization and its role in speech codecs**: The framework relies on TF-Codec's group quantization to enable single-stage generation of acoustic codes. Quick check: How does group quantization differ from residual vector quantization in terms of generation complexity?

- **Autoregressive vs non-autoregressive generation**: The framework uses a single-stage autoregressive approach for better quality, contrasting with multi-stage NAR/AR hybrids. Quick check: What are the trade-offs between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation in terms of quality and latency?

- **Semantic tokenization of speech using self-supervised models**: HuBERT tokens serve as the bridge between source and target accents, requiring understanding of how they capture linguistic content. Quick check: How do HuBERT tokens differ from traditional phoneme representations in terms of accent invariance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Source speech → HuBERT tokens → Conversion module → Target accent tokens → Speech generative model → Target accent speech
- **Critical path**: Source speech flows through HuBERT-based semantic tokenization, then the conversion module, followed by TF-Codec-based acoustic tokenization, and finally the single-stage AR generative model
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-stage vs multi-stage generation (complexity vs quality), pre-training vs direct training (data efficiency vs model complexity)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor accent conversion (LCSR metrics low), degraded speech quality (MOS-Naturalness drops), speaker identity loss (SPK similarity decreases)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate HuBERT token accent invariance by comparing LCSR between source and target accent tokens
  2. Test conversion quality with varying amounts of parallel data (15min vs 30min vs 50min) to verify pre-training effectiveness
  3. Compare single-stage vs multi-stage generation quality and complexity using TF-Codec vs Encodec

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How robust is the conversion module when applied to highly divergent accent pairs beyond Indian-English to American-English? The authors demonstrate the framework works for Chinese-English and Korean-English to American-English conversion, but only test with 15 minutes of parallel data. The paper does not provide extensive testing across multiple accent pairs or examine failure cases with more divergent phonetic systems.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between the amount of parallel data for fine-tuning versus the pre-training data size for achieving best conversion quality? The authors reduce parallel data from 50 to 15 minutes with minimal performance degradation, but do not explore the full data efficiency curve or optimal training ratios. The paper only tests three discrete data amounts without exploring the continuous relationship between pre-training data size and parallel data requirements.

### Open Question 3
How does the single-stage TF-Codec generative model compare to traditional multi-stage approaches on other speech synthesis tasks beyond accent conversion? The authors demonstrate their single-stage model achieves better quality and lower latency than EnCodec-based multi-stage models specifically for accent conversion, but do not test the single-stage approach on other speech synthesis benchmarks or tasks to establish general superiority.

## Limitations

- The decoupling approach assumes HuBERT semantic tokens are truly accent-agnostic, but HuBERT was trained on multi-accent data and may retain accent-specific features
- The effectiveness of the 15-minute weakly parallel data requirement is demonstrated only for Indian-English to General American-English conversion, with limited validation on other accent pairs
- The single-stage AR generative model may not capture the same fine-grained prosodic details that multi-stage approaches with residual vector quantization can achieve
- The framework's generalization to highly distinct accent pairs (e.g., tonal languages) remains unproven

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The framework's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal parallel data (verified by MOS-Accent scores of 69.3% on VCTK and 74.3% on L1-L2 ARCTIC)
- **Medium confidence**: The decoupling mechanism's effectiveness across different accent pairs (strong evidence for Indian-English to General American-English, limited evidence for Chinese-English and Korean-English)
- **Medium confidence**: The pre-training approach's ability to reduce supervision requirements (demonstrated for one accent pair but not systematically evaluated across different amounts of parallel data)
- **Medium confidence**: The single-stage AR model's quality vs complexity trade-off (complexity reduction is quantified, but quality comparisons with multi-stage approaches are limited)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on parallel data quantity**: Systematically evaluate conversion quality with 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes of weakly parallel data to quantify the minimum supervision threshold and validate the pre-training effectiveness claim.

2. **Cross-accent generalization test**: Apply the framework to a more challenging accent conversion task (e.g., Mandarin-English or Arabic-English) and evaluate whether the 15-minute parallel data requirement holds.

3. **Quality comparison with multi-stage generation**: Implement a multi-stage AR generation approach using the same TF-Codec backbone but with residual vector quantization, then compare MOS-Naturalness, speaker similarity, and accent similarity scores.
