# Explaining the Unexplained: Revealing Hidden Correlations for Better Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01365
- Authors: Wen-Dong Jiang; Chih-Yung Chang; Show-Jane Yen; Diptendu Sinha Roy
- Reference count: 8
- One-line primary result: RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability metrics, achieving Jaccard coefficient of 0.83 vs. 0.77 and R² of 0.84 vs. 0.77

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), a method that addresses the limitations of traditional Shapley Value-based interpretability by decoupling feature importance into individual contributions and correlation-based interactions. RealExp uses feature similarity computations to precisely quantify both individual feature contributions and their interactions, leading to more reliable explanations. The method employs perturbation-based surrogate models with an ensemble tree approach, avoiding issues associated with linear proxy models. Experiments on image classification and text sentiment analysis tasks show that RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability metrics.

## Method Summary
RealExp improves interpretability by decomposing Shapley Value into independent (∅ᵢᵈᵉᵖ) and interaction (∅ᵢᵐᵃʳᵍ) components, using feature similarity to weight and reduce the impact of correlated features. The method employs fixed-ratio perturbation (up to 30%) to generate stable samples, avoiding the variance issues of random or Monte Carlo sampling. An ensemble tree model serves as the surrogate model, capturing non-linear relationships between features. Feature importance scores are calculated using a novel formula that accounts for both individual contributions and correlations, then visualized as heatmaps. The approach is evaluated on image and text datasets using metrics including Jaccard coefficient, R², and expert alignment scores measured via Kendall's τ coefficient.

## Key Results
- RealExp achieves Jaccard coefficient of 0.83 vs. 0.77 for existing methods
- RealExp achieves R² of 0.84 vs. 0.77 for existing methods
- RealExp shows improved expert alignment scores when combining feature importance paths and accuracy using Kendall's τ coefficient

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RealExp improves interpretability by decoupling Shapley Value into independent and interaction components.
- Mechanism: The method separates the Shapley Value into an independent contribution (∅ᵢᵈᵉᵖ) and an interaction contribution (∅ᵢᵐᵃʳᵍ), using feature similarity to weight and reduce the impact of correlated features.
- Core assumption: Feature correlations can be quantified and used to adjust the marginal contribution of features in the Shapley Value calculation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), a method that decouples Shapley Value into individual feature importance and feature correlation importance to enhance interpretability."
  - [section 3.2] "Specifically, the Shapley Value ∅ᵢ of each feature is decomposed into two components: ∅ᵢ = ∅ᵢᵈᵉᵖ + ∅ᵢᵐᵃʳᵍ."
- Break condition: If feature similarity metrics are unreliable or if the model's decision boundary does not depend on correlated features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RealExp achieves more stable explanations than perturbation-based methods by using a fixed proportion for perturbation generation.
- Mechanism: Instead of random or Monte Carlo sampling, RealExp uses a fixed ratio (up to 30%) to generate perturbed images, reducing variance in the explanation results.
- Core assumption: Fixed proportion perturbation introduces less variance than random or Monte Carlo sampling methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3.1] "RealExp adopts a fixed ratio to generate perturbation samples, effectively reducing instability."
  - [section 3.3.1] "Comparison of Variances, it can be observed that: 𝑉𝑎𝑟_Fixed < 𝑉𝑎𝑟_Random < 𝑉𝑎𝑟_Monte Carlo."
- Break condition: If the fixed proportion does not adequately explore the feature space or if the model is highly sensitive to small perturbations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RealExp improves alignment with expert understanding by combining feature importance paths and accuracy using Kendall's τ coefficient.
- Mechanism: The method evaluates the consistency between the model's decision-making path and expert reasoning by calculating Kendall's τ coefficient for the top-ranked features.
- Core assumption: Expert annotations of feature importance can be meaningfully compared to model-generated importance scores using rank correlation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "To quantify the consistency between the model's and the expert's feature importance rankings, here are Consistency Evaluation Steps: First is Matching Count Calculation: Compare the overlap between 𝒰 and 𝒦..."
  - [section 4] "For Ranking Consistency Calculation: For all blocks in ℋ, calculate Kendall's τ coefficient to evaluate ranking consistency..."
- Break condition: If expert annotations are inconsistent or if the model's decision path is inherently non-linear and cannot be captured by rank correlation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shapley Value and its limitations in the presence of feature correlations.
  - Why needed here: Understanding the limitations of Shapley Value is crucial for appreciating why RealExp's decomposition approach is necessary.
  - Quick check question: Why does Shapley Value underestimate the importance of features when they are correlated?

- Concept: Feature similarity and its role in adjusting marginal contributions.
  - Why needed here: Feature similarity is the core mechanism by which RealExp reduces the impact of correlated features on the explanation.
  - Quick check question: How does the similarity between features affect their marginal contribution in the RealExp calculation?

- Concept: Ensemble tree models as interpretable surrogates.
  - Why needed here: RealExp uses ensemble tree models to fit the perturbed data and calculate feature importance, so understanding their properties is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why does RealExp use ensemble tree models instead of linear regression for the surrogate model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Image → Segmentation → Perturbation (fixed ratio) → Model Prediction → Similarity Adjustment → Ensemble Tree Training → RealExp Calculation → Visualization

- Critical path:
  Image → Segmentation → Perturbation (fixed ratio) → Model Prediction → Similarity Adjustment → Ensemble Tree Training → RealExp Calculation → Visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed proportion perturbation vs. random sampling: Stability vs. coverage of feature space
  - Ensemble trees vs. linear models: Capturing non-linear relationships vs. computational efficiency
  - Kendall's τ vs. other correlation metrics: Interpretability vs. sensitivity to ranking differences

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in explanations: Fixed proportion perturbation not appropriate for the data
  - Low ℋ-score and M-score: Ensemble tree model not capturing important features or poor feature similarity metric
  - Computational inefficiency: Too many perturbation samples or complex ensemble tree structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare variance of explanations using fixed proportion vs. random sampling on a simple image dataset
  2. Evaluate ℋ-score and M-score of RealExp vs. LIME on a text sentiment analysis task with known feature importance
  3. Test sensitivity of RealExp to different feature similarity metrics on a dataset with varying degrees of feature correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the RealExp method perform on multimodal data where features are both numerical and categorical, such as tabular data with mixed feature types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses RealExp's application to image and text data, but does not explicitly address its performance on multimodal or tabular datasets with mixed feature types.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on unstructured data (images and text), leaving the applicability to structured datasets unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing RealExp's performance on mixed-feature tabular datasets against traditional interpretability methods like SHAP or LIME.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational complexity of RealExp compared to other interpretability methods like SHAP or LIME, especially when scaling to large datasets or high-dimensional features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that RealExp uses fixed-ratio perturbation and ensemble tree models, which may reduce computational overhead compared to Monte Carlo sampling. However, the computational complexity is not quantified.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests RealExp is more efficient, no direct comparison of runtime or computational cost is provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of RealExp's time and space complexity, including benchmark comparisons with other methods on large-scale datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does RealExp handle feature interactions in highly correlated datasets, and does it outperform methods like Kernel-SHAP in such scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces RealExp to address feature correlation issues by decoupling Shapley Values into independent and interaction contributions. However, it does not provide direct comparisons with Kernel-SHAP on highly correlated datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper claims RealExp improves interpretability by considering feature interactions, but empirical evidence in high-correlation scenarios is lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets with known feature correlations, comparing RealExp's performance against Kernel-SHAP and other methods in terms of interpretability and accuracy.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can RealExp be extended to explain models with non-differentiable components, such as decision trees or random forests, without relying on surrogate models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses RealExp as a surrogate model explainer, but does not explore its direct application to interpretable models like decision trees.
- Why unresolved: The focus is on black-box models, leaving the potential for direct interpretability of inherently interpretable models unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of RealExp's application to decision trees or random forests, comparing its explanations to the models' inherent interpretability.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies heavily on synthetic datasets (Animal-10 and Animal-151) with controlled conditions, which may not generalize to real-world scenarios with more complex feature interactions.
- The fixed 30% perturbation ratio, while shown to reduce variance, may not be optimal across all model architectures or data types.
- The paper does not address computational efficiency comparisons with baseline methods, leaving open questions about scalability for large datasets or real-time applications.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mathematical decomposition of Shapley Value into independent and interaction components is well-founded and theoretically sound. The use of ensemble trees as surrogate models is a proven approach in interpretable machine learning.
- **Medium Confidence**: The experimental results showing improvements in Jaccard coefficient, R², and expert alignment scores are compelling but limited to specific datasets and model architectures. The generalizability to other domains remains to be proven.
- **Low Confidence**: The novel evaluation metric combining expert annotations with Kendall's τ coefficient, while innovative, lacks extensive validation across different domains and may be sensitive to annotator bias.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Apply RealExp to a medical imaging dataset (e.g., chest X-rays or retinal scans) where feature correlations are known to be complex and evaluate whether the decomposition approach maintains interpretability improvements.

2. **Robustness Analysis**: Conduct a systematic study of RealExp's performance across different perturbation ratios (10%, 20%, 40%, 50%) to determine if the 30% fixed ratio is truly optimal or if adaptive ratios would perform better.

3. **Computational Benchmarking**: Measure and compare the computational time and memory requirements of RealExp against baseline methods (LIME, SHAP) on increasingly large datasets to establish practical scalability limits.
