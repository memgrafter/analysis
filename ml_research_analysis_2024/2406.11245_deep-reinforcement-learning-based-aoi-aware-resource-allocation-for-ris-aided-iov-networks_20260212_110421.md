# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for RIS-Aided IoV Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.11245
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11245
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SAC algorithm outperforms DDPG, PPO, TD3 with 33.2% improvement in V2V payload transmission success rate

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based solution for resource allocation in RIS-aided Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, focusing on minimizing the Age of Information (AoI) for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links while maximizing payload transmission success for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. The authors formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and employ the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to jointly optimize vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, cumulative reward, and overall system performance compared to traditional methods and other DRL algorithms.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses SAC to jointly optimize channel assignment, power control, and RIS phase-shift matrix in a centralized manner with the base station (BS) as the agent. The algorithm operates in an environment with vehicles moving at 10-15 m/s on a 450x650 m road network, with V2I links using fixed power and V2V links reusing spectrum. The SAC algorithm employs an actor network and two critic networks with experience replay and temperature parameter for entropy regularization, trained over 1000 episodes with 100 steps per episode.

## Key Results
- SAC achieves 33.2% improvement in V2V payload transmission success rate compared to DDPG
- SAC shows 24.04% improvement in V2I information transmission rate
- Superior convergence speed and cumulative reward compared to DDPG, PPO, and TD3 baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SAC outperforms DDPG, PPO, and TD3 in convergence speed and cumulative reward because of its entropy regularization and dual Q-network structure
- Mechanism: Entropy regularization encourages exploration by penalizing low-entropy policies, helping the agent explore high-dimensional action spaces more effectively. The dual Q-networks reduce overestimation bias by taking the minimum of two Q-value estimates
- Core assumption: The high-dimensional state and action spaces in the RIS-aided IoV network require robust exploration and stable value estimation to converge quickly
- Evidence anchors:
  - The SAC algorithm demonstrates superior performance in terms of convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance, and payload transmission probability
  - SAC is particularly effective for complex RL tasks due to its policy entropy regularization, experience replay, and dual Q-networks, which enhance stability, sample efficiency, and exploration
- Break condition: If the state or action spaces become too sparse or deterministic, the entropy term might hinder convergence rather than help

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint optimization of vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control improves both V2I AoI and V2V payload transmission success rate compared to schemes that optimize them separately
- Mechanism: By treating the BS as a central agent that controls both the channel allocation, power control, and RIS phase-shift matrix, the algorithm can coordinate interference management and channel enhancement simultaneously, leading to better overall performance
- Core assumption: The BS has sufficient computational resources and real-time channel state information to make optimal joint decisions
- Evidence anchors:
  - The paper proposes a solution where the BS takes on the responsibility of allocating channel resources, determining transmission power for all vehicle users, and deciding the RIS phase-shift matrix
  - The optimization objective involves vehicle resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control based on AoI sensing, and the BS acts as an agent that determines the vehicle's channel assignment, power control, and RIS phase-shift matrix
- Break condition: If the computational delay at the BS becomes significant compared to the channel coherence time, the joint optimization might not be feasible in real-time

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The AoI-aware reward function design effectively balances the trade-off between V2I AoI minimization and V2V payload transmission success rate
- Mechanism: The reward function is a weighted sum of the negative average V2I AoI and the negative average V2V payload delivery ratio. By adjusting the weights, the algorithm can prioritize one objective over the other as needed
- Core assumption: The weights in the reward function can be set to reflect the relative importance of V2I and V2V performance in the specific application scenario
- Evidence anchors:
  - The paper states that the reward at slot n is set to a weighted combination of the negative average V2I AoI and the negative average V2V payload delivery ratio
  - The paper describes the reward function design in detail, explaining how it balances the two objectives
- Break condition: If the weights are set incorrectly, the algorithm might converge to a suboptimal policy that overly favors one objective at the expense of the other

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: The problem of joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control is formulated as an MDP to enable the use of reinforcement learning algorithms
  - Quick check question: What are the four components of an MDP?

- Concept: Age of Information (AoI)
  - Why needed here: AoI is used as a metric to quantify the freshness of information in the V2I links, which is one of the optimization objectives
  - Quick check question: How is AoI defined in the context of this paper?

- Concept: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)
  - Why needed here: RIS is used to enhance the communication performance by reflecting and focusing signals, which is a key component of the system model
  - Quick check question: What is the role of RIS in the proposed system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environment -> Agent (BS) -> State -> Action -> Reward
- Critical path:
  1. The environment generates the current state based on the network conditions
  2. The agent observes the state and selects an action based on the current policy
  3. The environment executes the action and generates the next state and reward
  4. The agent updates its policy based on the observed transition and reward
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized vs. decentralized control: The paper opts for a centralized approach with the BS as the agent, which simplifies coordination but may introduce scalability issues
  - Exploration vs. exploitation: The SAC algorithm balances exploration and exploitation through entropy regularization, which is crucial for high-dimensional action spaces
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence: If the algorithm fails to converge, it might be due to insufficient exploration, incorrect reward scaling, or high computational complexity
  - Suboptimal performance: If the algorithm converges but performs poorly, it might be due to incorrect state representation, action space discretization, or reward function design
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the convergence speed and cumulative reward of SAC with DDPG, PPO, and TD3 on a simplified version of the problem
  2. Vary the weight coefficients in the reward function to study their impact on the trade-off between V2I AoI and V2V payload delivery
  3. Test the algorithm's performance under different mobility patterns and channel conditions to assess its robustness

- The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content

## Limitations
- The simulation uses a relatively small-scale network that may not capture full complexity of real-world IoV deployments
- Neural network architecture details beyond hidden layer size are not specified
- Exact implementation of AoI and payload transmission probability calculations is not fully detailed

## Confidence
- High confidence in SAC algorithm's superior performance compared to DDPG, PPO, TD3
- Medium confidence in entropy regularization and dual Q-networks driving performance gains
- Medium confidence in joint optimization approach's benefits
- Low confidence in generalizability to larger, more complex IoV networks

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm performance on larger-scale network with more vehicles and varying mobility patterns to assess scalability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of entropy regularization and dual Q-networks to overall performance
3. Implement system on hardware testbed or high-fidelity simulator to validate simulation results under more realistic conditions
