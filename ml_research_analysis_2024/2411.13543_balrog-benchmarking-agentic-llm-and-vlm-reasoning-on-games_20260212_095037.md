- BALROG reveals significant "knowing-doing" gap in current agentic models across six diverse game environments

## Executive Summary
BALROG introduces a comprehensive benchmark and framework to evaluate the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) on challenging, long-horizon reinforcement learning games. The benchmark aggregates six diverse environments—BabyAI, Crafter, TextWorld, Baba Is AI, MiniHack, and NetHack—spanning tasks from seconds to years to master. BALROG employs fine-grained metrics to measure model performance and supports both language-only and vision-language observation modalities. Extensive evaluations reveal that while current models achieve partial success on simpler tasks, they struggle significantly with more challenging environments, particularly in vision-based decision-making and long-term planning.

## Method Summary
BALROG aggregates six diverse reinforcement learning environments into a unified benchmark framework. The environments range from BabyAI (requiring ~3 hours for humans) to NetHack (requiring ~10 years for human mastery). The framework supports both language-only and vision-language observation modalities, with agents receiving observations and returning actions via text or image inputs. Performance is measured using fine-grained metrics that capture task completion, efficiency, and robustness. The evaluation protocol employs zero-shot prompting across all models, with 100 trials per task to ensure statistical significance. The framework includes a standardized API for model integration and result aggregation.

## Key Results
- Current models achieve partial success on simpler BALROG tasks but struggle significantly with challenging environments
- Vision-based decision-making remains a critical bottleneck for model performance
- Models exhibit a pronounced "knowing-doing" gap, failing to effectively apply their knowledge in practice
- Zero-shot prompting yields limited success, highlighting the need for stronger adaptation methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BALROG works by providing a standardized evaluation framework that captures the complexity of real-world decision-making scenarios through game environments. The benchmark isolates key challenges in agentic reasoning including long-horizon planning, multimodal perception, and action selection under uncertainty. By aggregating diverse environments, BALROG exposes models to a wide range of reasoning challenges that cannot be addressed through single-domain approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals: why needed to understand agent-environment interaction; quick check: can identify states, actions, rewards
- Multimodal learning: why needed for vision-language integration; quick check: can explain cross-modal attention
- Zero-shot prompting: why needed for evaluation methodology; quick check: can describe prompt engineering techniques
- Long-horizon planning: why needed for understanding temporal credit assignment; quick check: can explain temporal difference learning
- Agentic reasoning: why needed for autonomous decision-making; quick check: can distinguish reactive vs. deliberative agents

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Observation -> Perception -> Reasoning -> Action Selection -> Environment

Critical path: The reasoning module is the critical path, as it determines how observations are interpreted and actions are selected. Performance bottlenecks typically occur here due to limitations in planning and knowledge application.

Design tradeoffs: BALROG trades evaluation simplicity for comprehensive coverage by using zero-shot prompting rather than fine-tuning, which may underestimate model capabilities but provides more standardized comparisons.

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include catastrophic forgetting across environment transitions, inability to generalize from language to visual modalities, and poor long-term planning in complex state spaces.

First experiments:
1. Run a single environment (e.g., BabyAI) with one model to verify framework functionality
2. Test observation modality switching to ensure seamless language-vision integration
3. Evaluate model performance on the simplest task to establish baseline capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark aggregation approach does not specify relative weighting of different environments in overall performance metrics
- Zero-shot evaluation methodology may underestimate model capabilities when adaptation is possible
- Vision-language evaluations are limited to subset of models supporting visual input, potentially biasing comparisons

## Confidence

**Confidence labels:**
- BALROG benchmark design and implementation: **High**
- Claims about current model limitations on long-horizon tasks: **Medium**
- Generalizability of findings to other agentic scenarios: **Low**

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative contribution of each environment to overall benchmark performance
2. Evaluate models with fine-tuning on BALROG environments to establish upper bounds on performance
3. Implement cross-validation across different prompting strategies to assess sensitivity of results to evaluation methodology
