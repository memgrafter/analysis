# Use of topical and temporal profiles and their hybridisation for content-based recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10607
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10607
- Reference count: 20
- One-line primary result: Temporal-topical hybrid profiles significantly outperform baselines in publication venue recommendation

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how incorporating topical and temporal dimensions into user and item profiles can improve content-based recommender systems. The authors propose two methods to hybridize these dimensions: first discovering topics and then splitting them into temporal units, and vice versa. Experiments on a publication venue recommendation dataset show that the latter approach (temporal-topical) significantly outperforms baselines and other profile construction methods. The best results are achieved with 110 topics and a specific decay function, demonstrating that tailoring topic discovery to temporal partitions enhances recommendation quality.

## Method Summary
The study builds user and item profiles using term-based, topic-based, and temporal-based methods on the PMSC-UGR dataset containing 1,002 journals and 276,679 papers (2007-2015) for training. Profile construction methods include monolithic (single profile), atomic (one profile per document), topical (LDA-based topic modeling), temporal (decay-based time weighting), and hybrid approaches combining topical and temporal dimensions. The Lucene-based IR system with Language Model and Jelinek-Mercer smoothing ranks journal profiles, and performance is evaluated using R@1, R@5, and MRR@40 metrics.

## Key Results
- Temporal-topical hybrid profiles outperform all other profile construction methods
- The doubled squared root decay function performs better than linear decay for temporal profiles
- Optimal performance achieved with 110 topics using the temporal-topical approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Topical and temporal hybrid profiles improve content-based recommendations by capturing both subject matter and time-varying interests. LDA-based topical clustering identifies subject-specific subprofiles, while temporal partitioning ensures subprofiles reflect the evolution of topics over time. Hybrid profiles built by combining these dimensions provide more homogeneous and interpretable representations.

### Mechanism 2
Using decay functions to penalize older documents within subprofiles enhances recommendation quality by prioritizing recent content. Decay functions adjust relevance scores based on temporal distance from a reference point, thereby reducing the influence of outdated information.

### Mechanism 3
Temporal-topical hybrid profiles outperform topical-temporal ones because local topic discovery in each time partition tailors the model to the content of that period. Applying LDA separately within each temporal partition captures period-specific topics, while topical-temporal applies global topics to all periods, which may not fit each partition well.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling
  - Why needed here: LDA is used to discover latent topics in document collections, forming the basis for topical subprofiles
  - Quick check question: What does LDA output for each document, and how is it used to assign documents to topics?

- Concept: Decay functions for temporal weighting
  - Why needed here: Decay functions adjust the influence of older documents based on recency, which is critical for temporal profiles
  - Quick check question: How does the doubled squared root decay function differ from the linear one in penalizing older documents?

- Concept: Content-based recommendation systems
  - Why needed here: The entire study is about improving content-based recommender systems by enhancing user and item profiles
  - Quick check question: In content-based recommendation, what is the role of the user profile, and how is it matched to items?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document preprocessing -> Topic discovery (if applicable) -> Temporal partitioning -> Profile construction -> Indexing -> Query processing -> Matching -> Fusion -> Ranking -> Evaluation

- Critical path: Document preprocessing → Topic discovery (if applicable) → Temporal partitioning → Profile construction → Indexing → Query processing → Matching → Fusion → Ranking → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of topics (k) vs. granularity and interpretability
  - Temporal partition granularity vs. data sparsity
  - Decay function choice vs. sensitivity to recency
  - Hybrid profile construction order (topical-temporal vs. temporal-topical) vs. model fit

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor topic coherence (LDA finds irrelevant or overlapping topics)
  - Empty temporal partitions (insufficient data for some periods)
  - Overfitting with too many topics or too fine-grained temporal splits
  - Decay functions that overly suppress older but still relevant content

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Monolithic vs. Atomic profiles on the dataset
  2. Topical only: Vary k (20, 110, 400) and compare to baselines
  3. Temporal only: Apply both decay functions (linear and 2Sqrt) and compare to topical results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the number of topics (k) affect the performance of topical profiles when the LDA algorithm is applied globally versus locally?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that they tested different values of k (20, 110, 400) for LDA, but they do not explicitly analyze the impact of these values on the performance of topical profiles when applied globally versus locally
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of topical profiles with different values of k when applied globally versus locally
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the performance of topical profiles with different values of k when applied globally versus locally, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of decay function affect the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that they tested two decay functions (linear and doubled squared root) and found that the doubled squared root function performed better, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the choice of decay function on the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles with different decay functions
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles with different decay functions, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of temporal partitioning affect the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that they used four temporal partitions of two years each and one of only one year, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the choice of temporal partitioning on the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles with different temporal partitioning schemes
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the performance of temporal profiles and hybrid profiles with different temporal partitioning schemes, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score

## Limitations

- Results are based on a single publication venue recommendation dataset within the biomedical domain
- Optimal parameters (110 topics, doubled squared root decay) are dataset-dependent and may not generalize
- Decay functions assume users prefer recent content, which may not hold for all recommendation scenarios

## Confidence

- High confidence: Topical and temporal dimensions can improve content-based recommendations when applied separately
- Medium confidence: Temporal-topical hybrid profiles outperform topical-temporal ones for this specific dataset and task
- Low confidence: The specific parameter choices (110 topics, doubled squared root decay) will generalize to other domains or recommendation types

## Next Checks

1. Test the temporal-topical approach on a non-scientific domain (e.g., news recommendation or product recommendation) to assess domain transferability
2. Evaluate whether the doubled squared root decay function outperforms linear decay across different temporal granularities (monthly vs. yearly partitions)
3. Compare the hybrid approach against modern transformer-based methods that can implicitly capture both topical and temporal information
