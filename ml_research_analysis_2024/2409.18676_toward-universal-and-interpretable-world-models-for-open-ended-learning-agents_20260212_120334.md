# Toward Universal and Interpretable World Models for Open-ended Learning Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18676
- Authors: Lancelot Da Costa
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper introduces a sparse, compositional class of Bayesian networks designed for open-ended learning agents

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for learning interpretable world models in open-ended agents by combining Bayesian structure learning with intrinsically motivated planning. The approach leverages hierarchical compositions of discrete partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and continuous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to create multi-scale representations of agent-environment dynamics. Through sparse network structures and variational inference methods, the framework aims to balance expressiveness with computational tractability while maintaining interpretability through causal encoding.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a class of sparse, compositional Bayesian networks that integrate discrete POMDPs and continuous SDEs into hierarchical structures. These models support efficient variational inference for learning and planning, enabling agents to actively develop world models through environmental interactions. The framework uses intrinsic motivation to guide exploration and refinement of models, combining discrete state transitions for symbolic variables with continuous dynamics for smooth processes. The hierarchical arrangement allows modeling at multiple timescales and abstractions while maintaining computational efficiency through sparsity constraints.

## Key Results
- Introduces a novel class of sparse, compositional Bayesian networks for world modeling
- Demonstrates integration of discrete POMDPs and continuous SDEs into hierarchical structures
- Shows capability for modeling video from raw pixels and planning from sensory data
- Addresses scalability challenges in developmental AI through coarse yet expressive candidate model spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical stacking of discrete POMDPs and continuous SDEs creates interpretable multi-scale world models
- Mechanism: The framework composes discrete POMDPs and continuous SDEs into hierarchical structures. Each layer operates at different timescales and abstractions, with discrete states handling symbolic/categorical variables and continuous states handling smooth dynamics. The hierarchical arrangement allows coarse-to-fine modeling of agent-environment interactions.
- Core assumption: The data-generating process can be approximated by combinations of discrete state transitions and continuous differential equations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This framework combines discrete and continuous state-space models—specifically partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and stochastic differential equations—into hierarchical structures."
  - [section] "Stacking hierarchies of discrete layers atop hierarchies of continuous layers yields mixed generative models that can express rich non-linearities and dynamics at several levels of abstraction."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on dialogue agents and creative tasks rather than hierarchical world models
- Break condition: When the true data-generating process involves dynamics that cannot be decomposed into discrete switches and continuous flows, or when the hierarchical timescale separation assumption fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Variational inference enables tractable learning in this sparse Bayesian network class
- Mechanism: The sparse structure of the proposed Bayesian networks enables efficient variational inference methods. Rather than requiring sampling-based approaches, the restricted network architecture allows for fast, deterministic updates to approximate posterior beliefs over states and parameters.
- Core assumption: The sparsity constraints don't overly restrict the expressiveness needed to model the target environment
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The models support efficient inference and learning through variational methods, making them computationally tractable."
  - [section] "Each Bayesnet in this class should be: (iv) Support fast action, perception and learning."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of variational inference in neighbor papers
- Break condition: When the environment requires dense connectivity for accurate modeling, making variational updates intractable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Active inference through intrinsic motivation drives the development of world models
- Mechanism: The agent actively explores its environment to refine its world models, guided by intrinsic motivation principles. This combines goal-directed behavior with information-seeking actions, allowing the agent to develop increasingly accurate models through interaction rather than passive observation.
- Core assumption: The intrinsic motivation framework provides appropriate exploration-exploitation balance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach integrating Bayesian structure learning and intrinsically motivated (model-based) planning enables agents to actively develop and refine their world models"
  - [section] "Several strands of work in computational cognitive science have converged to the idea that the developmental process is a process of approximate Bayesian inference about explanations for the world...where inferences are gradually refined by actively sampling new, informative data (e.g. through intrinsic motivation)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighbor papers mention intrinsic motivation but not in the context of world model development
- Break condition: When the exploration bonus mechanism fails to balance information gain against task completion, leading to either insufficient exploration or lack of task focus

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: POMDPs provide the discrete state-space modeling framework for representing agent-environment interactions with partial observability
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP)?

- Concept: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
  - Why needed here: SDEs model continuous-state dynamics and are essential for representing smooth, continuous-time processes in the environment
  - Quick check question: How do SDEs differ from ordinary differential equations, and why are they important for modeling real-world systems?

- Concept: Variational Inference
  - Why needed here: Variational methods enable efficient approximate Bayesian inference in the proposed sparse network architectures, making learning computationally tractable
  - Quick check question: What is the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) and how does it relate to variational inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Discrete POMDP module (states, actions, observations, transitions) -> Continuous SDE module (continuous state variables, differential equations) -> Hierarchical composition layer (stacks modules at multiple timescales)

- Critical path: Initialize hierarchical Bayesian network structure -> Collect initial observations through interaction -> Perform variational inference to update beliefs about states and parameters -> Use model for planning and action selection -> Observe outcomes and repeat inference cycle

- Design tradeoffs: Expressiveness vs tractability (sparser models are more interpretable but may miss dependencies), discrete vs continuous layers (symbolic reasoning vs smooth dynamics), hierarchical depth (abstraction vs computational cost)

- Failure signatures: Poor performance due to overly sparse structure, computational intractability when model becomes too complex, exploration failure when intrinsic motivation fails to balance exploration-exploitation, representational failure when discrete/continuous split doesn't match environment structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement single-layer discrete POMDP on grid-world environment to verify basic inference and planning
  2. Add continuous SDE layer to model velocity/acceleration in same grid-world, testing discrete-continuous integration
  3. Build two-layer hierarchical model (discrete planning + continuous execution) on CartPole to validate multi-scale modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the fundamental limits of the proposed Bayesian network class in terms of scalability and expressiveness when applied to complex real-world environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should seek the limits of this approach, including its scalability and ability to express relevant agent-environment interactions."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need to explore these limits but does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical bounds for scalability and expressiveness in complex environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the proposed approach with existing methods on benchmark environments, theoretical analysis of computational complexity, and case studies in real-world applications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rsLDS) architecture be extended to handle non-Markovian noise signals while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Looking forward, it seems desirable to extend the rsLDS architecture to express SDEs with more arbitrary noise signals, perhaps by adding generalised coordinates (velocity, acceleration, and higher orders of motion etc)."
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this extension as a future direction but does not provide a concrete method or implementation details for achieving this goal.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed algorithm for extending rsLDS to handle non-Markovian noise, computational complexity analysis, and empirical validation on relevant tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective ways to balance the trade-off between expressiveness and computational tractability in the proposed class of Bayesian networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "There is already a tension between requirements (i)-(2) and a significant difficulty lies in striking the right balance."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this tension but does not provide a systematic method for determining the optimal balance for different applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework for quantifying expressiveness and computational tractability, guidelines for selecting appropriate model complexity based on task requirements, and empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of different balancing strategies.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can the proposed approach be scaled to handle high-dimensional sensory inputs (e.g., raw video streams) while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "This class of Bayesnets has been used to model video from raw pixels and sound files."
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions successful applications to video and sound, it does not provide details on how the approach scales to higher-dimensional inputs or maintains interpretability in such cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies on video processing tasks, analysis of model complexity and interpretability as input dimensionality increases, and techniques for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction that preserve interpretability.

## Limitations
- The sparse Bayesian network structure may inadequately capture dense dependencies present in real-world environments
- Intrinsic motivation component lacks specification regarding how exploration bonuses balance with task completion
- Hierarchical timescale separation assumption may fail when true dynamics cannot be decomposed into discrete switches and continuous flows

## Confidence
- Hierarchical multi-scale modeling: Medium confidence - The theoretical foundation is sound, but practical implementation details and empirical validation remain limited
- Variational inference tractability: Medium confidence - While sparsity enables efficient updates, the exact computational complexity in realistic scenarios is unclear
- Active inference through intrinsic motivation: Low confidence - The integration of exploration and model refinement is conceptually promising but lacks concrete algorithmic specification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies removing hierarchical layers or sparsity constraints to quantify their contribution to model performance and tractability
2. Measure inference time and memory usage across varying model complexity to establish practical scalability limits
3. Test whether world models learned in one environment can be effectively adapted to novel environments, validating the claimed generality of the approach
