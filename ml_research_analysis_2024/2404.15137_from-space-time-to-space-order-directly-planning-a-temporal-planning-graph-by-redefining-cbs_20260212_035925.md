# From Space-Time to Space-Order: Directly Planning a Temporal Planning Graph by Redefining CBS

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15137
- Reference count: 15
- Directly plans TPGs by redefining CBS framework to minimize coordination between agents

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Space-Order CBS (SO-CBS), a novel approach that directly plans Temporal Plan Graphs (TPGs) for multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) by redefining the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) framework. Instead of planning space-time paths and then post-processing them into TPGs, SO-CBS plans space-order paths where agents visit locations in relative orders rather than specific timesteps. The method explicitly minimizes coordination between agents by defining unique conflicts and constraints that maintain completeness while avoiding combinatorial explosion. Experiments demonstrate that SO-CBS significantly reduces coordination (30-90% fewer Type-2 edges) compared to ECBS-POST baselines, leading to TPGs that are more robust to random delays during execution with up to 16.2% reduction in wait time and 9.1% reduction in total execution time.

## Method Summary
SO-CBS reinterprets TPGs as space-visitation order paths where agents visit locations in relative orders rather than specific timesteps. The approach plans these space-order paths directly while explicitly minimizing coordination between agents, unlike traditional methods that plan space-time paths and then post-process them into TPGs. The method defines unique conflicts and constraints to maintain completeness while avoiding the combinatorial explosion of standard CBS. By focusing on relative ordering rather than absolute timing, SO-CBS creates TPGs that are more robust to execution delays and communication constraints in real-world multi-agent systems.

## Key Results
- SO-CBS reduces Type-2 coordination edges by 30-90% compared to ECBS-POST baselines
- Up to 16.2% reduction in wait time during TPG execution under random delays
- 9.1% reduction in total execution time with improved robustness to communication constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SO-CBS works by fundamentally changing how temporal coordination is represented and planned. Instead of planning precise space-time paths where agents must coordinate on exact meeting times, it plans space-order paths that only specify relative visitation orders. This abstraction reduces the need for explicit coordination while maintaining the ability to reconstruct valid space-time paths when needed. The method's unique conflict definition allows it to maintain completeness guarantees while dramatically reducing the search space compared to standard CBS. By focusing on minimizing coordination during planning rather than post-processing, SO-CBS creates TPGs that are inherently more robust to the delays and uncertainties present in real-world execution.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal Plan Graphs (TPGs)**: Directed graphs encoding relative timing between agents' actions at locations. Why needed: TPGs enable decentralized execution where agents can adapt to delays without replanning. Quick check: Can reconstruct valid space-time paths from TPG edges.

**Space-Order vs Space-Time Planning**: Space-order plans specify relative visitation orders, while space-time plans specify exact timesteps. Why needed: Space-order planning reduces coordination requirements and improves robustness to delays. Quick check: Compare coordination edges between space-order and space-time solutions.

**CBS Conflict Definition**: Standard CBS defines conflicts when agents occupy the same location at the same time. Why needed: Traditional conflict definition leads to combinatorial explosion in multi-agent planning. Quick check: Count conflicts in different planning scenarios.

**Type-1 vs Type-2 TPG Edges**: Type-1 edges represent local ordering constraints, while Type-2 edges represent coordination between agents. Why needed: Minimizing Type-2 edges reduces communication requirements during execution. Quick check: Measure ratio of Type-2 to total edges in generated TPGs.

**Decentralized Execution**: Execution where agents operate independently using local information from TPGs. Why needed: Real-world multi-agent systems often have communication constraints. Quick check: Simulate execution with limited communication bandwidth.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: SO-CBS -> Conflict Detection -> Constraint Generation -> High-Level Search -> Space-Order Plan -> TPG Generation

**Critical Path**: The core innovation lies in redefining the conflict detection and constraint generation components to work with space-order rather than space-time representations, which fundamentally changes the search space and solution quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: SO-CBS trades increased planning time for significantly reduced coordination during execution. The larger search space allows finding solutions with fewer Type-2 edges, but this comes at the cost of more complex planning algorithms and longer computation times.

**Failure Signatures**: Planning failures occur when the space-order representation cannot capture necessary temporal constraints, leading to incomplete TPGs. Execution failures manifest as deadlocks when relative ordering constraints are insufficient for safe navigation.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare Type-2 edge reduction on standard MAPF benchmarks, 2) Measure execution time under various delay distributions, 3) Evaluate scalability with increasing agent counts from 3 to 20 agents.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Planning time increases due to the larger search space, though the relationship wasn't thoroughly analyzed
- Experiments limited to MAPF-POST benchmarks with 3-20 agents, leaving scalability to larger instances uncertain
- Performance on non-grid domains, heterogeneous agents, and dynamic environments remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence in SO-CBS's ability to reduce coordination and improve TPG robustness based on consistent experimental improvements
- Medium confidence in scalability claims due to limited agent count range (3-20 agents)
- Low confidence in the inherent relationship between larger search space and longer planning times without thorough comparative analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test SO-CBS on larger instances (50+ agents) and non-grid domains to assess scalability limits
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing SO-CBS's planning time against optimized space-time planners with TPG post-processing
3. Evaluate SO-CBS's performance under realistic communication constraints where agents have limited bandwidth for conflict resolution during planning
