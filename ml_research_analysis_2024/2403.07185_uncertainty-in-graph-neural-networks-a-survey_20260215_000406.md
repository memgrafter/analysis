# Uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.07185
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07185
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing identification, quantification, and utilization of uncertainty to improve GNN performance and reliability across diverse applications.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing the critical need to quantify and utilize uncertainty for enhancing model performance and reliability. The authors classify uncertainty sources into aleatoric (data), epistemic (model), and distributional (test data), and categorize quantification methods into single deterministic models, single models with random parameters, and ensemble models. They discuss evaluation metrics for uncertainty quantification and demonstrate how uncertainty is utilized in downstream tasks such as active learning, abnormality detection, trustworthy GNN modeling, and real-world applications like traffic forecasting and molecular property prediction. The survey highlights the importance of fine-grained uncertainty identification, constructing ground-truth datasets, and designing efficient methods for real-world applications. It concludes by calling for systematic validation of uncertainty methods across various tasks and the development of robust uncertainty quantification methods tailored for graphs.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a three-stage framework: (1) identifying sources of uncertainty (aleatoric, epistemic, distributional), (2) quantifying uncertainty using various methods (single deterministic models, single models with random parameters, ensemble models), and (3) utilizing uncertainty for downstream tasks (active learning, abnormality detection, trustworthy GNN modeling, real-world applications). The authors systematically review existing literature on GNN uncertainty quantification methods, analyze their effectiveness in downstream tasks, and examine real-world applications across diverse domains.

## Key Results
- GNNs inherently suffer from under-confidence and over-fitting, making uncertainty quantification crucial for reliable predictions.
- Bayesian and ensemble methods improve uncertainty estimation by sampling model parameters but face computational trade-offs.
- Uncertainty-based node selection in active learning and self-training improves label efficiency and robustness by focusing on uncertain regions of the graph.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GNNs benefit from uncertainty quantification because they inherently suffer from under-confidence and over-fitting in graph-structured data.
- Mechanism: Quantifying uncertainty separates epistemic uncertainty (reducible model errors) from aleatoric uncertainty (irreducible data noise), enabling more robust predictions and targeted interventions.
- Core assumption: The separation of uncertainty types allows task-specific mitigation strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states predictive uncertainty stems from "inherent randomness in data and model training errors".
  - [section 1] notes GNNs "present uncertainty towards their predictions, leading to unstable and erroneous prediction results".
  - [section 3] explains that epistemic uncertainty is reducible through model structure and training choices.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ensemble and Bayesian methods improve uncertainty estimation by sampling model parameters.
- Mechanism: Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble averaging approximate posterior distributions over model parameters, capturing epistemic uncertainty via prediction variance.
- Core assumption: Sampling model parameters introduces variability that reflects the model's uncertainty about its own predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] describes Monte Carlo dropout sampling weights for variational inference in Bayesian GNNs.
  - [section 3.3] notes ensemble models derive predictions from multiple independent models with different parameters.
  - [section 3.4] uses mutual information (MI) to measure model uncertainty as the difference between total entropy and data entropy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Uncertainty-based node selection in active learning and self-training improves label efficiency and robustness.
- Mechanism: Nodes with high predictive entropy or low confidence are selected for labeling, focusing human effort on uncertain regions of the graph.
- Core assumption: Uncertainty correlates with the potential for model improvement upon receiving labels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] details using entropy-measured uncertainty and mutual information to select nodes in graph active learning.
  - [section 4.1] explains self-training selects top-K confident nodes to expand labeled sets.
  - [section 4.2] uses uncertainty as a metric for abnormality detection (OOD, outlier, misclassification).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aggregate neighborhood information via message passing.
  - Why needed here: Understanding GNNs is prerequisite to grasping how uncertainty propagates through graph structures.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between node-level and graph-level aggregation in GNNs?

- Concept: Types of uncertainty (aleatoric, epistemic, distributional).
  - Why needed here: The survey explicitly separates these sources; confusion here undermines understanding of quantification methods.
  - Quick check question: Can aleatoric uncertainty be reduced by changing the model architecture?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for uncertainty (entropy, mutual information, confidence calibration).
  - Why needed here: Without metrics, uncertainty estimation is unvalidated; the survey emphasizes the lack of ground-truth datasets.
  - Quick check question: Why is mutual information preferred over simple entropy for model uncertainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Uncertainty Sources -> Quantification Methods -> Downstream Tasks
- Critical path: Identify uncertainty source → Select quantification method → Evaluate with task-specific metrics → Integrate into downstream task
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single deterministic models: Fast but may under-estimate uncertainty
  - Bayesian/ensemble methods: More accurate uncertainty but higher computational cost
  - Direct methods: Simple but not calibrated for distribution shift
- Failure signatures:
  - Overconfident predictions despite high error → poor calibration
  - Uncertainty estimates inconsistent across similar samples → method instability
  - Computational cost prohibitive for real-time use → scalability issue
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement entropy-based uncertainty on a node classification dataset; compare confidence vs accuracy
  2. Apply Monte Carlo dropout on the same dataset; measure mutual information and compare to entropy baseline
  3. Test ensemble averaging with 5 models; evaluate predictive variance and task performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop fine-grained uncertainty measures for specific graph components, such as heterophily or structural shifts in node features/labels/topology?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that current research lacks identification and quantification of uncertainty tailored to specific graph components, and suggests exploring fine-grained uncertainties like shifts in node features, labels, and graph structure.
- Why unresolved: Existing methods often treat uncertainty at a high level without decomposing it into specific sources relevant to graph structure, making it difficult to understand which components contribute most to predictive uncertainty.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study decomposing uncertainty into component-specific measures (e.g., heterophily-based, feature-shift-based, topology-shift-based) with validation on real-world graphs showing their correlation with prediction errors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective uncertainty quantification methods for specific downstream tasks like active learning, OOD detection, and robustness, and does separating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty improve performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes a lack of systematic validation of uncertainty methods across tasks and questions whether separating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty is necessary, citing mixed results in graph active learning and outlier detection.
- Why unresolved: Most studies use generic uncertainty measures (e.g., entropy, softmax probability) without comparing alternative methods or justifying the need for uncertainty separation, leading to inconsistent findings across tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking multiple uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., mutual information, predictive variance, Dirichlet-based) across diverse graph tasks with ablation studies on aleatoric/epistemic separation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we construct ground-truth datasets and unified evaluation metrics for graph uncertainty quantification, given the lack of real-world data with known uncertainty sources?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the lack of ground-truth datasets and unified evaluation metrics as a critical unresolved issue, noting that synthetic data cannot fully simulate real-world uncertainty and that task-specific metrics are not directly comparable.
- Why unresolved: Real-world graphs rarely have labeled uncertainty sources, and synthetic graphs lack the complexity of real scenarios. Current evaluation relies on indirect measures (e.g., task performance) rather than direct uncertainty quality assessment.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework for annotating real-world graphs with uncertainty sources (e.g., human-labeled aleatoric uncertainty, controlled distributional shifts) and a standardized benchmark suite with multiple evaluation metrics across tasks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the most efficient and robust uncertainty quantification methods for real-world applications, balancing computational cost, task relevance, and generalization across diverse settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-offs between methods (e.g., ensemble models are accurate but computationally expensive) and calls for developing efficient, easy-to-apply, and robust methods that can identify diverse uncertainty sources.
- Why unresolved: Current methods often prioritize accuracy over efficiency or lack robustness to distributional shifts, making them impractical for large-scale or resource-constrained applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of uncertainty methods on large-scale graphs, measuring accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to shifts, with ablation studies on graph-specific adaptations (e.g., ensemble distillation, test-time augmentation).

## Limitations

- Confidence Calibration: Many uncertainty quantification methods lack proper calibration across diverse graph structures and distributions, leading to potentially misleading confidence estimates.
- Ground-Truth Benchmarks: Absence of standardized datasets and metrics for evaluating uncertainty quantification methods limits fair comparison and systematic validation.
- Computational Trade-offs: Bayesian and ensemble methods provide more accurate uncertainty estimates but face scalability challenges for large-scale graph applications.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The classification of uncertainty sources (aleatoric, epistemic, distributional) and the general categorization of quantification methods are well-established in the literature.
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of uncertainty utilization in downstream tasks (active learning, abnormality detection) is supported by existing studies but lacks comprehensive validation across diverse scenarios.
- Low Confidence: Claims about real-world application effectiveness are largely based on limited case studies without systematic benchmarking across domains.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test uncertainty quantification methods across multiple graph datasets with varying characteristics (heterophily/homophily, size, sparsity) to assess robustness and generalizability.
2. **Calibration Assessment**: Evaluate confidence calibration using proper scoring rules (expected calibration error, maximum calibration error) across in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets.
3. **Computational Efficiency Benchmarking**: Compare computational overhead of different uncertainty methods (Bayesian, ensemble, deterministic) on large-scale graphs, measuring both accuracy gains and runtime costs.
