# Do LLMs Overcome Shortcut Learning? An Evaluation of Shortcut Challenges in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13343
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13343
- Authors: Yu Yuan; Lili Zhao; Kai Zhang; Guangting Zheng; Qi Liu
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: LLMs experience significant performance drops (up to 52%) on shortcut-laden datasets, especially larger models under zero-shot/few-shot prompting, while Chain-of-Thought prompting reduces shortcut reliance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Shortcut Suite, a comprehensive test suite to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on dataset shortcuts during inference. The suite tests six types of shortcuts (Lexical Overlap, Subsequence, Constituent, Negation, Position, and Style) across five metrics (accuracy, semantic fidelity, internal consistency, explanation quality, and confidence) and four prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, zero-shot CoT, and few-shot CoT). Experiments on multiple LLMs reveal that while models perform well on standard datasets, they experience significant performance drops when shortcuts are present, especially on Constituent and Negation datasets. Larger models are more prone to shortcut usage under zero-shot and few-shot prompts, while CoT prompting consistently reduces shortcut reliance. Models also exhibit overconfidence in their predictions and lower explanation quality on shortcut datasets, with errors categorized as distraction, disguised comprehension, and logical fallacy.

## Method Summary
The method involves creating shortcut-laden datasets from standard benchmarks (MultiNLI, HANS) by introducing various shortcut patterns. Six shortcut types are tested: Lexical Overlap, Subsequence, Constituent, Negation, Position, and Style. Five evaluation metrics are used: accuracy, semantic fidelity score (SFS), internal consistency score (ICS), explanation quality score (EQS), and confidence score (CFS). Four prompting strategies are evaluated: zero-shot, few-shot, zero-shot CoT, and few-shot CoT. Experiments are conducted on multiple LLMs using the Shortcut Suite, and results are analyzed by comparing performance on shortcut-laden datasets versus standard datasets, examining explanation quality, confidence levels, and error types.

## Key Results
- LLMs experience up to 52% performance drops on shortcut-laden datasets compared to standard datasets
- Larger LLMs are more prone to utilizing shortcuts under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning prompts
- Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently reduces shortcut reliance and outperforms other prompting strategies
- Models exhibit overconfidence in predictions and lower explanation quality on shortcut datasets
- Errors are categorized as distraction, disguised comprehension, and logical fallacy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spurious Correlation Exploitation
- Claim: LLMs rely on dataset biases as shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generalization on out-of-distribution samples.
- Mechanism: When encountering input text, models identify and exploit spurious correlations between surface-level features (e.g., lexical overlap, negation words) and labels rather than performing deep semantic analysis.
- Core assumption: The model's training data contains consistent but non-causal correlations between certain textual patterns and labels.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "LLMs may rely on dataset biases as shortcuts for prediction, which can significantly impair their robustness and generalization capabilities." [section 1] "Models with poor robustness and generalization may rely on 'shortcut learning,' where they develop decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions."

### Mechanism 2: Prompt Strategy Influence
- Claim: Different prompting strategies significantly affect LLM reliance on shortcuts, with Chain-of-Thought prompting reducing shortcut usage.
- Mechanism: CoT prompting forces models to explicitly reason through the problem step-by-step, making shortcut exploitation more difficult and less likely.
- Core assumption: The reasoning process required by CoT prompts creates cognitive friction that prevents quick reliance on spurious correlations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Chain-of-thought prompting notably reduces shortcut reliance and outperforms other prompting strategies." [section 4.4] "We find that LLMs are less affected by shortcuts under CoT settings than others."

### Mechanism 3: Model Size and Shortcut Susceptibility
- Claim: Larger LLMs are more prone to utilizing shortcuts under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning prompts.
- Mechanism: Larger models have more parameters and capacity to memorize and exploit complex spurious correlations in the training data.
- Core assumption: Increased model capacity enables better pattern recognition, including recognition of spurious correlations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Larger LLMs are more likely to utilize shortcuts under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning prompts." [section 5.1.1] "As the model size increases, it tends to rely more on spurious mapping for NLI tasks, resulting in lower accuracy."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dataset Bias and Spurious Correlations
  - Why needed here: Understanding how models can learn incorrect associations between features and labels is fundamental to grasping shortcut learning.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify an example where two features are correlated in training data but not causally related in reality?

- Concept: In-Context Learning and Prompting Strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper extensively compares different prompting approaches and their effects on shortcut learning, requiring understanding of ICL mechanics.
  - Quick check question: How does few-shot prompting differ from zero-shot prompting, and why might few-shot be more susceptible to shortcut learning?

- Concept: Semantic vs. Syntactic Analysis
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts models that rely on surface-level patterns versus deep semantic understanding, which is central to the shortcut learning problem.
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between matching word sequences and understanding the logical relationship between premise and hypothesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Shortcut Suite datasets -> Model prompting (4 strategies) -> Response generation -> Metric calculation (5 metrics) -> Error analysis -> Interpretation of shortcut reliance patterns
- Critical path: Data creation → Model prompting → Response generation → Metric calculation → Error analysis → Interpretation of shortcut reliance patterns
- Design tradeoffs: The paper balances comprehensiveness (testing multiple shortcut types and metrics) against practical constraints (limited model access, computational resources). They chose NLI as the primary task due to its ability to encapsulate various shortcut types.
- Failure signatures: Models showing high accuracy on standard datasets but significant performance drops on shortcut datasets, overconfidence in predictions, lower explanation quality on shortcut datasets, and inverse scaling patterns where larger models perform worse on shortcut datasets.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run standard vs. shortcut dataset accuracy comparison on a single LLM to establish baseline shortcut susceptibility.
  2. Compare zero-shot vs. CoT prompting performance on a shortcut dataset to verify the prompting strategy effect.
  3. Test the same model across different shortcut types to identify which shortcuts are most problematic.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective debiasing techniques to mitigate shortcut learning in LLMs across different task types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that shortcut learning impairs robustness and generalization, mentions existing approaches like DRiFt and LTGR, and suggests fine-tuning on unbiased datasets as a potential direction.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problem and suggests potential directions (fine-tuning, advanced prompting, retrieval augmentation), it doesn't empirically evaluate or compare different debiasing techniques or propose specific methods to effectively mitigate shortcut learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing the effectiveness of different debiasing techniques (fine-tuning, advanced prompting like CoT, retrieval augmentation, adversarial training) on reducing shortcut reliance across multiple NLP tasks and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different prompting strategies interact with shortcut learning across model scales and architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that larger models are more prone to shortcut usage under zero-shot and few-shot prompts, while CoT prompting reduces shortcut reliance. However, it notes that few-shot prompts generally underperform compared to zero-shot, suggesting potential biases from in-context examples.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides initial observations about prompting strategies but doesn't fully explore the mechanisms behind why CoT helps, how few-shot biases affect different model sizes, or whether other prompting techniques could be more effective for mitigating shortcuts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of how different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, chain-of-density, least-to-most prompting) affect shortcut learning across various model sizes, architectures, and task types, including ablation studies on what components of CoT make it effective.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there universal patterns in how LLMs process shortcut information versus semantic content, and can these patterns be used to predict shortcut reliance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies three error types (distraction, disguised comprehension, logical fallacy) and observes patterns like overconfidence in predictions, bias toward certain labels, and focus on local information over comprehensive context.
- Why unresolved: While the paper catalogs error types and observations, it doesn't develop a predictive framework for when LLMs will rely on shortcuts versus genuine semantic understanding, nor does it explore whether these patterns generalize across different model architectures or training paradigms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of diagnostic tools or metrics that can predict shortcut reliance based on model architecture, training data characteristics, and input features, validated across multiple LLMs and tasks.

## Limitations
- The Shortcut Suite focuses primarily on NLI tasks, which may not generalize to other NLP domains or multimodal applications
- The evaluation relies on automatic metrics for explanation quality and confidence, which may not fully capture nuanced model reasoning
- Model access limitations restricted testing to commercially available LLMs, potentially missing open-source or smaller model behaviors

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The performance drop patterns on shortcut datasets (up to 52% decrease) and the consistent improvement from CoT prompting are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: The inverse scaling relationship between model size and shortcut susceptibility requires further validation across more diverse model families
- **Medium Confidence**: The error type classification (distraction, disguised comprehension, logical fallacy) is based on manual annotation of limited samples

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments with additional task types (e.g., question answering, summarization) to test generalizability of shortcut learning patterns
2. Conduct ablation studies removing specific shortcut types to isolate their individual contributions to performance degradation
3. Test the same models on adversarial examples designed to exploit identified shortcut patterns to measure practical robustness
