# Transparent Networks for Multivariate Time Series

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10535
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10535
- Authors: Minkyu Kim, Suan Lee, Jinho Kim
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: GATSM achieves comparable performance to black-box models like Transformer while maintaining transparency, significantly outperforming existing transparent models across eight real-world datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GATSM, a novel transparent neural network model for multivariate time series that combines time-sharing neural basis models with masked multi-head attention. The model addresses the fundamental limitation of existing generalized additive models, which cannot effectively handle time series data due to their inability to capture temporal dependencies. GATSM achieves performance comparable to black-box models like Transformer while maintaining interpretability through additive feature functions and attention weights, providing insights into feature contributions, time-step importance, and time-dependent feature contributions.

## Method Summary
GATSM extends the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework to handle time series data by incorporating time-sharing neural basis models (NBMs) and masked multi-head attention. Instead of using separate feature functions for each time step (which would require T×M functions), GATSM uses B basis functions shared across all time steps, with attention weights capturing temporal patterns. The model applies masked attention to prevent information leakage from future time steps and uses positional encoding to capture temporal dependencies. Predictions are made through a weighted combination of attended features, maintaining transparency by decomposing the output into interpretable components.

## Key Results
- GATSM achieves the best average rank among all tested models across eight real-world datasets
- Performance comparable to black-box models like Transformer while maintaining transparency
- Significantly outperforms existing transparent models including RuleFit, XGBoost, and interpretable transformers
- Demonstrates strong generalization ability, particularly on small datasets with fewer than 1,000 training samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GATSM maintains transparency by using additive feature functions combined with attention weights.
- Mechanism: The model decomposes predictions into interpretable components through time-sharing basis functions and attention scores, allowing each feature's contribution to be isolated and understood.
- Core assumption: Additive decomposition preserves interpretability while attention captures temporal dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GATSM achieves comparable performance to black-box models like Transformer and significantly outperforms existing transparent models"
  - [section] "Equation (11) shows that GATSM satisfies Definition 3.1 by encapsulating the attention scores (i.e.,α k,t,u) and time-sharing NBM (i.e.,h b) into a functionf u,m"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific additive transparency mechanism
- Break Condition: If feature interactions become too complex for simple additive decomposition to capture effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Time-sharing basis functions reduce parameter complexity while maintaining expressiveness.
- Mechanism: Instead of separate feature functions for each time step, GATSM uses shared basis functions across all time steps, reducing parameters from T×M to B.
- Core assumption: Temporal patterns can be captured through attention while feature representations remain consistent across time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Applying existing GAMs defined in Equation 1 to this time series requireT×Mfeature functions, which becomes problematic when dealing with largeTorMdue to increased model size"
  - [section] "Time-sharing NBM hasBbasis functions, with each basis functionh k(·)taking a featurex i,j as input"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for time-sharing basis function approach
- Break Condition: If temporal patterns require time-specific feature representations that cannot be captured through attention alone.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Masked multi-head attention captures temporal dependencies while preventing information leakage.
- Mechanism: Attention mechanism uses positional encoding and masking to learn temporal patterns without accessing future information.
- Core assumption: Self-attention with masking can effectively model temporal dependencies in time series data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The time mask is defined as follows: m i,j = 1 if i≥j, −∞ otherwise"
  - [section] "GATSM employs MHA to learn temporal patterns"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions transformers and attention but not specifically masked attention for time series
- Break Condition: If temporal dependencies are too complex for standard attention mechanisms to capture effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
  - Why needed here: GATSM extends GAM framework to handle time series data while maintaining interpretability
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes GAMs from standard linear models?

- Concept: Time series temporal dependencies
  - Why needed here: GATSM must capture how current values depend on past values while remaining transparent
  - Quick check question: How do temporal dependencies differ from spatial or feature interactions?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in neural networks
  - Why needed here: GATSM uses masked multi-head attention to learn temporal patterns while maintaining transparency
  - Quick check question: What role does positional encoding play in attention for time series?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input time series → Time-sharing NBM (basis functions) → Transformed features → Masked MHA (attention) → Output prediction

- Critical path:
  1. Feature transformation through time-sharing NBM
  2. Attention computation with temporal masking
  3. Weighted combination of attended features for prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared vs. separate feature functions across time steps
  - Number of basis functions (B) vs. model complexity
  - Sinusoidal vs. learnable positional encoding
  - Attention heads vs. computational efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with complex feature interactions
  - Inability to capture long-range temporal dependencies
  - Overfitting on small datasets despite transparency

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary number of basis functions (B) to find optimal tradeoff between performance and efficiency
  2. Compare sinusoidal vs. learnable positional encoding impact on performance
  3. Test different attention mechanisms (dot product vs. 2-layer) for temporal pattern capture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of basis functions in GATSM for complex datasets, and how does this number scale with dataset complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the optimal number of basis functions depends on dataset size and complexity, but does not provide specific guidelines for scaling.
- Why unresolved: The paper only suggests 100 basis functions as a general recommendation without exploring the relationship between dataset complexity and optimal basis function count.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing GATSM performance across datasets of varying complexity with systematically varied basis function counts, establishing a clear relationship between dataset characteristics and optimal basis function numbers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can GATSM be extended to handle continuous time series rather than discrete time series?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations in the "Limitations & Future Works" section, specifically mentioning the need to extend GATSM to continuous models using NeuralODE or HiPPO.
- Why unresolved: GATSM currently only handles discrete time series, limiting its applicability to scenarios requiring continuous-time modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and experimental validation of a continuous-time extension of GATSM using NeuralODE or HiPPO, demonstrating improved performance on tasks requiring continuous-time modeling.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can higher-order feature interactions be incorporated into GATSM while maintaining transparency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions in the "Limitations & Future Works" section that GATSM cannot learn higher-order feature interactions internally and suggests that feature interaction methods proposed for transparent models may help address this problem.
- Why unresolved: GATSM's current design only learns first-order feature interactions, limiting its predictive power on complex datasets with important higher-order interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a higher-order interaction mechanism within GATSM that maintains transparency, validated through experiments showing improved performance on datasets with known higher-order interactions.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation with only 8 real-world datasets, potentially affecting generalizability
- Computational complexity analysis is incomplete, particularly regarding the impact of varying basis functions and attention heads
- Interpretability claims lack rigorous validation through user studies or qualitative evaluation of explanations

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core architectural design (combining GAM framework with attention) is technically sound and the mathematical formulation is correct.
- **Medium confidence**: The performance claims are supported by experiments, but the limited dataset diversity reduces generalizability confidence.
- **Low confidence**: The interpretability claims lack rigorous validation beyond quantitative metrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on transparency components**: Systematically remove attention weights, basis functions, or additive structure to quantify their individual contributions to both performance and interpretability.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Train GATSM on datasets from one domain (e.g., energy) and test on completely different domains (e.g., healthcare or finance) to evaluate true generalization capabilities.

3. **Human interpretability evaluation**: Conduct user studies with domain experts to assess whether the provided feature contributions and time-step importance scores are actionable and meaningful in practice.
