# SAUCE: Synchronous and Asynchronous User-Customizable Environment for Multi-Agent LLM Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.03397
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03397
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Multi-agent LLM platform supporting synchronous/asynchronous communication with human-in-the-loop capabilities

## Executive Summary
SAUCE is a Python platform enabling configurable multi-agent LLM interactions in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The system allows users to define experiments through JSON configuration files where multiple LLM agents discuss topics, with the ability to model human-like communication patterns including when to speak and what to say. SAUCE supports various LLM sources, manages discussion history, and produces comprehensive logs for analysis.

The platform's key innovation is its asynchronous communication feature, where models decide when to speak in addition to what to say, thus modeling an important facet of human communication. This enables both model developers to evaluate LLM interactions and researchers to incorporate human subjects in multi-agent simulations, making it a versatile tool for studying emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems.

## Method Summary
SAUCE uses a configuration-driven architecture where experiments are defined through JSON files specifying participants, hosts, end conditions, and other parameters. The system implements abstract base classes (Person, Host, EndType) with multiple concrete implementations for different LLM sources and communication strategies. Experiments run through a main loop where the host selects a participant who then decides whether to speak based on conversation context and timing information. The platform produces comprehensive output logs capturing discussion history and participant survey responses, enabling reproducible research in multi-agent LLM interaction.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated that LLM agents conform to inherent social biases even when instructed to debate from specific perspectives in synchronous political debate simulations
- Showed that asynchronous communication leads to diverse speaking strategies based on personality traits and time constraints, with some agents actively engaging while others remain silent
- Validated platform flexibility by successfully running experiments with different LLM models (Vicuna-13b, Alpaca-13b, Llama3-8b, Claude3-Haiku) across both synchronous and asynchronous settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SAUCE models real-world human communication by incorporating asynchronous message scheduling where agents decide when to speak.
- Mechanism: The platform provides an AsynchronousPerson abstract class that allows agents to return None when deciding not to speak, enabling context-dependent participation based on discussion history and time constraints.
- Core assumption: LLM agents can make reasonable decisions about when to speak based on conversation context and timing information provided in prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A novel feature of SAUCE is our asynchronous communication feature, where models decide when to speak in addition to what to say, thus modeling an important facet of human communication."
  - [section 3.4.2] "To simulate asynchronous communication, the abstract AsynchronousPerson class enables returning None as a potential output for the generate_answer method, indicating that the participant chose not to speak."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers mentioning asynchronous communication in LLM contexts, showing this is an active research area.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SAUCE enables reproducible multi-agent experiments through configuration-driven architecture.
- Mechanism: Experiments are defined through JSON configuration files that specify participants, hosts, end conditions, and other parameters, allowing exact replication of experimental conditions.
- Core assumption: Configuration files capture all necessary experimental parameters to ensure identical execution across runs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments can be consistently reproduced by using the same configuration files."
  - [section 3] "The fundamental object in the SAUCE platform is the Experiment, which is configured in a JSON file... Its primary methods are load_from_file, which initiates an instance based on a JSON configuration, and run, which executes the experiment."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SAUCE supports both model evaluation and human-in-the-loop research through its flexible participant architecture.
- Mechanism: The platform implements both LLM-based Person classes (PersonOpenAiCompletion, PersonHuggingFace) and Human classes that allow interactive user input, enabling mixed human-AI experiments.
- Core assumption: The same experiment framework can meaningfully incorporate both automated LLM agents and human participants.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Second, SAUCE enables user studies incorporating human subjects interacting with LLMs in such settings."
  - [section 3.4.1] "We also implemented Human, which allows to configure a human participant in the experiment. When using this subclass the system interactively prompts the user for input and uses that input as the generated message."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Abstract base classes and inheritance in Python
  - Why needed here: SAUCE uses abstract classes like Person and Host with multiple concrete implementations (PersonOpenAiCompletion, HostRoundRobin, etc.) to create a flexible plugin architecture.
  - Quick check question: How would you implement a new person type that uses a local Ollama model while maintaining compatibility with the existing asynchronous interface?

- Concept: JSON configuration parsing and validation
  - Why needed here: The entire experiment setup is driven by JSON files that must be correctly parsed and validated to instantiate the appropriate classes with their required parameters.
  - Quick check question: What validation would you add to ensure that a configuration file correctly specifies either "generation_model_name" or "model_path" for each person?

- Concept: Asynchronous programming patterns
  - Why needed here: While the platform uses synchronous Python code, it models asynchronous behavior through time-based decision making and the ability for agents to skip turns.
  - Quick check question: How would you modify the platform to support true asynchronous I/O if agents needed to fetch external information before deciding to speak?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Experiment (JSON config) -> SessionRoom (conversation manager) -> Host (turn selector) -> Person (message generator/decider) -> EndType (termination condition)
- Critical path: Configuration load -> Experiment instantiation -> SessionRoom initialization -> Main loop (Host selects person -> Person generates/skips message -> Update history) -> End condition check -> Survey collection
- Design tradeoffs: The platform prioritizes flexibility and ease of configuration over performance optimization, using simple polling loops rather than event-driven architectures to keep the system understandable and debuggable.
- Failure signatures: Common failures include misconfigured JSON files causing class instantiation errors, agents getting stuck in infinite loops due to incorrect end conditions, or communication breakdowns when agents consistently choose not to speak.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the default synchronous debate configuration to verify basic functionality with two different LLM models.
  2. Modify the configuration to use HostRandom instead of HostRoundRobin to test different scheduling strategies.
  3. Implement a simple custom Person subclass that always speaks after exactly three turns to test the asynchronous decision-making framework.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different LLM architectures (e.g., transformer-based vs. other) perform in multi-agent synchronous vs. asynchronous settings when modeling human communication patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions SAUCE supports various LLM sources including HuggingFace, APIs, and local setups, and shows experiments with different models (Vicuna-13b, Alpaca-13b, Llama3-8b, Claude3-Haiku)
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents limited model comparisons without systematic analysis of how different architectures affect communication patterns in synchronous vs. asynchronous settings
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing multiple LLM architectures across both communication modes, measuring metrics like response quality, timing decisions, and adherence to communication patterns

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal prompting strategies for asynchronous communication that balance between encouraging participation and maintaining natural conversation flow?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses different prompting methods for deciding when to speak, noting that indicating remaining time caused variance in speaking frequency, but doesn't provide optimal strategies
- Why unresolved: The paper presents initial findings but doesn't explore the full parameter space of prompting strategies or their effects on conversation dynamics
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments testing various prompting approaches (time indicators, participation incentives, personality-based prompts) and their impact on conversation quality metrics

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do social biases manifest differently in synchronous versus asynchronous multi-agent discussions, and what factors influence this variation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The political debate experiment showed LLM agents conform to inherent social biases even when instructed to debate from specific perspectives, but didn't compare synchronous vs asynchronous settings
- Why unresolved: The paper only examined bias manifestation in synchronous settings, leaving open how asynchronous communication might affect bias expression
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments of the same debate scenarios in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, measuring bias expression through stance shifts and opinion convergence patterns

## Limitations
- Limited experimental validation of whether LLM agents can genuinely model human-like communication patterns through turn-skipping decisions
- Lack of detailed evaluation of human participant integration and practical challenges of incorporating real humans into asynchronous LLM experiments
- Insufficient evidence demonstrating that asynchronous decision-making adds value beyond simple message generation in synchronous settings

## Confidence
- Configuration system and reproducibility: High
- Asynchronous communication modeling: Medium
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing synchronous vs asynchronous configurations with identical participant models to measure whether the asynchronous decision-making produces meaningfully different discussion patterns
2. Implement stress testing with configurations using 5+ participants to evaluate system performance and identify bottlenecks in turn management and message processing
3. Design and execute a small-scale user study where human participants interact with LLM agents in both synchronous and asynchronous modes to assess the practical usability of the Human class integration
