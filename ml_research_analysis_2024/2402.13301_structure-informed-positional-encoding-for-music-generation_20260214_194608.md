## Executive Summary
This paper introduces StructurePE, a framework for incorporating musical structure information into Transformers for symbolic music generation. The authors propose three variants - S-APE, S-RPE, and NS-RPE - that integrate structural awareness through different positional encoding strategies. The methods are evaluated on both melody and accompaniment generation tasks, showing improvements in structural and melodic properties compared to standard positional encodings. The work also establishes NoPE (Transformers without positional encoding) as a strong baseline that should be included in future research.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a framework called StructurePE that incorporates musical structure information into Transformer models for symbolic music generation. The framework includes three variants: S-APE (structure-aware absolute positional encoding), S-RPE (structure-aware relative positional encoding), and NS-RPE (no structure relative positional encoding). These methods encode both local and global musical structure information, with some variants being octave-agnostic
