# Beyond Relevant Documents: A Knowledge-Intensive Approach for Query-Focused Summarization using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.10357
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10357
- Reference count: 40
- Best approach achieves ROUGE-1 of 45.8, ROUGE-2 of 13.4, and BERTScore of 29.2

## Executive Summary
This paper reframes query-focused summarization as a knowledge-intensive language task, eliminating the assumption that relevant documents are pre-provided. Instead, it retrieves potentially relevant documents from a large knowledge corpus using BM25 or DPR models, then generates comprehensive summaries using a two-step summarization controller with GPT-3.5. The approach demonstrates superior performance on DUC datasets, achieving state-of-the-art ROUGE and BERTScore metrics while handling queries where relevant documents may not exist in initial document sets.

## Method Summary
The approach consists of two main components: a retrieval module that uses BM25 or DPR to retrieve top-k documents from one of three knowledge corpora (CorpusInt with 32K DUC documents, CorpusExt with 21M Wikipedia documents, or CorpusAug combining both), and a summarization controller that employs GPT-3.5 with few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to generate query-relevant summaries. The summarization controller uses a two-step process: first identifying query-relevant information, then generating controllable summaries. Human-annotated relevance labels are collected to evaluate both retrieval and summarization performance comprehensively.

## Key Results
- Achieves ROUGE-1 of 45.8, ROUGE-2 of 13.4, and BERTScore of 29.2 on DUC datasets
- Outperforms baseline models in both retrieval and summarization tasks
- Successfully generates accurate summaries without requiring pre-existing relevant documents
- Creates new dataset with human-annotated relevance labels (7761 query-document pairs)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-first design allows access to relevant documents when initial document sets are unavailable
- Mechanism: Uses BM25 or DPR to retrieve top-k documents from a large-scale knowledge corpus based on the query
- Core assumption: Relevant documents exist somewhere in the knowledge corpus and can be retrieved
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states retrieval module eliminates dependence on pre-existing document sets; retrieval module returns top-k documents from knowledge corpus; three knowledge corpora with millions of documents demonstrate practical implementation
- Break condition: If relevant documents don't exist in the knowledge corpus or retrieval models cannot find them due to semantic gaps

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-step summarization controller with in-context learning produces query-relevant summaries
- Mechanism: Two-step process (query-relevant information identification, then controllable summarization) with few-shot demonstrations to guide the LLM
- Core assumption: The LLM can effectively identify relevant information and generate coherent summaries when properly prompted
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions integration of LLM-based summarizer with tailored prompt; multi-step summarization controller inspired by chain-of-thought prompting; limited ablation studies on prompt effectiveness
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to understand multi-step instructions or few-shot examples are not representative

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human-annotated relevance labels enable proper evaluation of both retrieval and summarization components
- Mechanism: Creates new dataset with human annotations for document relevance
- Core assumption: Human annotations provide ground truth for relevance assessment
- Evidence anchors: Paper creates new dataset with human-annotated relevance labels; detailed annotation process and inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss Kappa of 0.42); relevance label distribution provided
- Break condition: If human annotations are inconsistent or annotated subset doesn't represent full query space

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT)
  - Why needed here: The approach reframes QFS as a knowledge-intensive task, requiring understanding of how KILT works
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes knowledge-intensive tasks from traditional supervised learning approaches?

- Concept: Dense passage retrieval (DPR) vs sparse retrieval (BM25)
  - Why needed here: The system explores both retrieval approaches, requiring understanding of their tradeoffs
  - Quick check question: When would you expect DPR to outperform BM25 in this context?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: The summarization controller uses this prompting strategy for multi-step reasoning
  - Quick check question: How does chain-of-thought prompting differ from direct prompting in LLM applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query → Retrieval Module → Top-k documents → Summarization Controller → Summary

- Critical path: Query → Retrieval Module → Top-k documents → Summarization Controller → Summary

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Retrieval vs summarization quality: Better retrieval doesn't guarantee better summaries if summarization controller fails
  - Corpus size vs retrieval effectiveness: Larger corpora provide more coverage but make retrieval harder
  - Few-shot vs zero-shot prompting: Few-shot improves performance but requires good demonstrations

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision@10/50 in retrieval indicates corpus or retrieval model issues
  - ROUGE score drops compared to traditional QFS suggest summarization controller problems
  - BERTScore significantly lower than ROUGE indicates semantic understanding issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test retrieval module alone with BM25 on CorpusInt to establish baseline precision/recall
  2. Test summarization controller with known relevant documents to isolate summarization quality
  3. Full end-to-end test comparing BM25 vs DPR performance on the complete pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the retrieval module change when using different knowledge corpora (CorpusInt, CorpusExt, CorpusAug) for various types of queries (e.g., specialized vs. general topics)?
- Basis in paper: The paper compares retrieval effectiveness across three knowledge corpora and discusses performance differences of BM25 and DPR models on these corpora
- Why unresolved: The paper provides retrieval evaluation results but does not extensively analyze how different types of queries affect retrieval performance across various knowledge corpora
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate retrieval performance for different query types across the three knowledge corpora and analyzing the impact of query characteristics on retrieval effectiveness

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of using LLM-based models for summarization in terms of computational resources and scalability, and how can these be addressed?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses GPT-3.5 for summarization, which is computationally intensive, but does not discuss limitations or scalability issues
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed analysis of computational costs, scalability, or potential limitations of using LLM-based models for summarization
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to measure computational resources required and exploring methods to improve scalability and efficiency

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed knowledge-intensive approach handle queries that require real-time or up-to-date information, given the static nature of the knowledge corpora used?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on retrieving information from static knowledge corpus and does not address providing real-time or up-to-date information
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the approach can be adapted to handle queries requiring current or frequently changing information
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating methods to incorporate real-time information sources or mechanisms to update the knowledge corpus dynamically

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on the assumption that relevant documents exist within the knowledge corpus
- Performance gains may be partially attributed to GPT-3.5 rather than fundamental improvements in task formulation
- Generalizability beyond DUC datasets and scalability to truly large-scale knowledge corpora remain uncertain

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core retrieval-first architecture and evaluation methodology are sound and well-documented
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the multi-step summarization controller is supported by results, though limited ablation studies make it difficult to isolate the contribution of specific components
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of results beyond the DUC datasets and the scalability of the approach to truly large-scale knowledge corpora remain uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on summarization controller:** Systematically remove the multi-step process and few-shot demonstrations to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements

2. **Cross-domain evaluation:** Test the approach on query-focused summarization datasets from different domains (e.g., news, scientific literature, social media) to assess generalizability

3. **Retrieval effectiveness under constrained conditions:** Evaluate performance when relevant documents are deliberately excluded from the knowledge corpus to test the approach's robustness when the core assumption is violated
