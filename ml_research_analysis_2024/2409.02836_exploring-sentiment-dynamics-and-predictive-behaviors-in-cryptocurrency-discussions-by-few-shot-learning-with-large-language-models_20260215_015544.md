# Exploring Sentiment Dynamics and Predictive Behaviors in Cryptocurrency Discussions by Few-Shot Learning with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.02836
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02836
- Authors: Moein Shahiki Tash; Zahra Ahani; Mohim Tash; Olga Kolesnikova; Grigori Sidorov
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Moderate inter-annotator agreement (0.4393%-0.7173%) achieved for classifying sentiment and predictive behaviors in cryptocurrency tweets using GPT-4o few-shot learning

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel classification scheme to analyze predictive, hope, and regret sentiments in cryptocurrency-related discussions. Using GPT-4o with few-shot learning, the authors classified 5,000 tweets across five cryptocurrencies, identifying distinct sentiment patterns and predictive behaviors. The research reveals that Matic exhibits notably higher optimistic predictions and hope sentiments compared to other cryptocurrencies, while Cardano shows the lowest prediction frequency. The moderate inter-annotator agreement scores suggest reasonable reliability in the classification results, providing valuable insights into investor behavior and sentiment trends within the cryptocurrency market.

## Method Summary
The study employed GPT-4o with few-shot learning to classify cryptocurrency-related tweets into three main categories: predictive statements (incremental, decremental, neutral, non-predictive), hope detection (generalized, realistic, unrealistic, not hope), and regret detection (action, inaction, no regret). Data collection involved gathering 1,000 tweets each for Cardano, Binance, Matic, Fantom, and Ripple from the X platform during September 2021 to March 2023. The tweets underwent preprocessing to remove URLs, special characters, and short words, followed by tokenization and normalization. The classification process utilized structured prompts with labeled examples, and inter-annotator agreement was assessed using Cohen's Kappa coefficient on a random sample of 1,000 comments.

## Key Results
- Matic demonstrated a notably higher propensity for optimistic (incremental) predictions compared to other cryptocurrencies
- Matic also showed the highest levels of both realistic and unrealistic hope sentiments
- Cardano exhibited the lowest frequency of predictive statements among the five cryptocurrencies analyzed
- Inter-annotator agreement scores ranged from 0.4393% (hope detection) to 0.7173% (predictive statement detection)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Few-shot learning with GPT-4o enables effective sentiment classification without extensive parameter updates.
- Mechanism: GPT-4o leverages its pre-trained knowledge to generalize from a small set of labeled examples, mapping new tweets to existing sentiment and prediction categories.
- Core assumption: The model's pre-training covers sufficient domain knowledge to interpret cryptocurrency discourse without task-specific fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Employing GPT-4o, a cutting-edge large language model, we explore sentiment dynamics... Leveraging few-shot learning with GPT-4o, the latest advanced model..."
  - [section] "Leveraging few-shot learning, the GPT-4o model underwent training using labeled examples to achieve precise comment classification."
- Break condition: If the labeled examples are too domain-specific or the tweet language is highly colloquial, the model's generalization may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sentiment categories (hope, regret, prediction) correlate with observable market behavior in cryptocurrency discussions.
- Mechanism: Users' expressed sentiments in tweets reflect their investment intentions and risk perceptions, which in turn influence market sentiment and potential price movements.
- Core assumption: Social media discourse meaningfully captures investor sentiment that affects cryptocurrency markets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in predictive sentiments, with Matic demonstrating a notably higher propensity for optimistic predictions."
  - [section] "The data suggests that predictive sentiments, such as 'Predictive Incremental' or 'Predictive Decremental,' significantly influence the overall emotional landscape."
- Break condition: If market movements are driven more by technical factors than social sentiment, the correlation weakens.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Balanced inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores validate the reliability of sentiment classification.
- Mechanism: Moderate IAA scores (e.g., 0.7173% for Predictive statement detection) indicate that human annotators consistently apply the classification scheme, supporting model reliability.
- Core assumption: IAA scores are a valid proxy for classification reliability when using few-shot learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study achieved moderate inter-annotator agreement scores (0.4393% for Hope detection, 0.5796% for Regret detection, and 0.7173% for Predictive statement detection), suggesting reasonable reliability in the classification results."
  - [section] "Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) is used to evaluate the extent of consensus among annotators... A random sample of 1,000 comments was selected, and the following results were obtained: 0.4393% for Hope detection..."
- Break condition: If IAA scores are artificially inflated by overly simple categories or if the sample size is too small.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot learning in NLP
  - Why needed here: The study uses few-shot learning with GPT-4o to classify tweets without extensive retraining.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of few-shot learning over traditional fine-tuning for this task?

- Concept: Sentiment analysis in social media
  - Why needed here: Understanding how sentiment detection methods apply to cryptocurrency discourse on platforms like X.
  - Quick check question: How does sentiment analysis differ when applied to financial vs. general social media content?

- Concept: Inter-annotator agreement metrics
  - Why needed here: IAA scores (e.g., Cohen's Kappa) are used to validate the reliability of sentiment classification.
  - Quick check question: Why might a moderate IAA score still be considered acceptable in sentiment analysis tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Preprocessing -> Few-shot prompt engineering -> GPT-4o classification -> IAA validation -> Analysis
- Critical path: Preprocessing and prompt engineering directly affect classification accuracy; errors here propagate downstream.
- Design tradeoffs: Few-shot learning saves resources but may sacrifice precision compared to full fine-tuning; IAA scores may be inflated by simple categories.
- Failure signatures: Low IAA scores, high variance in classification outputs, or failure to capture domain-specific slang.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test classification accuracy on a held-out validation set with known labels.
  2. Vary the number and quality of few-shot examples to assess sensitivity.
  3. Compare GPT-4o outputs with a simpler baseline (e.g., keyword matching) to benchmark performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the correlation between cryptocurrency price fluctuations and sentiment analysis outcomes, and how accurate are GPT-4o predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "For future research, we intend to expand the dataset size and assess the correlation between cryptocurrency price fluctuations and sentiment analysis outcomes at the data collection juncture. Additionally, we aim to ascertain the accuracy percentage of GPT-4o predictions."
- Why unresolved: The study did not analyze the correlation between sentiment analysis results and actual price movements, nor did it evaluate the predictive accuracy of GPT-4o.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study analyzing historical price data alongside sentiment analysis results, with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for GPT-4o's predictive performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the sentiment distribution across different cryptocurrencies change over time, and what factors drive these changes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study analyzed a static dataset of tweets from a specific time period. Cryptocurrency markets are dynamic, and sentiment can shift rapidly based on news, events, and market trends.
- Why unresolved: The study only provides a snapshot of sentiment at a single point in time. Longitudinal analysis is needed to understand sentiment evolution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A time-series analysis of sentiment across multiple time periods, correlating sentiment shifts with external events, news, and market data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different demographic groups (e.g., age, location, experience) express hope, regret, and predictive sentiments in cryptocurrency discussions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study did not analyze demographic information of the Twitter users. Different groups may have varying levels of risk tolerance, investment strategies, and emotional responses.
- Why unresolved: The dataset did not include demographic metadata, and the study did not explore sentiment variations across different user groups.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study collecting demographic data alongside sentiment analysis, allowing for comparison of sentiment patterns across different user segments.

## Limitations
- The study's reliance on few-shot learning with GPT-4o introduces uncertainty regarding the robustness of classification results
- Inter-annotator agreement scores are quite low for some categories (e.g., 0.4393% for hope detection), raising questions about classification reliability
- The temporal scope (September 2021 - March 2023) may not capture longer-term sentiment trends in the dynamic cryptocurrency market

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Data collection and preprocessing methodology is clearly outlined; GPT-4o few-shot learning approach is reasonable given model capabilities
- **Medium Confidence:** Classification results and IAA scores are reported, but low IAA scores for some categories raise reliability concerns
- **Low Confidence:** Claim that sentiment categories correlate with market behavior is weakly supported without direct evidence linking sentiment to price movements

## Next Checks
1. Validate classification accuracy by testing few-shot learning approach on a held-out validation set with known labels
2. Analyze IAA score sensitivity by varying the number and quality of few-shot examples to determine robustness
3. Expand cryptocurrency coverage by replicating analysis with a larger and more diverse set of cryptocurrencies to test pattern consistency
