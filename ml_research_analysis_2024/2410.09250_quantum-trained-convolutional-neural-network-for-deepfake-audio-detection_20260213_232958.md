# Quantum-Trained Convolutional Neural Network for Deepfake Audio Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.09250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09250
- Authors: Chu-Hsuan Abraham Lin; Chen-Yu Liu; Samuel Yen-Chi Chen; Kuan-Cheng Chen

- Primary result: Quantum-trained CNN achieves up to 70% parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy for deepfake audio detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Quantum-Trained Convolutional Neural Network (QT-CNN) framework that integrates Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with classical CNN architectures for deepfake audio detection. The hybrid approach uses quantum optimization during training to enhance model expressiveness while enabling efficient classical inference. By employing a novel quantum-to-classical parameter mapping, the method achieves significant parameter reduction (up to 70%) without compromising detection accuracy. The framework demonstrates practical integration of quantum computing into AI for deepfake detection, offering a scalable approach that reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.

## Method Summary
The QT-CNN framework combines quantum and classical components through a hybrid training approach. Audio features including MFCCs, chroma STFT, spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, roll-off frequency, and zero-crossing rate are extracted from the DEEP-VOICE dataset. These features are preprocessed using MinMaxScaler and stratified splitting. The quantum component consists of N-qubit QNNs with parameterized Ry gates and CNOT entanglement, repeated in configurable blocks (12-96). A quantum-to-classical mapping model (301 parameters) transforms quantum measurement probabilities to classical parameters, which are then scaled (8 parameters) before being used in the classical CNN layers (2 convolutional + 2 fully connected). The system is trained using cross-entropy loss, with quantum optimization during training and classical inference at deployment.

## Key Results
- QT-CNN achieves up to 70% parameter reduction compared to classical CNNs while maintaining comparable accuracy
- The framework maintains high accuracy across varying QNN block configurations (12-96 blocks)
- Performance remains stable across different deepfake audio samples in the DEEP-VOICE dataset
- The hybrid approach enables efficient inference on classical hardware while benefiting from quantum optimization during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The quantum-to-classical parameter mapping enables parameter reduction by leveraging quantum state probabilities instead of direct parameter representation.
- Mechanism: Instead of storing M classical parameters, an N-qubit quantum state represents the same information through 2^N probability amplitudes, reducing the parameter count from M to O(polylog(M)).
- Core assumption: The quantum state probabilities can be mapped to classical parameters without significant loss of representational capacity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method incorporates a novel quantum-to-classical parameter mapping that effectively utilizes quantum states to enhance the expressive power of the model, achieving up to 70% parameter reduction"
  - [section] "We begin by defining a classical NN characterized by the parameter vector ⃗θ = ( θ1, θ2, . . . , θM ). A quantum state |ψ⟩ is encoded using N = ⌈log2 M ⌉ qubits"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hybrid quantum-classical training allows quantum optimization benefits while maintaining classical inference compatibility.
- Mechanism: Quantum neural networks optimize the CNN weights during training through quantum state evolution, but the final model uses classical weights that can be deployed on standard hardware.
- Core assumption: The quantum optimization during training produces better or equivalent weight initialization/optimization compared to classical methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The QT-CNN employs a hybrid quantum-classical approach, integrating Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with classical neural architectures to optimize training efficiency"
  - [section] "The QT framework involves constructing an N-qubit QNN with parameterized Ry gates in blocks, repeatable nblock times to enhance capacity"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The parameter reduction maintains accuracy by preserving the most relevant information through quantum state encoding.
- Mechanism: The quantum state encoding captures the essential parameter relationships more efficiently than classical representation, allowing 70% reduction without accuracy loss.
- Core assumption: The quantum Hilbert space representation preserves the information content needed for effective deepfake detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "achieving up to 70% parameter reduction compared to classical models without compromising accuracy"
  - [section] "Experimental results demonstrate that the QT-CNN achieves comparable performance to traditional CNNs, maintaining high accuracy during training and testing phases"

  - Quick check question: What role do convolutional layers play in extracting audio features from spectrograms or MFCCs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: QNN blocks (parameterized Ry gates with CNOT entanglement) → Mapping model (301 parameters) → Scaling model (8 parameters) → Classical CNN layers (2 convolutional + 2 fully connected)
- Critical path: Audio feature extraction → Quantum parameter optimization → Classical CNN inference → Classification decision
- Design tradeoffs: Parameter reduction (70%) vs. potential quantum hardware access limitations vs. classical inference efficiency
- Failure signatures: Accuracy degradation below baseline CNN, quantum simulation errors, parameter mapping instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare baseline CNN accuracy on DEEP-VOICE dataset with varying QNN block counts (12, 48, 96)
  2. Measure parameter count reduction at each QNN block configuration
  3. Test inference latency and resource usage on classical hardware vs. baseline CNN
