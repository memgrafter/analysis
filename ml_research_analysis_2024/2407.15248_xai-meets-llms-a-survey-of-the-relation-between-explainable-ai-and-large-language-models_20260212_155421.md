# XAI meets LLMs: A Survey of the Relation between Explainable AI and Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.15248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15248
- Reference count: 18
- One-line primary result: Systematic mapping study identifies gap in XAI methods for LLM interpretability, calling for increased focus on explainability in LLM development

## Executive Summary
This survey examines the intersection of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting the need for transparency and interpretability in these complex systems. The authors conducted a systematic mapping study, reviewing 35 papers from peer-reviewed and preprint sources to categorize current approaches to explaining LLMs. They found that while most research focuses on using LLMs to enhance task performance, fewer studies directly address the challenges of making LLMs interpretable. The survey identifies a gap in the literature regarding the development of explanation methods for LLM-based systems and calls for increased attention to explainability as an integral part of LLM development.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic mapping study using a custom methodology combining peer-reviewed papers from Q1 AI journals (2022) and preprints from arXiv (2010-2023). They applied keyword-based filtering with logical OR within XAI and LLM term lists and AND between lists, followed by manual vetting to remove false positives. Papers were categorized into "Application" (using LLMs for explanation or as a feature) and "Discussion" (issues or benchmarks), with final selection based on citation metrics. The survey included both established knowledge and cutting-edge developments by incorporating preprint sources alongside traditional academic publications.

## Key Results
- Survey identifies significant research gap in XAI methods specifically designed for LLM interpretability
- Most current research uses XAI techniques to enhance LLM performance rather than explain LLM internal mechanisms
- Authors call for explainability to be integrated as a core component of LLM development rather than an afterthought

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's dual inclusion of peer-reviewed and preprint papers captures both established knowledge and cutting-edge developments in XAI-LLM research.
- Mechanism: By combining traditional academic sources (peer-reviewed journals) with rapidly evolving preprint repositories (arXiv), the survey provides a comprehensive overview that includes both validated research and emerging trends.
- Core assumption: The field of XAI-LLM research is rapidly evolving, making preprint inclusion essential for capturing the latest developments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Recognizing the rapid development in LLM research, our survey includes both peer-reviewed and preprint (arXiv) papers, offering a comprehensive overview of XAI's role in LLM research."
  - [section III-A]: "Following Mart ́ınez-G ́arate et al. [2023], we designed our SMS for XAI and LLMs, including peer-reviewed and preprint papers. The latter choice is because we believe in rapidly evolving fields like computer science, including preprints offering access to the latest research, essential for a comprehensive review Oikonomidi et al. [2020]."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The survey's categorization framework provides a structured way to understand the relationship between XAI and LLMs.
- Mechanism: By dividing papers into Application papers (those that generate explanations or use LLM explanations as features) and Discussion papers (those that address issues or provide benchmarks), the survey creates a clear taxonomy of the field.
- Core assumption: A structured categorization helps researchers and practitioners navigate the complex landscape of XAI-LLM research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We introduce a novel categorisation framework for assessing the body of research concerning the explainability of LLMs."
  - [section IV]: "We divide papers into two macro-categories of Application papers... and Discussion papers..."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey's focus on both the performance-enhancing and interpretability aspects of XAI-LLM integration provides a balanced perspective on the field.
- Mechanism: By examining how XAI techniques are used to improve LLM performance and how they contribute to model interpretability, the survey captures the dual nature of the XAI-LLM relationship.
- Core assumption: A comprehensive understanding of XAI-LLM integration requires examining both its practical applications and its theoretical implications for model transparency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We examine the dual paths in current LLM research and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): enhancing performance through XAI and the emerging focus on model interpretability."
  - [section II]: "In XAI field, the intersection with LLMs presents unique challenges and opportunities."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Systematic Mapping Studies (SMS)
  - Why needed here: The survey methodology relies on SMS to provide a comprehensive overview of the XAI-LLM field, which is crucial for understanding the current state of research and identifying gaps.
  - Quick check question: How does an SMS differ from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in terms of scope and depth?

- Concept: eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques
  - Why needed here: Understanding XAI techniques is essential for grasping how they are applied to LLMs and what challenges arise in making these models interpretable.
  - Quick check question: What are the main categories of XAI techniques, and how might they be applied differently to traditional ML models versus LLMs?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Why needed here: A solid understanding of LLM architecture and capabilities is crucial for appreciating the specific challenges in making them interpretable and the potential of XAI techniques in this context.
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural components of LLMs that contribute to their "black box" nature and pose challenges for interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Literature collection: DBLP for peer-reviewed papers, arXiv for preprints
  Filtering: Keyword-based search combining XAI and LLM terms
  Categorization: Application papers (To Explain, As Feature) and Discussion papers (Issues, Benchmark and Metrics)
  Analysis: Citation-based selection, tool engagement assessment

- Critical path:
  1. Define research questions and methodology
  2. Collect literature from multiple sources
  3. Filter and select relevant papers
  4. Categorize papers based on their contribution
  5. Analyze results and identify trends and gaps

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth: Including preprints provides more coverage but may include less vetted research
  - Manual vs. automated filtering: Manual review ensures relevance but is time-consuming
  - Categorization granularity: More categories provide better organization but may complicate analysis

- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete coverage: Missing key papers due to limited keyword selection or database access
  - Biased representation: Overrepresentation of certain types of studies due to citation-based selection
  - Outdated information: Preprints not being updated to final published versions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the keyword filtering process on a small sample of known relevant papers to ensure comprehensive coverage
  2. Conduct a pilot categorization on a subset of papers to validate the effectiveness of the chosen framework
  3. Analyze the distribution of papers across categories and sources to identify potential biases or gaps in the literature collection process

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can XAI methods be specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of LLM interpretability, such as their emergent behaviors and complex internal mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify a gap in the literature regarding the development of explanation methods for LLM-based systems and emphasize the need for XAI methods that can handle the complexity and opacity of LLMs.
- Why unresolved: Current XAI methods are often designed for simpler models and may not be effective in providing meaningful explanations for LLMs due to their unique characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating the effectiveness of novel XAI methods specifically designed for LLMs, validated through rigorous evaluation and user studies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective ways to present LLM explanations to non-technical stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability without overwhelming them with technical details?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors emphasize the importance of balancing performance improvements with efforts to clarify the underlying mechanisms of LLMs and ensuring that these models are transparent and accountable. They also mention the need for developing approaches that render explanations more accessible and understandable to a wider audience.
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of research on how to effectively communicate complex LLM explanations to non-technical stakeholders, and the optimal level of detail and presentation format remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing different explanation presentation methods and their impact on stakeholder understanding, trust, and decision-making, as well as guidelines for designing effective LLM explanation interfaces.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the development of LLM explanation methods be integrated into the model development process to ensure that explainability is considered from the outset, rather than as an afterthought?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest that explainability should be elevated from a mere 'nice-to-have' feature to an integral aspect of the development process, and they emphasize the need for a proactive approach to incorporate explainability in the design and implementation phases of LLM-based systems.
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of established best practices and frameworks for integrating explainability considerations into the LLM development lifecycle, and the trade-offs between model performance and explainability remain poorly understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research on the development of LLM explanation methods that are tightly coupled with the model architecture and training process, as well as empirical studies on the impact of early explainability integration on model performance and stakeholder trust.

## Limitations

- The survey's reliance on citation-based paper selection may overlook emerging research areas and introduce bias toward established work
- Focus on English-language peer-reviewed and preprint sources may miss relevant work published through other channels or languages
- Limited representation of industry applications versus academic research in the selected papers

## Confidence

- High: General categorization framework and identification of research gaps
- Medium: Completeness of literature coverage due to selective citation-based selection process
- Medium: Assessment of tool engagement metrics relying on publicly available repository statistics

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the literature collection process using alternative keyword combinations and databases to assess the robustness of the identified research landscape
2. Conduct a citation network analysis to verify if the selected papers truly represent the most influential work in the field
3. Perform a longitudinal analysis of tool engagement metrics to determine if initial adoption patterns persist over time or if newer tools are gaining traction
