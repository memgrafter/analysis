# Harnessing Transfer Learning from Swahili: Advancing Solutions for Comorian Dialects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12143
- Reference count: 24
- ASR WER: 39.50%, CER: 13.76%; MT ROUGE-1: 0.6826, ROUGE-2: 0.42, ROUGE-L: 0.6532

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of developing NLP technologies for extremely low-resource languages, specifically Comorian dialects, by leveraging transfer learning from Swahili. The authors hypothesize that lexical similarities between these Bantu languages can enable effective knowledge transfer. They construct datasets by combining filtered Swahili corpora with local Comorian data, focusing on lexical proximity to ensure relevance. Using a transfer learning approach, they develop and fine-tune models for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT), achieving functional but imperfect performance metrics.

## Method Summary
The approach uses transfer learning from Swahili to Comorian by first calculating lexical distances using Levenshtein distance on Swadesh lists, then filtering Swahili corpora to retain sentences with high lexical similarity (>80%). For MT, the filtered Swahili sentences are translated to English and combined with existing Comorian-French/English data for fine-tuning mT5-small. For ASR, Whisper-small is fine-tuned on filtered Swahili CommonVoice audio data. The construction process involves pseudo-labeling with lexical filtering to create usable datasets for these extremely low-resource languages.

## Key Results
- ASR model achieved WER of 39.50% and CER of 13.76%
- MT model recorded ROUGE-1: 0.6826, ROUGE-2: 0.42, ROUGE-L: 0.6532
- Transfer learning approach successfully adapted pre-trained multilingual models to Comorian with limited data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Lexical similarity between Swahili and Comorian enables effective transfer learning
- Mechanism: The system leverages shared Bantu language roots to transfer linguistic patterns from Swahili (high-resource) to Comorian (low-resource). By calculating lexical distances using Levenshtein distance on Swadesh lists, the model identifies and prioritizes Swahili data closest to Comorian vocabulary.
- Core assumption: Languages with high lexical similarity will have compatible linguistic structures for transfer learning to be effective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We only focus on elements that are closest to Comorian by calculating lexical distances between candidate and source data"
  - [section 3.2] "We construct an expanded Swadesh list comprising 207 words for each ShiKomori dialect as well as for Swahili... We use French as our pivot language to align Swahili terms with their corresponding ShiKomori equivalents"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only 25 related papers found with average FMR of 0.485, suggesting limited existing research on this specific transfer approach
- Break condition: If lexical distance exceeds a critical threshold (approximately 50% based on table values), transfer learning effectiveness degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pseudo-labeling with lexical filtering creates usable datasets for low-resource languages
- Mechanism: The system generates synthetic training data by filtering large Swahili corpora for sentences containing Comorian vocabulary (80%+ match), then translates these sentences to create parallel corpora for MT and ASR training.
- Core assumption: Filtering large general corpora for lexical similarity is more efficient than manual data collection for low-resource languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1.1] "The construction of the dataset involves several steps... we retain sentences with at least 80% Comorian words"
  - [section 4.1.2] "we identify texts in the CommonVoice dataset where at least 80% of the words contain at least one Comorian word with a Levenshtein distance of 80% or more"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in related papers for this specific pseudo-labeling approach
- Break condition: If filtered data represents less than 5% of source corpus, the approach becomes impractical due to insufficient data volume.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning pre-trained multilingual models on filtered data produces functional NLP systems
- Mechanism: The system starts with mT5 and Whisper models pre-trained on multilingual data, then fine-tunes them on the filtered Swahili-Comorian datasets to create specialized models for MT and ASR.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained multilingual models contain transferable representations that can be adapted to closely related low-resource languages with limited fine-tuning data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2.1] "Following a similar approach, we fine-tune a pre-trained MT model"
  - [section 4.2.2] "Whisper employs an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture for speech recognition"
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - no direct citations to similar fine-tuning approaches for Comorian or closely related low-resource languages
- Break condition: If fine-tuning data is insufficient to update model parameters effectively, performance may degrade rather than improve.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bantu language family characteristics and Guthrie's classification
  - Why needed here: Understanding the shared linguistic features of Bantu languages explains why transfer learning between Swahili and Comorian is feasible
  - Quick check question: What are the key phonological and lexical similarities between languages in Guthrie's group G that enable transfer learning?

- Concept: Lexical distance metrics and their interpretation
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on Levenshtein distance calculations on Swadesh lists to quantify language similarity and guide data filtering
  - Quick check question: How does a Levenshtein distance of 40% between two words relate to their practical mutual intelligibility?

- Concept: Transfer learning methodology and fine-tuning strategies
  - Why needed here: The approach requires understanding how to adapt pre-trained models to new languages with limited data
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches when adapting multilingual models to low-resource languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Swahili corpus → Lexical distance calculator → Data filter → Pseudo-labeling → MT/ ASR model → Evaluation metrics (ROUGE, WER, CER)
- Critical path: Swahili corpus → Lexical filtering → Pseudo-labeling → Model fine-tuning → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Data quality vs. quantity: Filtering for high lexical similarity reduces available data but improves relevance
  - Model complexity vs. resource constraints: Using smaller model checkpoints due to GPU limitations
  - Manual effort vs. automation: Pseudo-labeling reduces human annotation costs but may introduce errors
- Failure signatures:
  - High lexical distance values (>50%) indicate poor transfer learning potential
  - Low ROUGE scores suggest inadequate MT performance despite transfer learning
  - High WER/CER values indicate ASR model struggles with language-specific phonetic patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Calculate lexical distances between Comorian dialects and multiple potential source languages (not just Swahili) to identify optimal transfer candidates
  2. Test different lexical filtering thresholds (70%, 80%, 90%) to find optimal balance between data quantity and quality
  3. Compare fine-tuning strategies (full fine-tuning vs. adapter-based approaches) to maximize performance with limited GPU resources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Comorian NLP models compare when using transfer learning from Swahili versus other Bantu languages with similar lexical distances?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using Swahili as a candidate language due to lexical proximity, but does not compare against other Bantu languages.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses solely on Swahili as the source language for transfer learning, without exploring alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using transfer learning from other Bantu languages with similar lexical distances and comparing the performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of dialectal variation within Comorian on the performance of the NLP models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges dialectal diversity within Comorian but treats it as a whole due to data constraints.
- Why unresolved: The models are trained on mixed Comorian data without considering individual dialectal differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating separate models for each Comorian dialect and comparing their performance to the mixed dialect model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the error rates in the ASR model be further reduced through fine-tuning or architectural changes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The ASR model achieves a WER of 39.50% and CER of 13.76%, indicating room for improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore advanced fine-tuning techniques or alternative architectures to improve ASR performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating different fine-tuning strategies, data augmentation techniques, or more complex model architectures on the ASR task.

## Limitations

- Performance metrics indicate functional but not production-ready models (39.50% WER, 13.76% CER, ROUGE scores below 0.7)
- Approach relies heavily on lexical similarity which may not generalize to language pairs with different typological relationships
- Pseudo-labeling introduces potential error propagation from the translation step
- Does not address dialectal variations within Comorian itself

## Confidence

- Transfer learning effectiveness between closely related Bantu languages: Medium-High
- Pseudo-labeling approach for dataset construction: Medium
- Model performance metrics and their interpretation: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test the transfer learning approach with additional Bantu language pairs (e.g., Kikuyu-Swahili or Zulu-Swahili) to verify if lexical similarity thresholds remain consistent across different language combinations.

2. Conduct ablation studies varying the lexical filtering threshold (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) to quantify the tradeoff between data quantity and model performance, particularly examining whether the 80% threshold is optimal or could be relaxed.

3. Evaluate model robustness across different Comorian dialects to assess whether the approach generalizes within the target language family or if dialect-specific fine-tuning is required for practical deployment.
