# Analyzing Large Language Models for Classroom Discussion Assessment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.08680
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08680
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Binary Counting approach with 10-shot examples achieved highest performance (QWK up to 0.77) for classroom discussion assessment

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how task formulation, context length, and few-shot examples affect large language models' performance in assessing classroom discussion quality. Using 112 transcripts scored by the Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA), researchers tested Mistral and Vicuna models across four IQA dimensions. The findings reveal that counting-based approaches and binary classification significantly outperform direct scoring, with shorter contexts generally improving results and few-shot examples providing substantial benefits for certain approaches.

## Method Summary
The study used 112 classroom discussion transcripts from English Language Arts classes, scored on four IQA dimensions using the Instructional Quality Assessment rubric. Researchers implemented four task formulation approaches (Direct Score, Direct Counting, Extractive Counting, Binary Counting) with both zero-shot and few-shot prompting using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Vicuna-7b-v1.5-16K models. They tested different context lengths (full transcripts vs. 1k tokens) and evaluated performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), computational efficiency, and consistency across multiple runs.

## Key Results
- Task formulation was most influential factor: counting-based approaches and binary classification outperformed direct scoring
- Shorter context length generally improved LLM performance
- Few-shot examples significantly boosted performance for counting and binary classification approaches but not for direct scoring
- Binary Counting approach with 10-shot examples achieved highest performance (QWK up to 0.77)
- LLMs were more consistent predicting extreme scores (1 and 4) than middle scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task formulation significantly impacts LLM performance in classroom discussion assessment.
- Mechanism: Different prompting approaches lead to varying performance levels based on how well each formulation aligns with the LLM's reasoning capabilities.
- Core assumption: LLMs can be effectively guided through carefully crafted prompts that leverage their strengths in different types of reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Results showed that task formulation was most influential: counting-based approaches (Direct Counting, Extractive Counting) and binary classification (Binary Counting) outperformed direct scoring.
  - DC's variants outperform DS-full-0s, suggesting that the LLM cannot fully infer the relation between the counts of IQA observation and the final scores.
  - Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.397, average citations=0.0.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Context length affects LLM performance, with shorter contexts generally improving results.
- Mechanism: Breaking long transcripts into smaller chunks improves performance by reducing cognitive load and potential for error in processing extensive context.
- Core assumption: LLMs have limitations in processing long-range context that can be mitigated by reducing input size.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Shorter context length generally improved performance.
  - Context Length Factor. While previous work experimenting with LLMs on classroom discussion used short transcripts... our transcripts are generally much longer... Therefore, we test whether giving the LLM a shorter context such as an excerpt instead of the entire transcript leads to a change in performance.
  - Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.397, average citations=0.0.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Few-shot examples significantly boost LLM performance for counting and binary classification approaches but not for direct scoring.
- Mechanism: Providing examples helps the LLM understand the task better and learn patterns that improve its ability to perform counting and binary classification tasks.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively learn from few-shot examples, especially when the task involves specific patterns or reasoning steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Few-shot examples significantly boosted performance for counting and binary classification approaches but not for direct scoring.
  - For EC, the provided answers increase performance because the examples help the LLM better identify similar turns for scoring the IQA. For BC, the direct guidance from examples (yes/no) provides patterns (positive/negative) that the LLMs can absorb and generalize.
  - Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.397, average citations=0.0.

## Foundational Learning

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Understanding LLMs is crucial because the study relies on their capabilities for automated assessment of classroom discussions.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between LLMs and traditional NLP models like BERT?

- **Task Formulation in Prompt Engineering**: Different task formulations significantly impact LLM performance, so understanding how to craft effective prompts is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the task formulation influence the LLM's ability to perform a given task?

- **Few-Shot Learning**: Few-shot examples are used to improve LLM performance, so understanding how LLMs learn from limited examples is important.
  - Quick check question: What is few-shot learning, and how does it differ from zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLM models (Mistral, Vicuna) -> prompts for task formulation -> context length management -> few-shot examples -> IQA scoring
- **Critical path**: Creating prompts -> processing transcripts to appropriate context length -> selecting and formatting few-shot examples -> running LLM to generate scores
- **Design tradeoffs**: Shorter context lengths improve performance but may lose long-range context; few-shot examples boost performance but add complexity; binary counting is more accurate but slower than other methods
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance in Direct Score approaches, inconsistent results across runs, long inference times for Binary Counting
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare performance of Direct Score, Direct Counting, Extractive Counting, and Binary Counting approaches
  2. Test effect of different context lengths (full transcript vs. 1k tokens) on LLM performance
  3. Evaluate impact of few-shot examples on counting and binary classification approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **How do findings generalize to other classroom discussion corpora and assessment schemes?**
   - Basis: Authors state "We would also like to examine how our findings generalize to other classroom discussion corpora and assessment schemes in future research."
   - Why unresolved: Study used specific dataset from Texas district with particular demographics
   - What evidence would resolve it: Similar experiments on diverse classroom discussion datasets from different subjects, grade levels, and demographic backgrounds

2. **What is the impact of fine-tuning large language models on their performance?**
   - Basis: Authors mention "fine-tuning the LLMs, which has not been explored in this study, is a potential way to increase the performance further."
   - Why unresolved: Study only used zero-shot and few-shot approaches with pre-trained LLMs
   - What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with fine-tuning different LLM architectures on the classroom discussion dataset

3. **How can consistency of large language models in predicting classroom discussion quality scores be improved?**
   - Basis: Authors state "We leave further analyses to identify the problems of inconsistency for future work."
   - Why unresolved: While study found LLMs more consistent with extreme scores, underlying reasons for inconsistency were not explored
   - What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing LLM outputs to identify patterns leading to inconsistent predictions and developing mitigation strategies

## Limitations

- Dataset Scope: Study uses 112 transcripts from a single Texas district, limiting generalizability to other contexts, grade levels, or subject areas
- Model Selection: Only two open-source models (Mistral and Vicuna) with 7B parameters were tested, potentially missing performance differences with larger or different architectures
- Context Reduction Trade-offs: Analysis doesn't fully quantify what qualitative information might be lost when truncating transcripts to 1k tokens

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Task formulation as most influential factor - well-supported by consistent patterns across multiple experiments and both models
- **Medium Confidence**: Context length effects - clear trend but complex interaction with other factors
- **Medium Confidence**: Few-shot learning effectiveness - differential impact across task formulations well-documented but mechanism remains somewhat speculative

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Context Validation**: Test same task formulations on transcripts from different grade levels, subjects, or educational contexts to assess generalizability beyond the Texas ELA dataset

2. **Larger Model Comparison**: Evaluate whether observed patterns hold with larger or more capable models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to determine if task formulation insights are model-agnostic

3. **Long-Range Dependency Analysis**: Systematically evaluate what information is lost when truncating to 1k tokens by comparing LLM assessments on full transcripts versus 1k chunks
