# Mmm whatcha say? Uncovering distal and proximal context effects in first and second-language word perception using psychophysical reverse correlation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05515
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05515
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Reverse correlation revealed conflicting proximal congruent and distal contrastive effects of pitch and speech rate on vowel perception in both L1 and L2 speakers.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how pitch and speech rate in surrounding context influence vowel perception in both first (L1) and second (L2) language speakers. Using psychophysical reverse correlation, the authors systematically manipulated prosodic cues in phrases containing English (/i/-/I/) and French (/u/-/y/) vowel contrasts. By reconstructing the acoustic profiles that bias perception of these sounds, they uncovered that vowel perception is shaped by conflicting effects: a congruent proximal effect 200-300ms before the target and a distal contrastive effect up to 1s prior. Remarkably, L1 and L2 speakers exhibited strikingly similar prosodic profiles in perception.

## Method Summary
The authors used psychophysical reverse correlation to investigate acoustic context effects. They created ambiguous target words by modifying F1/F2 formants of /i/-/I/ and /u/-/y/ using PRAAT, validated ambiguity with Whisper ASR, and embedded them in base phrases. CLEESE toolbox generated 250 stimuli per participant with random pitch (±100 cents) and duration (±1%) transformations in 100ms windows. Participants completed 1-interval, 2-alternative forced choice trials, and reverse correlation kernels were computed to reveal how acoustic context influenced vowel categorization.

## Key Results
- Vowel perception shows conflicting proximal congruent (200-300ms pre-target) and distal contrastive (up to 1s pre-target) effects of pitch and speech rate
- L1 and L2 speakers exhibited remarkably similar prosodic profiles in perception
- Context effects become congruent proximal to the target, with a tipping point around 200-300ms pre-target
- French L1 speakers showed weaker and less consistent pitch effects compared to speech rate effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Psychophysical reverse correlation reliably reconstructs perceptual weighting of acoustic cues from response data
- Mechanism: By systematically manipulating pitch and speech rate in multi-windowed stimuli, the method uses trial-by-trial listener responses to compute classification images (kernels) that reveal how acoustic context influences vowel categorization
- Core assumption: Listeners' responses reflect consistent internal representations of acoustic context effects that can be extracted statistically from random stimulus variations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we systematically varied the pitch and speech rate in phrases around different pairs of vowels... thus reconstructing, in a data-driven manner, the prosodic profiles that bias their perception."
  - [section] "reverse correlation offers several key advantages... it allows for uncovering the precise chronometry of context effects and aligning cues with specific phrase elements."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on other acoustic domains (tone, pitch contours) but don't directly validate the reverse correlation method for vowel perception

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vowel perception is shaped by conflicting proximal congruent and distal contrastive effects of pitch and speech rate
- Mechanism: The kernel analysis revealed a proximal effect 200-300ms before the target that biases perception congruently (e.g., faster rate before /y/ increases /y/ responses), while distal effects up to 1s prior show contrastive influence (e.g., slower rate earlier biases toward faster alternatives)
- Core assumption: Context effects operate over multiple temporal windows with opposing influences that can be separated and measured through reverse correlation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "vowel perception is in fact influenced by conflicting effects from the surrounding pitch and speech rate: a congruent proximal effect 0.2s pre-target and a distal contrastive effect up to 1s before."
  - [section] "we found that contrastive context effects became congruent proximal to the target, with a tipping point around 200-300ms pre-target."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss pitch and rate in different contexts (tone, speech synthesis) but don't provide direct evidence for the specific proximal/distal conflict pattern

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: L1 and L2 speakers show remarkably similar prosodic profiles in vowel perception
- Mechanism: Despite differences in language background and phonetic inventory, both native and non-native speakers demonstrated comparable patterns of context effects in their reverse correlation kernels, suggesting shared perceptual mechanisms
- Core assumption: Acoustic context effects in speech perception are largely language-independent and can be recruited similarly by L1 and L2 speakers
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "found that L1 and L2 speakers exhibited strikingly similar prosodic profiles in perception."
  - [section] "This pattern of result was remarkably conserved in L2 speakers" (referring to both French and English contexts)
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't directly address cross-linguistic similarity in acoustic context effects

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reverse correlation methodology
  - Why needed here: The entire experimental design and analysis depends on understanding how systematic random perturbations in acoustic stimuli can be used to reconstruct perceptual weighting functions from behavioral responses
  - Quick check question: How does reverse correlation differ from traditional factorial designs in speech perception research?

- Concept: Temporal dynamics of acoustic context effects
  - Why needed here: Interpreting the results requires understanding how proximal versus distal acoustic context can have opposing influences on perception, and the timescales over which these effects operate
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between proximal congruent effects and distal contrastive effects in acoustic context?

- Concept: Second language speech perception
  - Why needed here: The study's comparison of L1 and L2 speakers requires knowledge of how non-native listeners process acoustic cues and whether they recruit the same perceptual mechanisms as native speakers
  - Quick check question: What factors might lead L2 speakers to process acoustic context differently from L1 speakers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base word selection -> Formant manipulation -> Phrase embedding -> Pitch/rate randomization -> 1-interval 2AFC trials -> Kernel computation -> Statistical testing -> Visualization
- Critical path: Base ambiguous word creation → systematic acoustic manipulation → participant response collection → reverse correlation kernel computation → statistical comparison of L1/L2 patterns
- Design tradeoffs:
  - 1-interval vs 2-interval design: shorter experiments but potential response bias vs longer experiments with cleaner phonetic data
  - Number of manipulation windows: more windows provide better temporal resolution but reduce the magnitude of each manipulation
  - Manipulation range: larger ranges increase effect sizes but may produce unnatural stimuli
- Failure signatures:
  - Non-significant kernels across all conditions suggesting insufficient signal or inappropriate manipulation parameters
  - Inconsistent patterns between word and phrase tasks suggesting methodological issues
  - Large response bias indicating problems with the forced-choice design
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run analysis with only proximal windows (0-400ms) to verify the congruent effect pattern
  2. Run analysis with only distal windows (400-1200ms) to isolate the contrastive effect
  3. Compare kernel patterns when using different manipulation distributions (e.g., uniform vs normal) to test robustness of the results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific acoustic cues beyond pitch and speech rate contribute to L2 vowel perception, and how do they interact with prosodic context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their methodology could include additional audiovisual cues like formant manipulation and orofacial gestures, but these were not tested in the current study
- Why unresolved: The study only examined pitch and speech rate, leaving other potential cues unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: A reverse-correlation study manipulating formants, duration, and visual cues simultaneously while measuring L1/L2 perception differences

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do individual differences in language learning experience and proficiency affect the weight given to proximal vs distal contextual cues in vowel perception?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found remarkably similar prosodic profiles between L1 and L2 speakers but suggest examining possible individual differences in cue combination
- Why unresolved: The study grouped participants by L1/L2 status but didn't analyze individual variation within groups
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of individual kernel patterns correlating with self-reported proficiency scores and language learning history

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do French L1 speakers show weaker and less consistent pitch effects compared to speech rate effects in vowel perception?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note this pattern specifically and suggest it may relate to French not being a language with lexically specified word stress
- Why unresolved: The current study cannot distinguish between this lexical stress hypothesis and potential methodological artifacts from the chosen phrase stimuli
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication with multiple French phrases varying in consonant density and comparison with English stress-timed phrases

### Open Question 4
- Question: What causes the unexpected pitch preference for /I/ over /i/ in English L1 speakers that contradicts theoretical predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found English L1 speakers showed increased pitch preference for /I/ despite theoretical predictions of higher pitch for /i/
- Why unresolved: The study speculates this could relate to spectral cue weighting but doesn't test this mechanism
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments manipulating spectral cue salience while measuring pitch kernel changes, or individual difference analysis of cue weighting strategies

### Open Question 5
- Question: How do the proximal congruent and distal contrastive effects interact temporally in speech perception, and what determines their relative strength?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found both effects exist but noted they "become congruent proximal to the target, with a tipping point around 200-300ms pre-target"
- Why unresolved: The study identified the tipping point but didn't investigate what determines its location or how the effects combine
- What evidence would resolve it: Parametric manipulation of the temporal distance between context and target while measuring the transition point and relative effect strengths

## Limitations

- The assumption that pitch and speech rate are the primary acoustic dimensions driving context effects remains untested; other prosodic features (amplitude, spectral tilt, voice quality) may contribute but were not manipulated
- The stimulus manipulation range (±100 cents pitch, ±1% duration) may not fully capture natural variation in spontaneous speech, potentially limiting ecological validity
- Cross-linguistic comparison is constrained by the specific vowel contrasts chosen; results may not generalize to other phoneme pairs or language combinations
- The 1-interval forced-choice design may introduce response bias that confounds pure perceptual effects, though bias analysis was performed

## Confidence

- Reverse correlation reliably reconstructs perceptual weighting (High): Method is well-established in the literature with multiple validation studies across acoustic domains
- Conflicting proximal congruent and distal contrastive effects (Medium): The temporal resolution is sufficient to separate effects, but the interpretation of "contrastive" versus "congruent" depends on specific statistical thresholds and may be sensitive to analysis parameters
- Similar prosodic profiles in L1 and L2 speakers (Medium): While patterns appear similar, the study did not include detailed individual difference measures that might reveal underlying heterogeneity

## Next Checks

1. Conduct control experiments using synthesized stimuli with known perceptual weights to verify that the reverse correlation method recovers expected patterns
2. Replicate the kernel analysis using different temporal window sizes (e.g., 50ms vs 100ms) to confirm robustness of the proximal/distal separation
3. Test a subset of participants with an adaptive staircase procedure to independently verify the ambiguity levels of the manipulated stimuli
