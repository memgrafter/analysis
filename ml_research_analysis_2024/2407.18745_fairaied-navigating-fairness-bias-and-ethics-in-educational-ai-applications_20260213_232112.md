## Executive Summary
This survey addresses the fragmented nature of fairness research in educational AI by proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates bias sources, fairness definitions, mitigation strategies, evaluation resources, and ethical considerations. It introduces a novel taxonomy categorizing biases into individual-level, group-level, and multi-level dimensions, capturing fairness concerns that simultaneously affect both individual students and student groups. The survey highlights practical challenges such as censored or partially observed learning outcomes and the difficulty in quantifying fairness-utility trade-offs.

A key contribution is the Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU) framework, which provides a unified protocol for balancing fairness and predictive performance through a two-dimensional coordinate system. The survey also reviews analytical tools, datasets, and ethical guidelines to support equitable AI deployment in education. Overall, it establishes a structured foundation for advancing fairness, accountability, and inclusivity in AI-driven educational systems.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on algorithmic fairness in educational AI, organizing it into a harmonized framework. It introduces a taxonomy categorizing biases into individual-level, group-level, and multi-level dimensions, proposes the Fairness Bonded Utility framework for evaluating fairness-utility trade-offs, and highlights practical challenges like censored outcomes. The methodology involves systematic literature review, framework development, and integration of analytical tools and datasets for fairness evaluation in educational contexts.

## Key Results
- Introduces a novel taxonomy categorizing biases into individual-level, group-level, and multi-level dimensions
- Proposes the Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU) framework for systematic evaluation of fairness-performance trade-offs
- Highlights practical challenges including censored outcomes and the difficulty in quantifying fairness-utility trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The paper works because it integrates bias sources, fairness definitions, mitigation strategies, evaluation resources, and ethical considerations into a single, harmonized framework.
- Mechanism: By unifying fragmented research across algorithmic fairness and educational applications, it provides a coherent lens for identifying and addressing biases at individual, group, and multi-level dimensions simultaneously.
- Core assumption: Fairness problems in educational AI are interconnected and cannot be fully addressed by treating individual and group fairness in isolation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The survey integrates "multiple dimensions, including bias sources, fairness definitions, mitigation strategies, evaluation resources, and ethical considerations, into a harmonized, education-centered framework."
  - [section] Introduces a novel taxonomy categorizing biases into individual-level, group-level, and multi-level dimensions, capturing fairness concerns that simultaneously affect both individual students and student groups.
  - [corpus] The corpus shows related work evaluating fairness in LLMs for education and job matching, indicating real-world need for multi-level bias analysis.
- Break condition: If biases in educational AI are actually independent across individual and group levels, the unified framework could become unnecessarily complex without added benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU) framework enables systematic evaluation of fairness-performance trade-offs.
- Mechanism: By mapping mitigation techniques onto a two-dimensional coordinate system, FBU categorizes interventions based on their effects on both fairness and predictive utility, offering clear guidance for selecting approaches under real-world constraints.
- Core assumption: Fairness-utility trade-offs can be meaningfully quantified and visualized, allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about acceptable balances.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Introduces the "Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU) framework, which provides a unified protocol for balancing fairness and predictive performance through a two-dimensional coordinate system."
  - [section] FBU categorizes interventions into five levels from "Jointly Advantageous" to "Jointly Disadvantageous," enabling comparison of trade-offs.
  - [corpus] Limited corpus evidence on explicit fairness-utility trade-off frameworks in education, though related papers mention fairness evaluations.
- Break condition: If fairness and utility are not sufficiently quantifiable or if their relationship is too context-dependent, the FBU framework may not provide actionable guidance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Addressing censored or partially observed learning outcomes is critical for realistic fairness assessment in educational AI.
- Mechanism: The survey explicitly highlights practical challenges like censored data, proposing evaluation methods such as Concordance Imparity that can handle uncertainty in student outcomes.
- Core assumption: Educational datasets often contain incomplete records due to transfers, dropouts, or ongoing enrollments, and fairness methods must account for this reality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Explicitly examines "practical challenges such as censored or partially observed learning outcomes."
  - [section] Introduces "Censored Outcome Bias" and proposes the Concordance Imparity metric to handle censored educational data.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related works focus more on general LLM biases than censored data challenges.
- Break condition: If educational datasets rarely contain censored outcomes or if censored data can be reliably imputed, the specialized treatment may be unnecessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-level fairness
  - Why needed here: The survey introduces a novel dimension that captures how biases simultaneously affect individuals and groups, which is not addressed by traditional fairness frameworks.
  - Quick check question: How does the multi-level fairness dimension differ from treating individual and group fairness separately?

- Concept: Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU) framework
  - Why needed here: FBU provides a structured way to evaluate and balance fairness and predictive performance, addressing the lack of unified protocols in educational AI.
  - Quick check question: What are the five effectiveness levels defined by FBU, and what does each level represent?

- Concept: Concordance Imparity for censored data
  - Why needed here: Educational datasets often have incomplete outcomes, and standard fairness metrics assume full observability, making censored data handling essential.
  - Quick check question: How does Concordance Imparity adjust fairness evaluation for censored or partially observed student outcomes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Taxonomy of biases (individual, group, multi-level) -> Fairness definitions and metrics (statistical parity, equal opportunity, predictive parity, concordance impropity) -> Bias mitigation strategies (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) -> Evaluation tools and datasets -> Ethical guidelines and policy frameworks -> FBU framework for fairness-utility trade-offs

- Critical path:
  1. Identify bias sources in the educational dataset (pre-processing stage)
  2. Select appropriate fairness metrics based on bias type and context
  3. Apply mitigation strategies aligned with fairness goals
  4. Evaluate fairness-utility trade-offs using FBU framework
  5. Validate results using fairness-focused datasets and tools

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Individual vs. group fairness: Balancing treatment of similar students with equitable outcomes across demographic groups
  - Fairness vs. predictive accuracy: Determining acceptable trade-offs using FBU framework
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: More sophisticated fairness methods may reduce transparency

- Failure signatures:
  - Fairness metrics show improvement but real-world inequities persist
  - Mitigation strategies degrade model performance beyond acceptable thresholds
  - Framework complexity prevents adoption by practitioners

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the bias taxonomy to a sample educational dataset to identify which bias types are present
  2. Implement a basic pre-processing reweighing technique and measure its effect on group fairness metrics
  3. Use FBU framework to visualize fairness-utility trade-offs for different mitigation strategies on a classification task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multi-level fairness be systematically evaluated in real-world educational AI systems where biases at individual and group levels interact dynamically?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly introduces multi-level fairness as a novel dimension capturing simultaneous biases at individual and group levels, and discusses its importance in educational contexts.
- Why unresolved: Current fairness metrics and frameworks often treat individual and group fairness separately, lacking methods to assess their interplay in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of evaluation protocols that quantify multi-level fairness trade-offs in deployed educational AI systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What unified fairness-utility protocols can effectively guide practitioners in balancing predictive accuracy and fairness in censored or partially observed educational data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights censored outcome bias and the absence of unified protocols for determining fairness-utility trade-offs in educational AI.
- Why unresolved: Existing protocols assume complete data and clear utility measures, making them inapplicable to common educational scenarios with incomplete records.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating effective fairness-utility balancing in censored educational datasets using unified protocols.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can fairness interventions in educational AI be designed to simultaneously address structural inequities (e.g., digital divide) and algorithmic biases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the digital divide as a critical challenge and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address equity issues.
- Why unresolved: Current fairness research focuses primarily on algorithmic solutions, often overlooking broader structural barriers to equitable AI access and adoption.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or interventions showing measurable improvements in educational equity through combined algorithmic and structural approaches.

## Limitations

- The specific implementation details for the Fairness Bonded Utility (FBU) framework, including pseudo-model generation and trade-off normalization, are not fully specified
- While introducing novel concepts like multi-level fairness and censored data handling, corpus evidence supporting their necessity in educational contexts remains limited
- The practical applicability of proposed ethical guidelines across diverse educational settings requires further validation

## Confidence

- High: The survey provides a comprehensive framework structure for fairness in educational AI
- Medium: Specific implementation details for FBU framework and empirical validation of novel concepts
- Low: Practical effectiveness of proposed ethical guidelines across diverse educational contexts

## Next Checks

1. Implement the Concordance Imparity metric on a real educational dataset with censored outcomes and verify its sensitivity to fairness violations compared to traditional metrics
2. Conduct a systematic review of current educational AI applications to quantify the prevalence of individual, group, and multi-level biases as categorized in the proposed taxonomy
3. Design and execute a controlled experiment comparing the FBU framework's trade-off visualizations against practitioner decision-making in selecting fairness mitigation strategies
