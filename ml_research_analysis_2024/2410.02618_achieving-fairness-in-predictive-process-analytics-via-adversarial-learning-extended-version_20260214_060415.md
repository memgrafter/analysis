# Achieving Fairness in Predictive Process Analytics via Adversarial Learning (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02618
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Adversarial debiasing framework achieves 99% reduction in protected variable influence while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of integrating debiasing into predictive business process analytics, where predictions often inadvertently incorporate protected variables (e.g., gender, nationality) that can lead to discriminatory outcomes. The authors propose a novel adversarial debiasing framework that trains prediction models to forecast process outcomes while simultaneously preventing adversarial networks from accurately predicting protected variables. This approach ensures that protected variables have minimal influence on the final predictions without sacrificing predictive performance.

The framework was evaluated across four case studies spanning three different business processes, focusing on predicting total process time and activity occurrences. Results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully reduces the influence of protected variables on predictions, with Shapley values dropping to as low as 1% of their original values. Importantly, the approach achieves better prediction accuracy than existing fairness-preserving methods while maintaining higher levels of fairness, as measured by reduced standard deviations in false and true positive rates across different protected variable groups.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework leverages adversarial debiasing through a dual-objective training approach. The prediction model is trained to forecast process outcomes (such as total process time or activity occurrences) while an adversarial network simultaneously attempts to predict protected variables from the same input features. During training, the prediction model is penalized when the adversarial network successfully predicts protected variables, forcing the model to learn representations that minimize the influence of these protected attributes. This adversarial training process continues until the prediction model achieves accurate predictions while the adversarial network fails to reliably recover protected variables. The framework was implemented and tested across multiple case studies using real-world process mining datasets, with fairness evaluated through statistical measures including Shapley values and standard deviations in classification rates across protected groups.

## Key Results
- Protected variable Shapley values reduced to as low as 1% of original values
- Achieved better prediction accuracy than existing fairness-preserving approaches
- Demonstrated reduced standard deviations in false and true positive rates across protected variable groups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the adversarial training paradigm where two neural networks compete against each other. The prediction model learns to minimize prediction error while maximizing the adversarial network's prediction error for protected variables. This creates a min-max optimization problem where the prediction model must find representations that are informative for the target prediction but uninformative for protected variables. The Shapley value analysis confirms that protected variables have minimal contribution to final predictions, while statistical fairness metrics show balanced performance across different protected groups.

## Foundational Learning
- Adversarial learning in neural networks: Required to understand how competing objectives can be optimized simultaneously; quick check: verify the min-max optimization formulation
- Process mining and event logs: Essential for understanding the input data structure and prediction targets; quick check: confirm understanding of case attributes and event sequences
- Shapley value analysis for feature importance: Needed to quantify the influence of protected variables; quick check: verify Shapley value calculation methodology
- Fairness metrics in machine learning: Required to evaluate the effectiveness of debiasing; quick check: confirm understanding of false/true positive rate disparities

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input features -> Prediction model -> Target prediction + Adversarial network -> Protected variable prediction -> Combined loss function

Critical Path: Event log attributes → Prediction model training → Adversarial network training → Combined loss optimization → Final debiased predictions

Design Tradeoffs: The framework balances prediction accuracy against fairness constraints, requiring careful tuning of the adversarial loss weight to achieve both objectives without compromising either significantly.

Failure Signatures: If the adversarial network still accurately predicts protected variables, the debiasing is ineffective. If prediction accuracy drops significantly, the fairness constraints may be too restrictive.

First Experiments:
1. Test the framework on a simple synthetic dataset with known protected variable influence to verify basic functionality
2. Conduct ablation studies by removing the adversarial component to measure its specific contribution
3. Evaluate the framework on a single case study with one prediction target before scaling to multiple targets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Small sample size across the four case studies limits generalizability
- Focus on only two prediction targets (total process time and activity occurrences) restricts applicability
- Fairness metrics used may not capture all aspects of fairness in real-world deployments

## Confidence
- Prediction accuracy improvements: High
- Protected variable influence reduction: High
- General fairness metric improvements: Medium
- Cross-domain generalizability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional process mining datasets with different characteristics and prediction targets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of adversarial debiasing versus other components of the framework
3. Implement and evaluate the approach in a real-world business process monitoring system with live data to validate practical applicability and measure performance impact under operational conditions
