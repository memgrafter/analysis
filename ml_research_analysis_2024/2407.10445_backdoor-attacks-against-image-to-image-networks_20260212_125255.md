# Backdoor Attacks against Image-to-Image Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.10445
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10445
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces first backdoor attack against I2I networks using targeted UAP triggers and MTL with dynamic weighting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first backdoor attack specifically targeting Image-to-Image (I2I) networks, addressing a critical gap in backdoor attack research that has primarily focused on classification tasks. The authors propose a targeted universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) generation algorithm where the generated UAP serves as a backdoor trigger, combined with multi-task learning (MTL) using dynamic weighting methods to balance the main task and backdoor task. Experiments demonstrate the attack's effectiveness on state-of-the-art I2I architectures for image denoising and super-resolution tasks, achieving high success rates while preserving normal functionality, and showing robustness against mainstream backdoor defenses.

## Method Summary
The attack generates a targeted UAP as the backdoor trigger using an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the difference between the network's output for triggered inputs and a predefined target image. Backdoor training employs a multi-task learning framework with dynamic weighting methods (UW, DWA, PCGrad) to balance the main task and backdoor task, improving convergence rates. The attack is evaluated on benchmark datasets (Color400, CSet8 for denoising; BSD100, Set14 for super-resolution) and extended to downstream tasks including image classification (ImageNet-1k) and object detection (Pascal VOC). Performance is measured using SSIM for I2I tasks and attack success rates for downstream tasks.

## Key Results
- Successfully introduces backdoor attacks against I2I networks for the first time
- Achieves high attack success rates while maintaining normal functionality as measured by SSIM metrics
- Demonstrates effectiveness on state-of-the-art I2I architectures for denoising and super-resolution tasks
- Shows robustness against mainstream backdoor defenses
- Extends the attack to downstream tasks including image classification and object detection through UAP transferability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Targeted UAP generation algorithm creates triggers that map input images to predefined backdoor target images in I2I networks.
- **Mechanism:** Iteratively optimizes universal perturbation to minimize difference between network output for triggered inputs and predefined target image across small sample set.
- **Core assumption:** I2I networks are susceptible to adversarial perturbations that can be optimized to control output images toward specific targets.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "targeted universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) generation algorithm for I2I networks, where the generated UAP is used as the backdoor trigger" [section] "we iteratively pick one sample from S and employ the gradient descent algorithm to minimize Lt for I rounds to optimize trigger t"
- **Break condition:** Optimization fails to reduce distance between output and target images, or UAP becomes ineffective on different inputs than those used during generation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Multi-task learning with dynamic weighting improves convergence and balances main task with backdoor task in I2I networks.
- **Mechanism:** Training uses two loss functions with dynamic weights that adapt based on task uncertainty or gradient conflicts to prevent one task from dominating.
- **Core assumption:** Complexity of mapping triggered images to unrelated target images creates conflicts mitigated by adaptive weighting.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "multi-task learning (MTL) with dynamic weighting methods is employed to accelerate convergence rates" [section] "we employ a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, augmented with dynamic weighting methods, to accelerate convergence rates"
- **Break condition:** Dynamic weighting fails to properly balance tasks, leading to poor performance on either main task or backdoor task.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** I2I backdoor attack extends to downstream tasks through UAP transferability.
- **Mechanism:** UAP first generated for surrogate classification/detection model, then attached to noise-free image as backdoor target for upstream I2I model. Denoised result contains classification/detection UAP, inducing misclassifications/misdetections.
- **Core assumption:** Universal adversarial perturbations have transferable properties across different models and tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "we extend our I2I backdoor to attack downstream tasks, including image classification and object detection" [section] "the denoised result of the triggered image will contain the classification/detection UAP, and misclassifications/misdetections will occur in arbitrary clean downstream classification/detection models due to the transferability of the UAP"
- **Break condition:** UAP loses effectiveness when transferred to different downstream models or upstream I2I network significantly alters UAP during processing.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Image-to-Image (I2I) networks and their applications
  - **Why needed:** Understanding target of attack and nature of input-to-output mapping is crucial for designing effective backdoor triggers.
  - **Quick check:** What are common examples of I2I tasks, and how do they differ from image classification tasks?

- **Concept:** Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) and their generation
  - **Why needed:** Proposed attack relies on creating UAPs that effectively trigger backdoor behavior across different inputs.
  - **Quick check:** How does targeted UAP generation algorithm for I2I networks differ from traditional UAP generation for classification tasks?

- **Concept:** Multi-task learning (MTL) and dynamic weighting methods
  - **Why needed:** Backdoor training involves balancing two competing tasks, and dynamic weighting helps improve convergence and performance.
  - **Quick check:** What are key differences between static weighting and dynamic weighting methods in MTL, and why are dynamic methods preferred for this attack?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Trigger Generation Module -> Backdoor Training Module -> Evaluation Module
- **Critical path:** Trigger generation → Backdoor training → Evaluation of effectiveness and normal-functionality
- **Design tradeoffs:** Complexity of UAP generation vs. effectiveness of trigger; balance between normal-functionality and attack effectiveness; computational overhead of dynamic weighting methods vs. convergence speed
- **Failure signatures:** Low SSIM between denoised/super-resolved results and ground truth for clean inputs (poor normal-functionality); low SSIM between denoised/super-resolved results and backdoor target image for triggered inputs (low attack effectiveness); slow convergence or poor performance during backdoor training
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Generate UAP trigger and verify effectiveness on small set of samples
  2. Perform backdoor training with static weighting and evaluate balance between normal-functionality and attack effectiveness
  3. Compare performance of different dynamic weighting methods (UW, DWA, PCGrad) in terms of convergence speed and final attack performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but identifies several research directions based on its findings. The authors suggest exploring alternative UAP generation methods beyond their proposed algorithm, investigating different trigger patterns beyond UAPs, and evaluating the attack's performance on real-world applications such as medical imaging or autonomous driving systems.

## Limitations

- Attack effectiveness across diverse I2I architectures and tasks remains uncertain, with results primarily demonstrated on denoising and super-resolution
- Paper demonstrates robustness against "mainstream" backdoor defenses without specifying which defenses or quantifying resistance level
- Computational overhead of dynamic weighting methods and their impact on convergence speed versus static weighting approaches is not thoroughly characterized

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core mechanism of using targeted UAPs as backdoor triggers in I2I networks is well-supported by iterative optimization algorithm and experimental results showing controlled output manipulation
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of MTL with dynamic weighting in balancing main and backdoor tasks is supported by convergence rate improvements, but specific advantages over static weighting could benefit from more comprehensive ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence:** Extension to downstream tasks through UAP transferability is conceptually sound and demonstrated, but practical effectiveness may vary depending on specific downstream models and architectures

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Generalization Test:** Evaluate attack's effectiveness across broader range of I2I architectures (e.g., U-Net variants, Pix2Pix, CycleGAN) and tasks (e.g., segmentation, inpainting) to assess generalization beyond denoising and super-resolution.

2. **Defense Robustness Quantification:** Test attack against specific state-of-the-art backdoor defenses (e.g., spectral signatures, activation clustering, STRIP) and provide quantitative metrics on detection rates and defense effectiveness to better characterize attack's robustness.

3. **Dynamic vs. Static Weighting Comparison:** Conduct comprehensive ablation study comparing different dynamic weighting methods (UW, DWA, PCGrad) against static weighting approaches, measuring not only convergence speed but also final attack performance and computational overhead to determine practical benefits of dynamic methods.
