# FairStream: Fair Multimedia Streaming Benchmark for Reinforcement Learning Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21029
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21029
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A simple greedy heuristic outperforms PPO for fair multimedia streaming in a multi-agent RL benchmark

## Executive Summary
FairStream is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning environment designed to address fair multimedia streaming challenges. The benchmark introduces partial observability, multiple objectives, agent heterogeneity, and asynchronicity to create a realistic streaming scenario. The authors formalize fairness using quality of experience (QoE) and fairness metrics, and propose a computationally tractable time-independent variant. Through experiments comparing greedy heuristics and PPO across different traffic classes, the paper demonstrates that simple heuristic approaches outperform reinforcement learning agents, highlighting the difficulty of learning fair streaming policies, particularly in low-bandwidth scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes FairStream as a multi-agent RL environment where agents must balance streaming quality with fairness across heterogeneous traffic classes. The environment models partial observability through observation windows and incorporates time-independent state representations for computational efficiency. The authors formalize the problem using QoE and fairness metrics, creating a benchmark that captures key challenges in real-world multimedia streaming. Several baseline approaches are evaluated, including greedy heuristics and PPO, across varying traffic classes and bandwidth conditions. The framework is designed to be extensible for future research on multi-objective RL and agent communication strategies.

## Key Results
- A simple greedy heuristic outperforms PPO in achieving fair multimedia streaming
- Learning fair streaming policies is particularly difficult in low-bandwidth scenarios
- The time-independent variant provides computational tractability while maintaining benchmark realism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairStream works by creating a realistic multi-agent environment that captures the complexity of real-world multimedia streaming scenarios. The partial observability through observation windows forces agents to make decisions with incomplete information, mimicking real network conditions. The multiple objectives of maximizing QoE while maintaining fairness create a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. Agent heterogeneity and asynchronicity add additional layers of complexity that prevent trivial solutions. The time-independent variant enables tractable computation while preserving the essential dynamics of the streaming problem.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning**: Why needed - multiple agents must coordinate to achieve fair streaming; Quick check - can the environment support more than two agents simultaneously?
- **Quality of experience metrics**: Why needed - quantifies user satisfaction with streaming quality; Quick check - are QoE metrics aligned with human perception studies?
- **Fairness metrics in networking**: Why needed - ensures equitable resource distribution among users; Quick check - does the fairness metric prevent starvation of low-priority traffic?
- **Partial observability in RL**: Why needed - real networks have incomplete information; Quick check - how does observation window size affect learning performance?
- **Time-independent state representations**: Why needed - reduces computational complexity while preserving essential dynamics; Quick check - does time-independence significantly impact learning outcomes?
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Why needed - balances competing goals of quality and fairness; Quick check - are there Pareto-optimal solutions for different bandwidth regimes?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Environment simulator -> Agent policy -> Observation window -> QoE/fairness metrics -> Reward function
- **Critical path**: State observation → Policy decision → Action execution → Environment update → Reward calculation → Next state
- **Design tradeoffs**: Time-independence vs. temporal dynamics; computational efficiency vs. realism; simple heuristics vs. complex RL
- **Failure signatures**: Poor fairness metrics despite high QoE; inability to adapt to bandwidth changes; overfitting to specific traffic patterns
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test baseline greedy heuristic performance across different bandwidth regimes
  2. Evaluate PPO with different observation window sizes
  3. Compare time-dependent vs. time-independent variants

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Only simple heuristic policies and PPO are evaluated without hyperparameter optimization
- Impact of observation window size and temporal granularity is not systematically explored
- Evaluation focuses on a single reward formulation without exploring alternatives
- Scalability to many agents and traffic patterns remains untested

## Confidence
- **High** confidence that FairStream introduces a novel, reproducible benchmark addressing fairness in multi-agent streaming scenarios
- **Medium** confidence in the comparative evaluation, since only one RL baseline is tested without hyperparameter optimization
- **Low** confidence regarding conclusions about the fundamental difficulty of RL for this problem, as more advanced RL methods and reward formulations were not explored

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate additional RL algorithms (e.g., SAC, A3C) with hyperparameter sweeps to better assess the difficulty of learning fair streaming policies
2. Test alternative reward functions that balance fairness and QoE differently to determine sensitivity to reward design
3. Conduct ablation studies varying observation window sizes and temporal resolutions to quantify their impact on learning performance and fairness outcomes
