- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01087
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews PLMs for keyphrase prediction, addressing the gap between extraction and generation tasks.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews pre-trained language models (PLMs) for keyphrase prediction, addressing the gap between keyphrase extraction and generation tasks. It introduces structured taxonomies for PLM-based keyphrase extraction (KPE) and generation (KPG), covering methods like attention mechanisms, graph-based ranking, semantic importance, and phrase-document similarity. The paper also explores multimodal keyphrase extraction and generation, low-resource and domain-specific approaches, and applications across academic, business, healthcare, and legal domains.

## Method Summary
The survey examines PLMs trained on large text corpora using various learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) to provide insights into keyphrase extraction and generation tasks. It reviews methodologies for both KPE and KPG, including advanced attention mechanisms, graph-based ranking, and semantic importance methods. The paper also discusses multimodal approaches, domain-specific adaptations, and applications across various fields. Evaluation metrics and challenges such as absent keyphrase generation and diversity in keyphrase output are analyzed, with future research directions proposed.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive taxonomies for PLM-KPE and PLM-KPG tasks, covering various methods and techniques
- Effectiveness of advanced attention mechanisms (e.g., Longformer, Reformer) in improving KPE and KPG performance
- Need for improved evaluation metrics that account for semantic similarity rather than exact matches in keyphrase generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's unified analysis of both KPE and KPG tasks provides a comprehensive framework that bridges the gap between these traditionally separate research areas.
- Mechanism: By introducing structured taxonomies for both PLM-KPE and PLM-KPG, the survey creates a systematic classification of methods and techniques, enabling researchers to understand the relationships and differences between various approaches.
- Core assumption: A unified framework can effectively capture the nuances and complexities of both KPE and KPG tasks while highlighting their interconnections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This paper extensively examines the topic of pre-trained language models for keyphrase prediction (PLM-KP), which are trained on large text corpora via different learning (supervisor, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) techniques, to provide respective insights into these two types of tasks in NLP, precisely, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG)."
  - [section]: "We introduce appropriate taxonomies for PLM-KPE and KPG to highlight these two main tasks of NLP."
- Break condition: If the taxonomies fail to capture significant new methods or if the unified framework oversimplifies critical differences between KPE and KPG approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The incorporation of advanced attention mechanisms significantly enhances the performance of KPE and KPG tasks.
- Mechanism: By exploring and comparing various attention mechanisms such as Sparse Attention, Blockwise Attention, Linformer, Reformer, Ring Attention, Longformer, and Adaptive Attention Span, the survey demonstrates how these techniques can improve computational efficiency and model accuracy in handling long documents and capturing relevant information.
- Core assumption: Attention mechanisms can effectively address the challenges of processing long sequences and capturing relevant context in keyphrase extraction and generation tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Key findings include the effectiveness of advanced attention mechanisms (e.g., Longformer, Reformer) and the need for improved evaluation metrics and diversity in generated keyphrases."
  - [section]: "In this section, we will explore various advanced attention mechanisms that have the potential to enhance the performance of KPE and KPG tasks significantly."
- Break condition: If the attention mechanisms fail to improve performance on specific types of documents or if they introduce significant computational overhead that outweighs their benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey's comprehensive analysis of multimodal keyphrase extraction and generation addresses the growing need for processing diverse data types beyond text.
- Mechanism: By exploring methods that integrate textual, visual, and other modalities, the survey provides insights into how these approaches can enhance the understanding and generation of keyphrases from rich, multi-modal content.
- Core assumption: Multi-modal approaches can capture additional context and meaning that text-only methods might miss, leading to more accurate and comprehensive keyphrase extraction and generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The survey also explores multimodal keyphrase extraction and generation, low-resource and domain-specific approaches, and applications across academic, business, healthcare, and legal domains."
  - [section]: "The advent of multimodal data, which includes combinations of text, image, video, and audio, presents both challenges and opportunities for keyphrase extraction and generation."
- Break condition: If multi-modal approaches fail to consistently outperform text-only methods or if they introduce significant complexity that limits their practical applicability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding PLMs is crucial for grasping how they are applied to keyphrase prediction tasks and what advantages they offer over traditional methods.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between BERT, GPT, and T5 in terms of their architecture and how they handle keyphrase prediction tasks?

- Concept: Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) vs. Keyphrase Generation (KPG)
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between these two tasks is essential for understanding the different challenges and approaches involved in identifying versus creating keyphrases.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences in methodology and evaluation between KPE and KPG tasks?

- Concept: Attention Mechanisms in NLP
  - Why needed here: Attention mechanisms are critical for understanding how modern PLMs focus on relevant parts of input data for keyphrase extraction and generation.
  - Quick check question: How do different attention mechanisms (e.g., self-attention, cross-attention) contribute to the effectiveness of keyphrase prediction models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Input Layer -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Embedding Layer -> PLM Core -> Attention Mechanism Module -> Task-Specific Heads -> Post-processing Layer -> Evaluation Module

- Critical path:
  1. Input document → Preprocessing → Embeddings
  2. Embeddings → PLM Core → Attention Mechanism
  3. Attention output → Task-Specific Head (KPE or KPG)
  4. Head output → Post-processing → Final keyphrases
  5. Keyphrases → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. inference speed: Larger models may offer better performance but at the cost of slower processing and higher resource requirements
  - Attention mechanism complexity: More sophisticated attention methods can improve performance but may increase computational complexity
  - Multimodal integration: Including additional data types can enhance understanding but also increases model complexity and data requirements
  - Diversity vs. relevance: Balancing the need for diverse keyphrases against the requirement for highly relevant ones

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on long documents: May indicate issues with attention mechanism or model capacity
  - Overfitting to specific domains: Suggests need for better regularization or more diverse training data
  - Inability to generate absent keyphrases: Points to limitations in the model's understanding of context and inference capabilities
  - Slow inference times: Could be due to inefficient implementation of attention mechanisms or model architecture

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare different attention mechanisms (Longformer vs. Reformer) on a benchmark KPE dataset, measuring both accuracy and inference speed
  2. Evaluate the impact of multimodal input (text + images) on keyphrase generation quality compared to text-only approaches
  3. Test the effectiveness of domain-specific fine-tuning on KPG performance in specialized fields (e.g., biomedical vs. general domain)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively integrate external knowledge bases to improve absent keyphrase generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a key challenge, noting that current models struggle with predicting absent keyphrases accurately and suggesting that integrating external knowledge bases could provide additional context.
- Why unresolved: Integrating external knowledge requires sophisticated methods to combine diverse data sources without overwhelming the model or losing context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing keyphrase generation performance with and without external knowledge integration, demonstrating improved accuracy and relevance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal hyper-parameters for using ChatGPT in keyphrase generation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that hyper-parameter settings can greatly influence ChatGPT's performance, yet there is a lack of systematic studies on their impact.
- Why unresolved: The complexity of ChatGPT's architecture and the variability in task requirements make it difficult to establish universal optimal settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments varying hyper-parameters across diverse datasets to identify patterns and best practices for keyphrase generation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop evaluation metrics that account for semantic similarity rather than exact matches in keyphrase generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the limitation of current evaluation metrics, which rely on exact matches and fail to capture semantic similarity.
- Why unresolved: Creating metrics that accurately measure semantic similarity is challenging due to the nuances of language and context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new metrics that incorporate semantic embeddings and human evaluation to assess the quality of generated keyphrases more accurately.

## Limitations
- The survey acknowledges the rapidly evolving nature of attention mechanisms and multimodal integration techniques, which may affect the generalizability of findings.
- Specific quantitative comparisons between methods are limited, potentially affecting the strength of claims regarding relative performance.
- Reproducibility of specific model configurations and optimal hyper-parameters remains a challenge for implementing the reviewed approaches.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the comprehensive taxonomy of PLM-based keyphrase extraction and generation methods
- Medium confidence in the analysis of attention mechanisms and multimodal integration due to implementation variations
- High confidence in the discussion of evaluation metrics and future directions based on established research practices

## Next Checks
1. Replicate key experiments comparing Longformer and Reformer attention mechanisms on benchmark KPE datasets to verify reported performance differences
2. Conduct cross-domain evaluation of PLM-KP models to assess generalization capabilities beyond their training domains
3. Implement and test the proposed multimodal integration approaches on a standardized dataset combining text and images to validate claimed improvements in keyphrase quality
