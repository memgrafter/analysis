# Action2Sound: Ambient-Aware Generation of Action Sounds from Egocentric Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.09272
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09272
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes AV-LDM to disentangle action sounds from ambient sounds in video-to-audio generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D-Sounds and EPIC-KITCHENS datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating realistic action sounds from silent videos in the presence of off-screen ambient sounds. The proposed AV-LDM model disentangles foreground action sounds from background ambient sounds by conditioning on audio from different timestamps during training. At inference, retrieval-augmented generation selects relevant audio conditions. The method outperforms baselines on standard metrics and enables controllable ambient sound generation, showing promise for VR game applications.

## Method Summary
The AV-LDM model uses a latent diffusion approach conditioned on both video and audio features. During training, the model receives both target audio and neighboring audio clips from the same video to disentangle action and ambient sounds. At inference, it retrieves semantically relevant audio conditions from the training set using an audio-visual similarity model. The model is trained on curated Ego4D-Sounds dataset and evaluated on multiple metrics including Fréchet Audio Distance, audio-visual synchronization, and contrastive language-audio scores.

## Key Results
- AV-LDM outperforms baselines on Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), audio-visual synchronization, and CLAP scores
- Achieves better action-focused sound generation with minimal ambient sounds
- Demonstrates effectiveness on both Ego4D-Sounds and EPIC-KITCHENS datasets
- Shows potential for controllable ambient sound generation in VR applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Disentangling action sounds from ambient sounds by conditioning on audio from a different timestamp in the same video
- Mechanism: During training, the model receives both the target audio and a neighboring audio clip. The neighboring clip shares ambient sounds but not the precise action timing, forcing the model to learn action cues from video rather than ambient cues from audio
- Core assumption: Ambient sounds persist across time while action sounds are localized, so a temporally nearby audio clip will share ambient characteristics but not the target action
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "our key observation is that while action sounds are highly localized in time, ambient sounds tend to persist across time."
  - [section]: "Given this observation, we propose a simple but effective solution to disentangle ambient and action sounds: during training, in addition to the input video clip, we also condition the generation model on an audio clip from the same long video as the input video clip but from different timestamps."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for this specific disentanglement mechanism
- Break condition: If ambient sounds are not stationary across time (e.g., rapidly changing environments), the neighboring audio may not share ambient characteristics, breaking the disentanglement signal

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation selects audio conditions that are semantically relevant to the visual scene
- Mechanism: At inference time, the model retrieves an audio clip from the training set that maximizes audio-visual similarity with the input video, providing ambient context while encouraging action sound generation
- Core assumption: The training set contains audio clips that are semantically relevant to various visual scenes, enabling meaningful retrieval
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "At test time, we do not assume access to (even other clips of) the ground truth video/audio. Instead, we propose to retrieve an audio segment from the training set with an audio-visual similarity scoring model."
  - [section]: "For action-ambient joint generation, we want An to be semantically relevant to the visual scene. Inspired by recent work in retrieval augmented regeneration, we propose to retrieve audio such that: An = arg max Ai∈D AV-Sim(Ai, V)"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for retrieval-augmented generation effectiveness in this specific task
- Break condition: If the retrieval model fails to find semantically relevant audio (e.g., rare or unique scenes not represented in training), the conditioning signal may be ineffective or misleading

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model learns to minimize ambient sounds when conditioned on low-ambient audio
- Mechanism: By conditioning on audio with minimal ambient sound, the model is cued to focus on action sound generation and suppress ambient generation
- Core assumption: The model can generalize from training data with ambient sounds to generate minimal ambient sounds when explicitly requested
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we find conditioning the generation on a low-ambient sound will cue the model to focus on action sound generation and generate minimal ambient sound."
  - [section]: "For action-focused generation, we want An to have minimal ambient level. We find simply filling An with all zeros results in poor performance, likely because it is too far out of the training distribution. Instead, we find conditioning the generation on a low-ambient sound will cue the model to focus on action sound generation and generate minimal ambient sound."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for this specific controllable ambient sound generation mechanism
- Break condition: If the model has not learned the generalization capability to suppress ambient sounds, conditioning on low-ambient audio may not produce the desired effect

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent diffusion models for audio generation
  - Why needed here: The paper extends latent diffusion models to handle both audio and video conditions for video-to-audio generation
  - Quick check question: How does the cross-attention mechanism work when conditioning on both video and audio features in the latent diffusion model?

- Concept: Audio-visual representation learning via contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: The model needs to learn aligned representations between audio and video to enable effective retrieval-augmented generation
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the temperature parameter τ in the contrastive learning objective, and how does it affect the alignment of audio and video representations?

- Concept: Variational autoencoder (VAE) for audio compression
  - Why needed here: The VAE compresses mel-spectrograms into latent representations that the diffusion model can process efficiently
  - Quick check question: How does the VAE's reconstruction quality affect the final audio generation quality, and what are the trade-offs in choosing the VAE architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video encoder -> Video features (cv) -> Latent diffusion model -> Generated latents -> VAE decoder -> Mel-spectrogram -> HiFi-GAN -> Waveform

- Critical path: Video → Video encoder → Video features (cv) → Latent diffusion model → Generated latents → VAE decoder → Mel-spectrogram → HiFi-GAN → Waveform

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pretrained Stable Diffusion weights for VAE and LDM speeds up training but may limit flexibility for audio-specific adaptations
  - Sampling audio conditions from nearby timestamps is simple but may occasionally include similar action sounds, potentially confusing the model
  - Retrieval-augmented generation enables semantic conditioning but depends on the quality and coverage of the training set

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor audio-visual synchronization: Indicates issues with the video encoder, audio condition selection, or diffusion model conditioning
  - Excessive ambient sounds in action-focused generation: Suggests the model hasn't learned to suppress ambient sounds effectively
  - Unrealistic audio quality: Could indicate problems with the VAE compression, diffusion model training, or vocoder quality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the diffusion model with only video conditioning (no audio condition) to verify the disentanglement effect
  2. Evaluate the retrieval model's ability to find semantically relevant audio clips for various video scenes
  3. Compare audio generation quality with different ambient levels in the conditioning audio to validate controllable ambient sound generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the proposed audio conditioning mechanism perform if ambient sounds had stronger temporal correlations with visual content?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that ambient sounds tend to persist across time, but also acknowledges that some ambient sounds might be weakly correlated with the visual scene (e.g., wind blowing in an outdoor environment)
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of the random neighbor audio conditioning depends on the assumption that ambient sounds are temporally stationary. If ambient sounds were strongly correlated with visual content across different timestamps, this conditioning strategy might fail to properly disentangle action and ambient sounds
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing the proposed method with a baseline that conditions on the same timestamp audio, or an analysis of the correlation between visual content and ambient sounds across timestamps in the training data

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would the retrieval-augmented generation approach still be effective if the training dataset lacked sufficient audio-visual diversity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes the importance of retrieval-augmented generation for selecting semantically relevant audio conditions, but does not discuss how the diversity of the training dataset might impact this approach
- Why unresolved: The retrieval-augmented generation relies on finding audio segments that are semantically similar to the input video. If the training dataset lacks sufficient diversity, the retrieval process might fail to find relevant audio conditions, leading to poor generation quality
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment evaluating the model's performance on a subset of the data with limited audio-visual diversity, or an analysis of the distribution of audio-visual similarities in the training set

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the model's performance on action-focused generation be further improved by explicitly modeling the ambient sound during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces an action-focused generation setting where the model is conditioned on a low-ambient sound to minimize ambient sounds in the output
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that the model can generate clean action sounds in the action-focused setting, it does not explore whether explicitly modeling the ambient sound during training could further improve performance
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment comparing the proposed action-focused generation with a variant that explicitly models the ambient sound during training, using techniques such as adversarial training or multi-task learning

## Limitations
- The disentanglement mechanism relies on the assumption that ambient sounds persist across time, which may not hold in all scenarios (e.g., rapidly changing environments)
- The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation depends heavily on the coverage and quality of the training set, potentially limiting performance on rare or unique scenes
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifications for critical components like the audio-visual similarity model and specific hyperparameters

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The overall approach of using audio conditions from different timestamps to disentangle action and ambient sounds is well-justified and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The retrieval-augmented generation framework and controllable ambient sound generation show promise but depend heavily on the quality of the training set and implementation details
- **Medium confidence**: The evaluation metrics and comparative results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, but human evaluation results are not provided to validate the perceptual quality of generated sounds

## Next Checks

1. Test the disentanglement mechanism by comparing action sound generation quality when conditioning on audio from the same vs. different timestamps, to verify the effectiveness of the temporal separation
2. Evaluate the retrieval model's ability to find semantically relevant audio clips for a diverse set of video scenes, including rare or unique scenarios not well-represented in the training set
3. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different ambient levels in the conditioning audio on the generated sound quality and the model's ability to suppress ambient sounds when requested
