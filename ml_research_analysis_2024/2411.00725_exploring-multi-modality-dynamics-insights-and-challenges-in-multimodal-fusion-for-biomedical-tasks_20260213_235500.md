# Exploring Multi-Modality Dynamics: Insights and Challenges in Multimodal Fusion for Biomedical Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00725
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: MM dynamics showed feature informativeness modestly improves explainability but modality informativeness degrades performance due to poor TCP prediction; Image MM dynamics extension qualitatively highlights image regions but lacks quantitative improvement.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates MM dynamics, a multimodal fusion approach that dynamically weights modalities based on feature and modality informativeness for biomedical classification tasks. The method integrates feature-level and modality-level informativeness to improve both performance and explainability. Experiments on RNA and protein data failed to reproduce state-of-the-art results, with modality informativeness particularly degrading performance due to poor classification confidence prediction. A novel Image MM dynamics extension was developed using U-nets to compute feature informativeness at the patch level for images. While heatmaps qualitatively highlighted relevant regions, quantitative performance remained below baseline methods.

## Method Summary
MM dynamics is a late fusion technique that dynamically weights modalities based on estimated informativeness. For each modality, a one-layer encoder with L1 regularization computes feature weights, while a regression network predicts True Class Probability (TCP) to estimate classification confidence. The weighted latent representations are then concatenated and passed to a final classifier. Image MM dynamics extends this framework to images using U-nets to compute patch-level feature informativeness, producing heatmaps that highlight relevant regions before classification. The approach was evaluated on single-cell biomedical data including RNA, protein expression, and histopathological images.

## Key Results
- Feature informativeness modestly improves performance and explainability in biomedical tasks
- Modality informativeness degrades results due to high relative errors (up to 100%) in TCP prediction
- Image MM dynamics qualitatively highlights relevant image regions but does not outperform baseline methods quantitatively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Feature-level informativeness improves classification performance by filtering noisy or irrelevant features before classification.
- Mechanism: A one-layer fully connected neural network outputs a weight for each feature; multiplying features by these weights suppresses uninformative ones, allowing the classifier to focus on relevant signals.
- Core assumption: Feature importance is static per modality and can be accurately estimated by the weighting network.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "feature informativeness modestly improves performance and explainability"
  - [section]: "The outputs wm are multiplied with xm to suppress uninformative features:exm = xm ⊙ wm"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support—no directly relevant citations on feature filtering in biomedical multimodal fusion.
- Break condition: If the weighting network cannot accurately estimate feature importance, noisy features remain, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modality-level informativeness improves classification by dynamically weighting modalities based on their classification confidence.
- Mechanism: For each modality, a classifier predicts a probability distribution; multiplying the true label by the predicted probability yields a true class probability (TCP). A regression network predicts TCP without ground truth, and modalities are weighted by this predicted TCP before fusion.
- Core assumption: Higher classification confidence correlates with modality informativeness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "modality informativeness degrades results due to poor prediction of classification confidence (high relative errors, up to 100%)"
  - [section]: "Multiplying this by the ground truth label y results in the probability for the correct label, known as the T CP m"
  - [corpus]: No corpus evidence; mechanism is invalidated by high relative errors in TCP prediction.
- Break condition: If the regression network poorly predicts TCP (high relative errors), modality weighting introduces noise and degrades performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Image MM dynamics extends feature informativeness to images by computing relevance at the patch level using a U-net architecture.
- Mechanism: A U-net produces a heat-map indicating feature informativeness per image patch; this heat-map is multiplied with the image features before classification, analogous to the tabular feature weighting.
- Core assumption: Feature informativeness in images is better captured at the patch level than at the pixel level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Using U-nets, we introduce a method to calculate feature informativeness in a meaningful way, not at the pixel level but at the patch level"
  - [section]: "The heat-maps in Figure 6 and Figure 7 provide insight into the functionality of the feature informativeness encoder"
  - [corpus]: No corpus evidence; mechanism is novel and not yet validated quantitatively.
- Break condition: If the U-net fails to learn meaningful patch-level informativeness, the method does not outperform baselines.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal fusion strategies (early, late, intermediate).
  - Why needed here: The paper compares these strategies and extends late fusion with dynamic weighting; understanding tradeoffs is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between early and late fusion in terms of modality interaction?

- Concept: True Class Probability (TCP) and its use for modality weighting.
  - Why needed here: TCP quantifies classification confidence per modality, which the modality informativeness mechanism relies on for dynamic weighting.
  - Quick check question: How is TCP computed and why is it used instead of raw softmax probabilities?

- Concept: Feature informativeness estimation via L1 regularization.
  - Why needed here: L1 loss is used to produce sparse feature weights that suppress uninformative features.
  - Quick check question: What effect does L1 regularization have on the learned feature weights compared to L2?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Modality encoders with feature informativeness -> Uni-modal classifiers -> TCP computation -> Modality informativeness regressors -> Predicted TCP weighting -> Concatenated fusion -> Final classifier

- Critical path:
  1. Input modalities → feature informativeness encoder → weighted features
  2. Weighted features → uni-modal classifier → TCP computation
  3. Features → modality informativeness regressor → predicted TCP
  4. Latent representations weighted by predicted TCP → concatenated → final classifier

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a single-layer encoder for feature informativeness trades representational power for interpretability
  - Patch-level feature informativeness in images preserves spatial coherence but may miss fine-grained pixel-level signals
  - Modality informativeness relies on TCP prediction accuracy; poor prediction harms performance

- Failure signatures:
  - High relative errors in TCP prediction indicate modality informativeness will degrade results
  - Negligible difference in performance with/without feature informativeness suggests ineffective feature weighting
  - Balanced accuracy drops when modality informativeness is enabled indicate class imbalance issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train MM dynamics with only feature informativeness enabled; measure F1 macro and balanced accuracy.
  2. Train MM dynamics with only modality informativeness enabled; compare performance to baseline.
  3. Train Image MM dynamics on single-cell images; visualize feature informativeness heat-maps and compare classification metrics to image-only baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does modality informativeness (MI) have a meaningful relationship with classification confidence (T CP) in biomedical data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper found that classification confidence prediction had high relative errors (up to 100%) and performed poorly, leading to underperformance of MI components.
- Why unresolved: The ablation studies showed MI consistently degraded performance, but the paper did not definitively prove whether the relationship between T CP and informativeness exists or if it's simply unmeasurable with current methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing alternative regression architectures or confidence metrics to see if more accurate T CP prediction improves MI performance, or empirical studies demonstrating no correlation between confidence and informativeness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Image MM dynamics achieve competitive quantitative performance with improved feature informativeness encoders?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Image MM dynamics showed promising qualitative results with heatmaps focusing on relevant image regions, but did not outperform baseline MM static methods quantitatively.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation used a relatively simple CNN architecture for image encoding, and the authors acknowledged that more sophisticated architectures like ResNet or Transformers might yield better results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing Image MM dynamics with state-of-the-art image encoders and comparing performance against both the current implementation and MM static baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MM dynamics perform when handling missing modalities in real-world biomedical applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] When images were masked during testing, MM dynamics performance degraded significantly compared to MM static, suggesting poor handling of missing modalities.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested masking modalities during inference, not during training, and did not explore alternative strategies for handling missing data beyond simple substitution with gray images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training MM dynamics with explicit missing modality scenarios and testing various imputation strategies or architecture modifications designed to handle incomplete multimodal data.

## Limitations
- High relative errors (up to 100%) in TCP prediction undermine modality informativeness mechanism reliability
- Lack of hyperparameter details and incomplete specification of regression network architecture hinder reproduction
- Image MM dynamics extension shows only qualitative improvements without quantitative performance gains

## Confidence
- Feature informativeness mechanism: Medium confidence - modestly improves performance but lacks strong corpus support
- Modality informativeness mechanism: Low confidence - poor TCP prediction with high relative errors invalidates the approach
- Image MM dynamics extension: Low confidence - novel approach not yet validated quantitatively

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the effect of feature informativeness on performance.
2. Measure relative errors in TCP prediction to quantify modality informativeness reliability.
3. Compare Image MM dynamics heat-maps to ground truth annotations for qualitative validation.
