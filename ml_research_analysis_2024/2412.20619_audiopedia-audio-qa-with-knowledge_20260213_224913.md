# Audiopedia: Audio QA with Knowledge

- Three novel Audio QA tasks requiring knowledge reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Audiopedia, a novel task requiring both audio comprehension and external knowledge reasoning. The authors define three sub-tasks: single audio QA (s-AQA), multi-audio QA (m-AQA), and retrieval-augmented QA (r-AQA). They propose a framework combining Audio Entity Linking (AEL) and Knowledge-Augmented Audio Large Multimodal Model (KA2LM) to equip Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) with knowledge reasoning capabilities. Experiments on three LALMs show significant performance improvements when augmented with AEL+KA2LM, achieving up to 55.2% accuracy on s-AQA and 21.5% on r-AQA.

## Method Summary
The framework uses wav2vec 2.0 for audio transcription, then links named entities in the transcription to a knowledge base using cosine similarity. The retrieved knowledge is combined with the question and audio in a prompt that's fed to a pre-trained LALM. For multi-audio tasks, relevant clips are retrieved based on cosine similarity with the question before applying the same AEL+KA2LM pipeline. All experiments use zero-shot evaluation on synthetic datasets created from a business knowledge base.

## Key Results
- LTU-AS with AEL+KA2LM achieves 54.7% accuracy on s-AQA
- Same model achieves 55.2% on m-AQA and 21.5% on r-AQA
- Framework improves performance across all three LALMs (Audio-flamingo, GAMA, LTU-AS)
- Demonstrates effectiveness of knowledge integration for audio QA tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Audio Entity Linking (AEL)
- Transcribe audio → encode text → compute cosine similarity with KB entity embeddings → retrieve top-1 knowledge → augment LALM prompt
- Core assumption: Named entity appears in KB and cosine similarity correctly identifies it
- Evidence: Abstract states AEL improves knowledge-intensive AQA tasks; Section IV-A describes cosine similarity computation
- Break condition: Transcription errors or missing KB entity cause wrong knowledge retrieval

### Mechanism 2: Knowledge-Augmented Audio Large Multimodal Model (KA2LM)
- Combine retrieved knowledge with question and audio in single prompt → feed to LALM → generate answer
- Core assumption: LALM can integrate and reason over multimodal inputs
- Evidence: Abstract mentions KA2LM improves knowledge-intensive tasks; Section IV-B describes prompt augmentation
- Break condition: LALM cannot effectively fuse multimodal context, degrading accuracy

### Mechanism 3: Retrieval-augmented AQA (r-AQA)
- Encode all audio clips and question → compute cosine similarities → select clips above threshold → treat as multi-audio QA
- Core assumption: Relevant clips have embeddings closer to question than irrelevant ones
- Evidence: Abstract describes r-AQA as most challenging task; Section IV-E details similarity-based retrieval
- Break condition: Threshold too low/high causes retrieval noise, reducing QA accuracy

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity in embedding space
  - Why needed here: Matches transcribed audio to KB entity embeddings and retrieves relevant audio clips
  - Quick check: If two embeddings have cosine similarity 0.9, are they considered very similar? (Yes)

- Concept: Named entity linking
  - Why needed here: Links spoken entities to structured knowledge facts for QA reasoning
  - Quick check: If "KFC" is mentioned in audio, what KB entity should AEL retrieve? (KFC entity with associated facts)

- Concept: Prompt augmentation
  - Why needed here: Injects retrieved knowledge into LALM prompt to enable reasoning beyond audio content
  - Quick check: What two pieces of information are combined in the augmented prompt? (Audio + retrieved knowledge + question)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Audio → Wav2vec2.0 ASR → Text encoder → Cosine similarity → KB retrieval → Prompt builder → LALM → Answer
  Multi-audio path: Repeat retrieval for each clip → Concatenate → Single LALM pass
  Retrieval path: Question encoder → Clip encoder → Similarity threshold → Subset selection → Multi-audio QA path

- Critical path:
  1. Audio transcription accuracy (Wav2vec2.0)
  2. Entity linking accuracy (cosine similarity ranking)
  3. Knowledge relevance to question (prompt design)
  4. LALM reasoning quality on augmented prompt

- Design tradeoffs:
  - KB size vs. retrieval speed (full vs. partial knowledge in AEL)
  - Threshold strictness vs. recall in r-AQA retrieval
  - Prompt length vs. LALM context window limits
  - Entity linking precision vs. recall (top-1 vs. top-k)

- Failure signatures:
  - Low AEL accuracy → QA performance drops across all tasks
  - High r-AQA retrieval F1 but low QA accuracy → LALM cannot fuse contexts
  - Large gap between oracle and non-oracle accuracy → Knowledge retrieval is bottleneck

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate Wav2vec2.0 ASR quality on Audiopedia audio samples
  2. Test AEL accuracy using entity-name-only vs. full knowledge on s-AQA
  3. Measure r-AQA retrieval F1 at different similarity thresholds on test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does performance change when using multilingual datasets beyond English?
- Basis: Paper notes current limitation to English entities
- Why unresolved: Authors didn't test multilingual scenarios
- Evidence needed: Testing framework on multilingual datasets and comparing accuracy across languages

### Open Question 2
- Question: What's the impact of incorporating more diverse knowledge graphs beyond current business-KB?
- Basis: Current dataset uses business-KB from Wikidata; paper suggests expanding entity coverage
- Why unresolved: Study limited to specific knowledge base
- Evidence needed: Experimenting with different knowledge graphs and measuring task accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does performance vary with number of named entities per audio?
- Basis: Paper assumes single entity per audio, which may not reflect real-world scenarios
- Why unresolved: Framework not tested on audios with multiple entities
- Evidence needed: Creating datasets with multiple entities per audio and analyzing accuracy changes

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on knowledge base completeness - missing entities prevent relevant knowledge retrieval
- Synthetic datasets may not fully represent real-world audio QA challenges
- Zero-shot evaluation approach may not reveal full potential with fine-tuning

## Confidence
- High confidence in AEL mechanism and implementation details
- Medium confidence in KA2LM's effectiveness (mechanism described but fusion capability not thoroughly validated)
- Medium confidence in retrieval-augmented approach (cosine similarity straightforward but complex audio scenarios not extensively tested)

## Next Checks
1. Validate wav2vec 2.0 ASR quality on Audiopedia audio samples using word error rate (WER)
2. Conduct AEL ablation study comparing entity-name-only vs. full knowledge triplets on s-AQA
3. Systematically vary similarity threshold in r-AQA and plot retrieval F1 vs. QA accuracy to identify optimal threshold
