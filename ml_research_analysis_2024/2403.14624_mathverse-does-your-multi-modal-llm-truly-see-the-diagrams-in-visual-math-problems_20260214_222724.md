# MathVerse: Does Your Multi-modal LLM Truly See the Diagrams in Visual Math Problems?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14624
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14624
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces MATHVERSE, a specialized benchmark for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual mathematical problem-solving

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MATHVERSE, a specialized benchmark for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual mathematical problem-solving. The benchmark addresses limitations in existing datasets by transforming each problem into six versions with varying information content in text and vision, enabling assessment of whether MLLMs truly interpret mathematical diagrams. MATHVERSE includes 2,612 high-quality problems across plane geometry, solid geometry, and functions, totaling 15,672 test samples. The authors propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy using GPT-4 to extract and score key reasoning steps, providing detailed error analysis.

Experiments show that most MLLMs struggle with visual diagram interpretation, often performing better without visual input due to inaccurate visual encoding. GPT-4V achieves the best overall performance, while some models like Qwen-VL-Max and InternLM-XComposer2 show significant performance drops when diagrams are removed. The findings highlight the need for improved visual encoders in MLLMs for effective mathematical reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors developed MATHVERSE by collecting 2,612 visual math problems and transforming each into six variants with different combinations of text and visual information. They employed GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to extract and score key reasoning steps from model responses, providing a detailed evaluation framework. The benchmark covers three mathematical domains: plane geometry, solid geometry, and functions, with 15,672 total test samples. The evaluation strategy focuses on assessing whether models can truly interpret diagrams rather than just pattern matching.

## Key Results
- Most MLLMs struggle with visual diagram interpretation, often performing better without visual input
- GPT-4V achieves the best overall performance across the benchmark
- Qwen-VL-Max and InternLM-XComposer2 show significant performance drops when diagrams are removed
- The findings highlight the need for improved visual encoders in MLLMs for effective mathematical reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its controlled variation of information content, which isolates the model's ability to extract and utilize visual information. By comparing performance across different problem variants, the evaluation reveals whether models are genuinely interpreting diagrams or relying on textual patterns. The Chain-of-Thought evaluation with GPT-4 provides detailed insight into reasoning processes, identifying specific failure modes in visual understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual-mathematical reasoning: Understanding how visual elements translate to mathematical concepts is crucial for evaluating MLLMs' ability to interpret diagrams
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning: Essential for breaking down complex problem-solving into assessable steps and identifying where visual understanding breaks down
- Multi-modal integration: Critical for determining how effectively models combine visual and textual information in mathematical contexts
- Diagram interpretation: Fundamental for assessing whether models can extract geometric relationships and spatial information from visual representations

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Problem Generation -> Six-way Transformation -> MLLM Inference -> GPT-4 CoT Extraction -> Scoring -> Analysis

Critical Path: Visual input → Visual Encoder → Multi-modal Fusion → Reasoning → Output

Design Tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes controlled evaluation conditions over real-world problem complexity, sacrificing ecological validity for precise measurement of visual understanding capabilities.

Failure Signatures: Models that perform better without visual input indicate poor visual encoding quality; consistent errors across problem variants suggest fundamental limitations in mathematical reasoning; correct textual reasoning with incorrect visual interpretation indicates incomplete multi-modal integration.

First Experiments:
1. Test baseline performance on text-only versions to establish textual reasoning capabilities
2. Evaluate visual-only inputs to assess pure diagram interpretation ability
3. Compare performance across the six problem variants to identify specific visual understanding gaps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies heavily on GPT-4 for scoring, introducing potential subjectivity and bias
- The six-problem transformation strategy may create artificial scenarios that don't reflect real-world mathematical problem-solving
- The benchmark covers only three mathematical domains, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence in the dataset construction methodology and problem transformation strategy
- Medium confidence in the overall benchmark performance trends across models
- Low confidence in the absolute performance numbers due to reliance on GPT-4-based scoring

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation of a random sample of problems to validate GPT-4's Chain-of-Thought scoring reliability and establish inter-rater agreement metrics

2. Test the benchmark with models that have different visual encoder architectures to determine if performance patterns are consistent across different MLLM designs

3. Expand the evaluation to include numerical precision metrics and problems requiring multi-step calculations to assess computational accuracy beyond conceptual understanding
