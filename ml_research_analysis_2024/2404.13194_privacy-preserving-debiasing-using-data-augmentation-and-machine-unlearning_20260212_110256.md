# Privacy-Preserving Debiasing using Data Augmentation and Machine Unlearning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13194
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13194
- Reference count: 21
- This paper presents a framework combining data augmentation and machine unlearning to address both data bias and privacy attacks in machine learning models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the dual challenges of data bias and privacy vulnerabilities in machine learning by proposing an iterative framework that synchronizes data augmentation and machine unlearning. The authors identify that naive combination of these techniques is insufficient due to their mutual negative influence - data augmentation increases vulnerability to membership inference attacks, while machine unlearning can inadvertently increase bias. Their solution employs guided diffusion-based data augmentation informed by bias metrics and distributed step-wise machine unlearning, evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets with significant success in reducing bias while maintaining model performance.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an iterative synchronization approach where guided diffusion-based data augmentation (informed by KL-divergence bias metrics) and distributed step-wise machine unlearning are performed alternately. The guided diffusion model generates synthetic samples based on comprehensive bias measurement, while the distributed unlearning process removes identifying information in a parallelized manner. This approach addresses the negative mutual influence between augmentation (which increases MIA vulnerability) and unlearning (which can inadvertently increase bias) by synchronizing these processes to maintain both fairness and privacy.

## Key Results
- Significant reduction in data bias while maintaining model performance
- Membership inference attack success rates reduced below 45%
- Demonstrated effectiveness on both CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets
- Framework achieves privacy preservation while generating high-quality synthetic samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Data augmentation and machine unlearning negatively influence each other when naively combined.
- Mechanism: Data augmentation increases model vulnerability to membership inference attacks by exposing more information about original data samples. Machine unlearning can inadvertently increase bias by retaining identifying information that affects bias metrics.
- Core assumption: The augmentation process inherently exposes more information from original data, making it more vulnerable to membership inference attacks. Machine unlearning algorithms based on ϵ-δ differential privacy may leave behind identifying information that affects bias metrics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "naive combination of data augmentation and machine unlearning is insufficient due to their mutual negative influence - data augmentation increases vulnerability to membership inference attacks, while machine unlearning can inadvertently increase bias"
  - [section]: "However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of machine learning (ML) models trained on augmented datasets to membership inference attacks (MIAs) [1]. MIAs involve an adversary attempting to determine whether a particular data point was part of the training dataset used to train the model."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.499, average citations=0.0. Top related titles: Data Augmentation Improves Machine Unlearning, Dataset Condensation Driven Machine Unlearning, Customized Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LLM for Debiasing Recommendation Unlearning.
- Break condition: If the augmentation process does not expose more information from original data or if machine unlearning algorithms can completely remove all identifying information without affecting bias metrics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Guided diffusion-based data augmentation can effectively reduce data bias while maintaining data quality.
- Mechanism: The guided diffusion model generates synthetic samples based on comprehensive bias measurement, using KL-divergence as the metric to measure the distance between prior and posterior distributions of attributes. This process does not introduce new bias as it extracts and follows the feature distribution from the training data.
- Core assumption: The KL-divergence between prior and posterior distributions of attributes can accurately measure data bias, and the guided diffusion model can generate high-quality synthetic samples that follow the original data characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Specifically, we maintain the fairness of the trained model with diffusion-based data augmentation, and then utilize multi-shard unlearning to remove identifying information of original data from the ML model for protection against privacy attacks."
  - [section]: "We define the partial bias of S w.r.t τ be: ∂B(S, D)/∂τ = KL(D(τ)||P (τ)), i.e., the KL-divergence between these two distributions."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only general mentions of data augmentation and debiasing in related papers, no specific mention of guided diffusion or KL-divergence metrics.
- Break condition: If the KL-divergence metric does not accurately measure data bias or if the guided diffusion model cannot generate high-quality synthetic samples that follow the original data characteristics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Distributed step-wise machine unlearning can effectively remove identifying information while maintaining model performance.
- Mechanism: The machine unlearning process is performed in a distributed manner, allowing for parallel processing and distributed computing to significantly speed up the unlearning process. The step-wise approach respects the deletion capacity limitation while the iterative synchronization with data augmentation ensures both privacy and fairness.
- Core assumption: The distributed machine unlearning approach can significantly speed up the unlearning process, and the step-wise approach can respect the deletion capacity limitation while the iterative synchronization with data augmentation ensures both privacy and fairness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Extensive experimental evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrates that our framework can significantly reduce data bias and improve the robustness of ML models against state-of-the-art MIA attacks."
  - [section]: "We adopt the idea from [18] to perform unlearning in a distributed way, shown in Figure 4. Since both learning and unlearning are performed in a distributed manner, we can significantly speed up the unlearning process through parallel processing and distributed computing."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only general mentions of machine unlearning and distributed computing in related papers, no specific mention of the step-wise approach or deletion capacity limitation.
- Break condition: If the distributed machine unlearning approach cannot significantly speed up the unlearning process or if the step-wise approach cannot respect the deletion capacity limitation while ensuring both privacy and fairness.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Augmentation -> Machine Unlearning -> Iterative Synchronization
- Critical path: Guided diffusion-based data augmentation (KL-divergence guided) → Distributed step-wise machine unlearning → Synchronization loop
- Design tradeoffs: Privacy vs. fairness tradeoff where framework aims to achieve both simultaneously; computational efficiency vs. model performance where distributed approach aims to speed up unlearning without compromising accuracy
- Failure signatures: Increased vulnerability to membership inference attacks, increased data bias, decreased model performance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the guided diffusion model in reducing data bias on a simple dataset like CIFAR-10.
  2. Test the distributed step-wise machine unlearning approach on a small dataset to assess its impact on model performance and privacy.
  3. Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the entire framework on a diverse dataset, comparing its performance against baseline methods in terms of bias reduction, privacy preservation, and model accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the iterative synchronization framework scale to larger datasets and more complex models beyond CIFAR-10 and CelebA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Experimental evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrates..." but only evaluates on CIFAR-10 and CelebA
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test the framework on larger, more complex datasets or deeper neural networks that are more representative of real-world applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing consistent performance on larger datasets (ImageNet scale), more complex architectures (ResNet-50, Vision Transformers), and different domains (medical imaging, natural language processing)

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the exact relationship between KL-divergence thresholds and the quality/utility of generated synthetic data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses KL-divergence as a metric for bias measurement but does not systematically explore how different threshold values affect the balance between bias reduction and data quality
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions "we set a forget rate of 10%" and uses KL-divergence but doesn't provide sensitivity analysis on these hyperparameters
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive ablation studies showing how varying KL-divergence thresholds affects both bias reduction metrics and downstream model performance across multiple datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework perform against adaptive membership inference attacks that specifically target the combination of data augmentation and unlearning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "none of the above solutions can completely eliminate the risk of membership inference attacks" and only evaluates against static attacks
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates against static attack methods (M-Loss, M-Mean, Moments) but doesn't consider adaptive attacks that might exploit the specific patterns created by the iterative augmentation-unlearning cycle
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with white-box adaptive attacks that specifically target the temporal patterns and data distribution changes created by the iterative framework

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide implementation details for the KL-divergence-based bias measurement
- No information on computational overhead or scalability of the distributed approach
- Limited ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component

## Confidence
- Framework effectiveness: Medium
- Privacy preservation claims: Medium
- Bias reduction claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the KL-divergence bias metric independently to verify it accurately captures bias in synthetic samples.
2. Conduct controlled experiments varying the frequency and ratio of augmentation vs. unlearning steps to optimize the iterative synchronization.
3. Perform rigorous statistical analysis on MIA success rates across multiple runs to establish confidence intervals and significance.
