# TAMS: Translation-Assisted Morphological Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14840
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14840
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: TAMS improves morphological segmentation accuracy by 1.99% in super-low resource settings (100 training samples)

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes TAMS, a method for improving morphological segmentation by incorporating translation data. TAMS uses a character-level sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM and integrates representations from high-resource language models trained on translations. The approach shows significant improvements in super-low resource settings (e.g., 1.99% accuracy increase with 100 training samples), but mixed results with more data. Interestingly, the model achieves strong performance even without requiring word-level alignments, which is promising for resource-constrained language documentation scenarios.

## Method Summary
TAMS is a character-level sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates translation data through pretrained language model embeddings. The model uses LSTM with pointer-generator architecture and integrates BERT embeddings of English translations as additional signal. It experiments with different strategies for incorporating translation vectors, including Init-State (in encoder) and Concat-Half (in decoder). The approach works with both automatic alignments (using awesome-align) and sentence-level CLS embeddings, eliminating the need for word-level alignments. Models are trained on varying training set sizes (100, 250, 500, full) using Adam optimizer with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler.

## Key Results
- TAMS outperforms baseline by 1.99 percentage points average in 100-sample setting, up to 2.87 points with poor quality alignments
- Model achieves strong performance without requiring word-level alignments, only sentence-level CLS embeddings
- Mixed results on larger training sets (500, full) suggest translation assistance becomes less beneficial with more native data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TAMS leverages high-quality pretrained language model embeddings from translation data to improve canonical morphological segmentation, especially in low-resource settings.
- Mechanism: The model uses BERT embeddings of English translations as additional signal, which captures morphological cues not available in the low-resource target language.
- Core assumption: English BERT embeddings contain morphological information useful for segmenting morphologically complex target language words.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a character-level sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates representations of translations obtained from pretrained high-resource monolingual language models as an additional signal."
  - [section] "Previous work has suggested that distributional similarity is an informative cue for morphology... Other work has suggested that BERT embeddings could encode grammatical and morphological information."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers... Average neighbor FMR=0.468, average citations=0.0." (Weak evidence of related work on translation-assisted morphological tasks)
- Break condition: If BERT embeddings don't capture relevant morphological patterns for the target language family, or if the translation is poor quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TAMS can achieve strong performance without requiring word-level alignments, making it more practical for resource-constrained language documentation.
- Mechanism: The model uses sentence-level CLS token embeddings from BERT as a fixed-length representation of the translation, bypassing the need for word alignments.
- Core assumption: Sentence-level embeddings capture sufficient information for morphological segmentation without explicit word alignments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, we find that we can achieve strong performance even without needing difficult-to-obtain word level alignments."
  - [section] "For the CLS-None strategy, we discard d0 and average pool dalign before using a model parameter Wtrans... The intuition behind including the CLS token in our representation is that it may allow us to capture sentence-level dynamics better than word-level alignments alone."
  - [corpus] (No direct evidence in corpus, weak support)
- Break condition: If sentence-level embeddings lose critical alignment information needed for accurate segmentation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TAMS is particularly effective in super-low resource settings where training data is extremely limited.
- Mechanism: The model's ability to incorporate external translation information becomes more valuable as the amount of available training data decreases.
- Core assumption: External translation information provides more relative benefit when native training data is scarce.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our model outperforms the baseline in a super-low resource setting but yields mixed results on training splits with more data."
  - [section] "In the extremely low data setting (n=100), our approach outperforms the baseline by an average of 1.99 percentage points and as high as 2.87 points, even with poor quality automatic alignments."
  - [corpus] (No direct evidence in corpus, weak support)
- Break condition: If translation quality is poor or if the translation language is too distantly related to the target language.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Canonical morphological segmentation vs surface segmentation
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically addresses canonical segmentation (underlying morpheme forms) which is different from surface segmentation and requires understanding of linguistic concepts like morpheme alternation and allomorphy.
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between segmenting "cylindrically" as "cylinder-ly" vs "cylindric-ly"?

- Concept: Pointer-generator networks in sequence-to-sequence models
  - Why needed here: TAMS uses a pointer-generator LSTM which allows copying characters directly from input to output, crucial for morphological segmentation tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does a pointer-generator network differ from a standard LSTM encoder-decoder?

- Concept: Multilingual word alignment techniques
  - Why needed here: The paper experiments with both automatic (awesome-align) and manual alignment methods to connect target language words with translation words.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between using automatic alignment tools vs manual expert alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input character sequences -> BERT embeddings of translations -> LSTM encoder (with Init-State) -> Pointer-generator LSTM decoder (with Concat-Half) -> Output canonical segmented forms

- Critical path:
  1. Tokenize and normalize input text
  2. Align target words with translation words
  3. Generate BERT embeddings for aligned translation words
  4. Create fixed-length translation vector (CLS-Concat strategy)
  5. Incorporate into encoder (Init-State) and decoder (Concat-Half)
  6. Train pointer-generator LSTM to segment words

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Alignment quality vs practicality: Manual alignment gives better results but is expensive; automatic alignment is practical but lower quality
  - Translation incorporation strategy: Different ways to incorporate translation vectors affect performance
  - Model complexity: More layers and parameters vs training efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor alignment F1 scores (e.g., 0.1735 on Tsez manual alignment) indicating translation signal may be noisy
  - Performance gains only in low-resource settings, suggesting translation assistance is less useful with more data
  - Standard deviation in accuracy metrics ranging 1.11-2.33 across settings

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test TAMS with gold-aligned data vs automatic alignment on Tsez to measure alignment quality impact
  2. Compare CLS-Only (sentence-level) vs word-level alignment strategies across different training sizes
  3. Evaluate performance on Arapaho (polysynthetic language) to test cross-family generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the performance benefit of TAMS require word-level alignments, or can sentence-level embeddings alone provide similar improvements?
- Why does TAMS show significant improvements in the 100-sample setting but mixed results in higher-resource settings?
- Would providing additional explicit morphological information (like POS tags) alongside translations further improve segmentation performance?

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope to three languages from two families constrains generalizability claims
- Automatic alignment quality is poor (F1=0.1735 on Tsez manual alignment) suggesting noisy translation signal
- Mixed results on larger training sets indicate translation assistance may become less beneficial as native data increases

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: TAMS outperforms baseline models in super-low resource settings (n=100) with 1.99 percentage point average improvement
- **Medium confidence**: Achieving strong performance without word-level alignments is supported but may be limited by poor automatic alignment quality
- **Low confidence**: Broader claims about cross-linguistic generalization and long-term viability across different resource levels are not well-supported

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic generalization test**: Evaluate TAMS on 5-10 additional languages from diverse families (e.g., Austronesian, Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan) to assess whether the translation assistance benefit extends beyond Nakh-Daghestanian and Caddoan languages.

2. **Translation quality sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary translation quality (using different automatic translation systems, or adding controlled noise) to determine the minimum viable translation quality needed for TAMS to outperform baseline methods.

3. **Scaling behavior validation**: Conduct experiments with intermediate training set sizes (e.g., 200, 400, 750 samples) to precisely characterize when translation assistance becomes less beneficial and whether there's a crossover point where baseline methods surpass TAMS.
