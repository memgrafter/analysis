# Make Compound Sentences Simple to Analyze: Learning to Split Sentences for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02297
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02297
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: ATOSS significantly improves ABSA model performance on compound sentences across multiple datasets and tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting aspect-level sentiment quadruplets from compound sentences in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). The authors propose Aspect Term Oriented Sentence Splitter (ATOSS), a plug-and-play module that simplifies compound sentences into simpler forms to aid ABSA models. ATOSS is trained via knowledge distillation from large language models and refined using preference alignment tailored to specific ABSA models. Experiments show consistent improvements in quad prediction accuracy and aspect-level F1 scores across multiple datasets and model architectures.

## Method Summary
The authors propose ATOSS (Aspect Term Oriented Sentence Splitter) as a plug-and-play module that simplifies compound sentences for ABSA tasks. ATOSS is trained in two stages: first through knowledge distillation from LLMs using zero-shot prompting to generate diverse split sentences, then refined via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with specific ABSA model preferences. The splitter can be used as either a general version or a task-specific version fine-tuned for particular ABSA models. ATOSS integrates seamlessly with existing ABSA models without requiring parameter updates, processing input sentences into simpler forms that improve quadruplet extraction accuracy.

## Key Results
- ATOSS significantly improves quad prediction accuracy (F1 score) across multiple ABSA models and datasets
- Performance gains are consistent across simple, compound, and total sentences
- ATOSS enhances aspect-level F1 scores and demonstrates strong generalizability across other ABSA tasks
- Both fine-tuned models and prompt-based LLMs benefit from ATOSS integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Simplifying compound sentences into simpler forms helps ABSA models more accurately identify aspect terms and their associated sentiment quadruplets. The splitter isolates each aspect term by breaking complex sentences into simpler, aspect-oriented clauses, reducing ambiguity in context and distance between terms. Core assumption: Sentence complexity directly impairs ABSA model performance in detecting multiple quadruplets. Evidence: High error rates observed in compound sentences across all tasks, though corpus-based validation is weak.

### Mechanism 2
Knowledge distillation from LLMs enables ATOSS to generate diverse, contextually appropriate split sentences. Zero-shot LLM prompting generates multiple candidate splits, which are filtered and fine-tuned to align with target ABSA model preferences. Core assumption: LLMs can generalize sentence-splitting patterns beyond their training data. Evidence: DPO applied to train preference-tuned sentence splitter, though explicit evaluation of diversity or quality of generated splits is weak.

### Mechanism 3
ATOSS as a plug-and-play module improves ABSA model performance without requiring parameter updates. The splitter preprocesses input sentences into simpler forms, allowing existing ABSA models to process them more effectively. Core assumption: ABSA models' performance bottleneck is sentence complexity rather than model architecture. Evidence: ATOSS integration keeps model parameters unchanged while showing performance improvements across multiple models, though if weakness lies in architecture rather than input complexity, ATOSS may not improve performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Analyzing sentiment at the aspect level rather than document level. Why needed: ATOSS targets ABSA tasks requiring extraction of aspect-level sentiment quadruplets. Quick check: What are the four components of a sentiment quadruplet in ASQP and ACOS tasks?

- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from large models to smaller ones. Why needed: ATOSS uses knowledge distillation from LLMs to learn sentence-splitting patterns. Quick check: How does supervised fine-tuning differ from direct preference optimization in training ATOSS?

- **Plug-and-Play Module Design**: Modules that can be integrated without modifying existing systems. Why needed: ATOSS is designed to integrate with existing ABSA models without parameter updates. Quick check: What are the advantages and potential limitations of using ATOSS as a preprocessing step rather than modifying the ABSA model itself?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input sentence -> ATOSS (General) -> Filtering and selection -> ATOSS (Specific) -> Output splits -> ABSA model -> Quadruplet prediction

- **Critical path**: 1. Input sentence → ATOSS (General) for initial splitting 2. Generated splits → Filtering and selection 3. Selected splits → ATOSS (Specific) for preference alignment 4. Output splits → ABSA model for quadruplet prediction

- **Design tradeoffs**: General vs. Specific ATOSS (broad coverage vs. model alignment); Zero-shot vs. Few-shot prompting (diversity vs. quality)

- **Failure signatures**: Decreased ABSA performance (indicates splitting errors); High variance in split quality (suggests filtering issues); Increased computational cost (may indicate inefficiency)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Evaluate ATOSS (General) on validation set to assess baseline splitting quality 2. Compare ABSA performance with and without ATOSS on simple vs. compound sentences 3. Test ATOSS (Specific) on multiple ABSA models to validate plug-and-play effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does ATOSS perform on other ABSA tasks beyond ASQP and ACOS, such as aspect term extraction or aspect category detection? The authors mention ATOSS can be applied to other ABSA tasks but only provide limited results for TASD and ASTE tasks.

- What is the impact of different splitting criteria on ATOSS performance? The authors mention aspect-oriented splitting strategy but do not explore the impact of different splitting criteria.

- How does ATOSS compare to other sentence simplification techniques for ABSA tasks? The authors compare ATOSS to zero-shot CoT prompting but do not explore other sentence simplification techniques.

## Limitations

- Evaluation focuses primarily on quad prediction accuracy improvements without comprehensive error analysis
- Filtering criteria for selecting split sentences from LLM outputs are mentioned but not fully specified
- Claims about generalizability across all ABSA tasks are based on limited experimental scope focused on ASQP and ACOS tasks

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core mechanism of using sentence splitting to simplify compound sentences for ABSA; plug-and-play design approach validated through consistent performance improvements

**Medium confidence**: Knowledge distillation approach shows promise but lacks detailed evaluation of generated split quality; preference alignment refinement is theoretically sound but needs more empirical validation

**Low confidence**: Claims about ATOSS's generalizability across all ABSA tasks based on limited experimental scope

## Next Checks

1. Conduct detailed error analysis comparing ABSA model outputs on compound sentences before and after ATOSS splitting

2. Implement and test the exact filtering criteria for selecting K split sentences from LLM outputs

3. Evaluate ATOSS on additional ABSA subtasks (e.g., aspect category detection, aspect sentiment classification) beyond ASQP and ACOS
