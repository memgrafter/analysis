# Enhancing the Fairness and Performance of Edge Cameras with Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.09852
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09852
- Reference count: 19
- One-line primary result: A debugging framework using XAI identifies data labeling issues as the primary source of bias in human detection models for edge cameras.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a structured debugging framework that leverages Explainable AI (XAI) to identify and address biases in human detection models for edge camera systems. The framework systematically analyzes model predictions, generates XAI explanations, and enables expert-driven problem identification and solution creation. When applied to the Bytetrack model, the framework revealed that data labeling issues, particularly bounding boxes extending beyond image boundaries, were the primary source of bias. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in detecting under-detected categories, including individuals with obscured or disabled bodies.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a seven-stage approach: data selection, prediction extraction, statistical analysis, XAI explanation generation, expert problem identification, solution proposal, and solution assessment. It uses D-RISE as the XAI method to generate saliency maps showing model attention patterns. The study applied this framework to the Bytetrack model using the CrowdHuman dataset, identifying that bounding boxes extending outside image boundaries caused detection failures. The solution involved relabeling these bounding boxes within image dimensions, followed by model retraining and evaluation.

## Key Results
- Framework identified data labeling issues as the primary source of bias, not model architecture limitations
- Relabeling bounding boxes within image boundaries improved detection of under-detected categories by 21 additional correct localizations
- Model performance enhanced in real-world surveillance scenarios, particularly for detecting disabled individuals and those with obscured bodies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured debugging framework identifies model bias sources
- Mechanism: The framework uses a systematic seven-stage approach that integrates XAI explanations with expert-driven problem identification, enabling targeted interventions on bias sources
- Core assumption: Expert interpretation of XAI explanations can accurately identify root causes of model failures
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our research presents a diagnostic method using XAI for model debugging, with expert-driven problem identification and solution creation"
  - [section] "The framework starts by selecting a training dataset subset for model enhancement, addressing potential dataset concerns"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss XAI but don't detail structured debugging frameworks
- Break condition: If experts cannot consistently identify patterns in XAI explanations, the framework's effectiveness diminishes

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: XAI methods can reveal model attention patterns that explain detection failures
- Mechanism: D-RISE generates saliency maps that show which image regions the model focuses on, revealing why certain individuals (e.g., those with obscured bodies) are not detected
- Core assumption: The model's attention patterns directly correlate with its detection decisions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By applying the framework to the Bytetrack model, the authors discovered that data labeling issues were the primary source of bias"
  - [section] "The XAI explanations in Fig. 3 indicate Bytetrack's focus on entire human bodies, exposing its struggle to detect individuals showing only their heads"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related papers discuss XAI techniques but not specifically for human detection in edge cameras
- Break condition: If XAI explanations don't align with actual model decision processes, they become misleading rather than diagnostic

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Relabeling bounding boxes within image boundaries improves detection accuracy
- Mechanism: The framework identifies that ground truth boxes extending outside image boundaries cause model confusion, and relabeling these boxes improves performance
- Core assumption: Model training is sensitive to bounding box coordinates extending outside valid image regions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Solutions such as relabeling bounding boxes to remain within image boundaries were proposed and tested"
  - [section] "The CrowdHuman dataset is reannotated by constraining bounding box coordinates within the image dimensions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers don't specifically address bounding box relabeling as a solution
- Break condition: If relabeling doesn't address the core detection problem, other interventions become necessary

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) metric
  - Why needed here: IoU is used to evaluate detection quality by comparing predicted bounding boxes with ground truth boxes
  - Quick check question: What IoU threshold is commonly used to determine if a detection is considered correct?

- Concept: Data poisoning and its effects on model performance
  - Why needed here: The framework acknowledges that public datasets may suffer from data poisoning, affecting data quality and model results
  - Quick check question: How might malicious modifications to training data affect a human detection model's performance?

- Concept: Object detection model components (detector + post-processor)
  - Why needed here: Bytetrack combines YOLOX for detection and Byte for post-processing, requiring understanding of both components for effective debugging
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the post-processing stage in multi-object tracking systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data selection module → Prediction extraction → Statistical analysis → XAI explanation generation → Expert problem identification → Solution proposal → Solution assessment → Model enhancement
- Critical path: Data selection → Prediction extraction → Statistical analysis → Explanation generation → Problem identification → Solution implementation → Model evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Sample size vs. computational efficiency: Using subset (≤10% of dataset) balances thoroughness with feasibility; Expert time vs. automated analysis: Framework relies on expert interpretation, which is resource-intensive but potentially more accurate than fully automated approaches
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent XAI explanations across similar images; Expert inability to identify common patterns in explanation data; Solutions that don't improve model performance on test cases
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the framework on a small dataset subset to validate the seven-stage process flow
  2. Apply D-RISE to compare explanations between Bytetrack and YOLOX to identify attention differences
  3. Implement bounding box relabeling on a subset and measure performance changes before/after fine-tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is the framework in identifying and addressing biases in other object detection models beyond Bytetrack?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the approach can adapt to other detection problems, especially those focusing on specific classes
- Why unresolved: The framework was only validated on the Bytetrack model, and its effectiveness on other models remains untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework on various object detection models and comparing the results with the Bytetrack model

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential limitations of using D-RISE as the XAI method for explaining object detection models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper chose D-RISE for its adaptability to diverse models and its ability to offer explanations for ground truth boxes, but it does not discuss its limitations
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of D-RISE or compare it with other XAI methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study of D-RISE with other XAI methods in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to various object detection models

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework handle real-time applications, such as live surveillance, where immediate model adjustments might be necessary?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the application of the framework to real-world scenarios like office security footage but does not address real-time adjustments
- Why unresolved: The framework's adaptability to real-time scenarios is not discussed, and it is unclear how quickly it can identify and address biases in live settings
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework in real-time surveillance settings and measuring its response time and accuracy in identifying and addressing biases

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on expert interpretation of XAI explanations rather than automated validation
- The relabeling solution's generalizability is uncertain as it was tested only on the CrowdHuman dataset
- The framework's scalability to larger datasets or more complex edge camera systems remains unproven

## Confidence

- High confidence: The structured seven-stage framework approach is well-defined and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Claims about XAI revealing model attention patterns and identifying bias sources through expert analysis
- Medium confidence: The bounding box relabeling solution's effectiveness is demonstrated but may be dataset-specific

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each framework stage, particularly measuring the value added by expert-driven problem identification versus automated analysis
2. Test the framework on additional human detection datasets (e.g., WiderPerson, MOT20) to assess solution generalizability across different surveillance contexts
3. Implement a blinded expert evaluation where multiple analysts independently interpret XAI explanations to measure inter-rater reliability and identify potential biases in human interpretation
