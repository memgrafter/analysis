- This paper presents a generative latent diffusion model for creating floorplans across diverse building types using building footprints and textual design briefs as inputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel latent diffusion model for generating architectural floorplans conditioned on both building footprints and textual design briefs. The model extends beyond residential applications to handle various building types including commercial, institutional, and cultural spaces. By leveraging a two-stage training approach and incorporating spatial constraints through footprint conditioning, the model can generate novel floorplan configurations that fuse design elements in unexpected ways while maintaining architectural coherence.

## Method Summary
The model uses a two-stage training approach where a pre-trained latent diffusion model is fine-tuned to incorporate dual conditioning signals - building footprints and textual design briefs. The first stage learns temporal denoising conditioned on text prompts, while the second stage adds footprint conditioning via a frozen clone network and zero-convolution operation. The model is trained on a dataset of 500 image-text pairs at 64x64 resolution, then evaluated at 512x512 inference resolution using FID, KID, SSIM, and PSNR metrics, along with human evaluation through a gamified interface with architects.

## Key Results
- The model achieves superior performance with FID of 22.436, KID of 1.844, SSIM of 0.130, and PSNR of 7.596
- Scale-agnostic capability allows adaptation to different building sizes without explicit scale input
- Extends floorplan generation beyond residential to commercial, institutional, and cultural building types
- Outperforms existing AI models that predominantly focus on residential functionalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Latent diffusion models can learn to generate floorplans conditioned on both textual prompts and building footprints. The model uses a two-stage training approach where first it learns temporal denoising conditioned on text prompts, then adds a second condition (building footprint) via a frozen clone network and zero-convolution operation to refine the output. The core assumption is that architectural floorplans can be represented in a latent space where both spatial footprint and design intent are jointly encoded and decoded.

### Mechanism 2
The scale-agnostic property allows the model to adapt floorplan scale based on input footprints without explicit scale input. The model learns intrinsic ratios and proportions from training data, enabling it to infer appropriate scales based on the geometry and function described in the prompt. The core assumption is that architectural design principles and component ratios are consistent across scales and can be learned from data.

### Mechanism 3
Human evaluation via gamified interface provides more meaningful assessment of architectural design quality than traditional image metrics. Architects rate images on a 1-10 scale focusing on composition and architectural integrity without knowing which are AI-generated, enabling unbiased qualitative judgment. The core assumption is that architectural design quality involves subjective aesthetic and functional criteria that cannot be fully captured by pixel-level metrics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Latent diffusion models**: Why needed - They enable high-quality image generation conditioned on multiple inputs while handling the denoising process effectively. Quick check - What is the role of the temporal denoising function in a latent diffusion model?
- **Multi-modal conditioning**: Why needed - Floorplan generation requires understanding both spatial constraints (footprint) and design intent (text prompt). Quick check - How does the model combine two different conditioning signals in the latent space?
- **Scale-invariant design principles**: Why needed - To enable generation of floorplans at different scales without explicit scale parameters. Quick check - What architectural features remain consistent across different building scales?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Encoder -> U-Net with attention -> ControlNet -> Decoder
- **Critical path**: Input image → Encoder → Latent space → U-Net denoising → ControlNet conditioning → Decoder → Output floorplan
- **Design tradeoffs**: Resolution vs. computational cost (64x64 training, 512x512 inference), number of conditioning layers (balance complexity vs. overfitting), training data size (500 pairs vs. need for more architectural variety)
- **Failure signatures**: Blurry or incomplete floorplans (insufficient denoising steps), wrong building type (poor conditioning signal integration), inconsistent scales (failure of scale-agnostic learning)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test footprint-only conditioning: Remove text prompt and verify spatial constraints are respected, 2) Test text-only conditioning: Remove footprint and verify design intent is captured, 3) Test scale variation: Input same footprint at different sizes and verify output scales appropriately

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the scale-agnostic capability perform when applied to extremely small or extremely large building footprints compared to medium-sized ones? The paper demonstrates the capability but lacks quantitative analysis of performance across different scale ranges.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of different building footprint shapes on the quality and functionality of generated floorplans? The paper shows various footprint examples but doesn't analyze how different geometric shapes affect the generated designs.

### Open Question 3
How does the model handle complex building regulations and constraints beyond basic zoning requirements? The paper mentions building regulations but doesn't explore how the model incorporates or handles complex regulatory requirements.

## Limitations

- The evaluation methodology lacks control groups for human evaluation, making it difficult to definitively claim superior architectural quality
- The dataset size of 500 pairs may be insufficient for training a complex latent diffusion model, potentially limiting generalization
- The scale-agnostic claim lacks systematic validation across diverse architectural scales and building types

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical implementation of the two-stage latent diffusion architecture with dual conditioning signals is sound and follows established diffusion model principles
- **Medium confidence**: The scale-agnostic capability is plausible but lacks comprehensive validation across diverse architectural scales and building types
- **Low confidence**: The claim of "superior performance" compared to existing AI models is not fully substantiated without baseline comparisons in human evaluation or on the same quantitative metrics

## Next Checks

1. **Controlled human evaluation experiment**: Conduct a blinded study where architects rate floorplans from this model alongside those from baseline models using the same Floorplan Game methodology, measuring inter-rater reliability and statistical significance of quality differences.

2. **Scale generalization test**: Systematically evaluate the model's performance across at least five distinct scale ranges (e.g., small pavilions, medium houses, large commercial buildings, multi-story complexes, and campus-scale plans) using identical footprints at different scales, measuring both quantitative metrics and architectural coherence.

3. **Baseline comparison on quantitative metrics**: Train or obtain comparable models using the same evaluation protocol and dataset, then compute FID, KID, SSIM, and PSNR across identical test sets to verify the claimed improvements are statistically significant and not artifacts of evaluation methodology.
