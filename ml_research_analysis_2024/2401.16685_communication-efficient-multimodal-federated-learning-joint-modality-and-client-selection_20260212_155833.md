# Communication-Efficient Multimodal Federated Learning: Joint Modality and Client Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.16685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16685
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods while reducing communication overhead by over 20x

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the communication inefficiencies in multimodal federated learning by proposing mmFedMC, a framework that jointly optimizes modality and client selection. The approach divides traditional multimodal fusion into separate modality and ensemble models, enabling modular functionality and reduced communication overhead. By using Shapley values to quantify modality impact, considering model sizes for communication costs, and incorporating recency to prevent single-modality bias, the method achieves significant efficiency gains while maintaining competitive accuracy across five real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
The mmFedMC framework employs decision-level fusion where modality models are uploaded to the server for global aggregation while ensemble models remain local for personalization. Clients evaluate modality impact using Shapley values, model sizes for communication overhead, and recency to prevent bias. Client selection is based on local loss to optimize participation and convergence. The method uses LSTM/CNN for modality models and Random Forest for ensemble models, with parameters γ, αs, αc, and αr controlling the trade-off between performance and efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods while reducing communication overhead by over 20x
- Reduces number of modality models uploaded by up to 80% across five datasets
- Maintains competitive performance in both IID and natural distribution settings
- Demonstrates effectiveness of joint modality and client selection strategy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Joint modality and client selection reduces communication overhead while preserving accuracy
- Mechanism: Clients evaluate modality impact using Shapley values, consider model size for overhead, and use recency to prevent single-modality bias. The server selects clients with lower local loss to optimize participation.
- Core assumption: Clients have heterogeneous modality availability and computational constraints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose employing a Shapley component to quantify the impact of modality models, along with assessing their sizes to estimate communication overhead"
  - [section 3.4]: "Due to the resource constraints on edge devices serving as clients, they may not possess adequate storage capacity... Thus, we introduce two metrics to assist clients to determine whether to upload their models to the server"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on compression and participation strategies but not specifically on joint modality+client selection with Shapley values
- Break condition: If client heterogeneity is low (all clients have same modalities) or communication overhead is negligible

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decision-level fusion with separate modality and ensemble models enables modular functionality
- Mechanism: Modality models are uploaded to server for global generalization while ensemble models remain local for personalization. This allows clients with missing modalities to still participate effectively.
- Core assumption: Modality models can be learned independently without significant information loss
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a decision-level fusion approach, where predictions from global modality models are used as input to the individual local ensemble model in each client"
  - [section 3.1]: "Our goal is to fuse the outputs of all modality models at the decision layer through a post-processing ensemble model ωk"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers mention fusion strategies but not this specific separation approach
- Break condition: If modality interactions are highly complex and cannot be captured by independent learning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Client selection based on lower local loss improves convergence in heterogeneous settings
- Mechanism: Clients with lower local loss are selected for uploading, ensuring the global model tends toward at least one group in bimodal loss scenarios, preventing oscillation.
- Core assumption: Local loss is a reliable indicator of client contribution to model improvement
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we implement selective client uploading, which leverages the local loss of modality model to quantify client heterogeneity"
  - [section 3.5]: "Due to the profound heterogeneity among clients, those with lower local losses can achieve faster error convergence"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss client selection but not specifically for lower loss in multimodal settings
- Break condition: If local loss is dominated by overfitting or data imbalance rather than true model quality

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shapley value computation and interpretation
  - Why needed here: To quantify modality impact on final predictions for selection
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how Shapley value measures marginal contribution of each modality to ensemble prediction?

- Concept: Federated learning aggregation mechanics
  - Why needed here: To understand how global modality models are updated from client contributions
  - Quick check question: What aggregation weight formula is used for modality models based on client sample sizes?

- Concept: Modality selection trade-offs (impact vs. communication vs. recency)
  - Why needed here: To balance model performance with resource constraints
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the recency weight affect modality selection behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Client side: Modality models (LSTM/CNN) -> Ensemble model (Random Forest) -> Shapley value calculator -> Selection logic
  - Server side: Aggregation logic -> Client selection based on local loss
  - Communication: Modality models and metadata only (no ensemble models)

- Critical path: Local training → Shapley value calculation → Modality selection → Client selection → Server aggregation → Model download → Ensemble update

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separate modality vs. end-to-end models: Better handling of missing modalities but potentially less optimal fusion
  - Random Forest vs. neural network ensemble: Better interpretability but possibly lower accuracy
  - Lower loss vs. higher loss client selection: Faster convergence but risk of homogeneity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor accuracy despite low communication: Incorrect modality selection parameters or client selection criteria
  - High communication overhead: γ parameter too large or ineffective client selection
  - Convergence issues: Inappropriate client selection strategy for dataset heterogeneity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run with γ=1, αs=1, αc=0, αr=0 on ActionSense dataset - expect selective communication of highest impact modality
  2. Compare higher vs. lower local loss client selection on UCI-HAR - expect faster convergence with lower loss
  3. Test recency term effect by setting αr=0.5, αs=0.25, αc=0.25 - expect more balanced modality selection over time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between Shapley value impact, communication overhead, and recency for modality selection in different real-world FL scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the need to balance these three metrics and present experiments showing different configurations, but note that the optimal balance depends on the specific application context and data characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that the effectiveness of each metric varies across datasets and that the trade-off is context-dependent, but does not provide a general framework for determining the optimal configuration.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study across diverse FL scenarios with varying communication constraints, data modalities, and application domains to derive guidelines for optimal parameter configuration based on scenario characteristics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does client selection based on lower local loss compare to higher local loss in terms of convergence speed and final model performance across different types of client heterogeneity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare these strategies and show that lower local loss selection generally performs better, but acknowledge that the higher loss strategy may be beneficial in certain scenarios as suggested by previous work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares these strategies in the context of their specific framework and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how different types of client heterogeneity (statistical, individual, group, system) affect the relative performance of these strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments varying types and degrees of client heterogeneity to determine under what conditions each strategy is optimal, potentially leading to a hybrid approach that adapts based on detected heterogeneity patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the mmFedMC framework be extended to dynamically adjust modality and client selection parameters based on real-time network conditions and resource availability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention future work involving dynamic configuration based on network conditions and resource availability, suggesting this is a logical extension of their work.
- Why unresolved: The current framework uses static parameter settings, and while the authors suggest this as future work, they do not explore how such dynamic adaptation could be implemented or its potential benefits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of adaptive algorithms that adjust selection parameters in response to real-time metrics such as available bandwidth, energy levels, and model performance, demonstrating improvements in efficiency or effectiveness compared to static configurations.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness in non-IID settings with severe data imbalance needs further validation
- The assumption of independent modality model learning could break down in highly correlated feature spaces
- The client selection based on local loss may introduce bias toward clients with easier data distributions

## Confidence

- 20x communication reduction claim: Medium confidence - well-supported by experimental results but generalizability uncertain
- Shapley value-based modality selection: Medium confidence - requires careful parameter tuning that may not transfer across domains
- Joint modality and client selection strategy: Medium confidence - demonstrated effectiveness but limited comparison with state-of-the-art compression techniques

## Next Checks

1. Verify Shapley value calculation implementation matches the paper's methodology for modality selection
2. Test client selection strategy with synthetic heterogeneous data to validate convergence behavior
3. Implement parameter sensitivity analysis for γ, αs, αc, and αr across different dataset characteristics
