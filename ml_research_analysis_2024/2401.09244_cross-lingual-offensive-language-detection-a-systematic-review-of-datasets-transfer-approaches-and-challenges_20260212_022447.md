# Cross-lingual Offensive Language Detection: A Systematic Review of Datasets, Transfer Approaches and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.09244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09244
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive systematic review analyzing 67 papers on cross-lingual offensive language detection, categorizing datasets and transfer approaches

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of cross-lingual offensive language detection, analyzing 67 papers published in the field. The review categorizes 82 datasets and transfer approaches across three levels: instance (text/label projection), feature (multilingual embeddings), and parameter (zero-shot, joint, cascade learning). Key findings include the dominance of multilingual PLMs (mBERT, XLM-R), limitations in zero-shot transfer, and the importance of cultural adaptation. The study identifies challenges like low-resource languages, dataset imbalance, and translation quality, while recommending future directions such as incremental annotation, domain-specific PLMs, and integration of additional features (emojis, lexicons). Results show that fine-tuning with small target-language data outperforms pure zero-shot transfer, especially for typologically distant languages.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching multiple databases including Scopus, ACL Anthology, and arXiv. They identified 67 relevant papers through keyword searches and manual screening, extracting information on datasets, transfer approaches, evaluation metrics, and reported results. The analysis categorized approaches into three transfer levels (instance, feature, parameter) and identified 82 distinct datasets used across studies. The review also examined reported challenges and future directions proposed by researchers in the field.

## Key Results
- Multilingual PLMs (mBERT, XLM-R) dominate cross-lingual offensive language detection approaches
- Fine-tuning with small target-language data consistently outperforms pure zero-shot transfer methods
- Typologically distant languages show significantly lower transfer performance compared to related language pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Cross-lingual offensive language detection leverages shared linguistic and cultural patterns across languages. Multilingual PLMs learn universal representations that capture semantic similarities beyond vocabulary, enabling knowledge transfer. The effectiveness stems from three mechanisms: (1) structural similarities in offensive content expression across cultures, (2) shared contextual cues and linguistic patterns in offensive language, and (3) the ability of PLMs to generalize from high-resource to low-resource languages through transfer learning. Cultural adaptation remains crucial as offensive content varies significantly across linguistic communities.

## Foundational Learning
- Multilingual embeddings: Why needed - to represent text in multiple languages in a shared semantic space; Quick check - visualize embedding similarities across language pairs
- Zero-shot transfer: Why needed - to detect offensive content in languages without labeled training data; Quick check - evaluate performance on target language without fine-tuning
- Cross-lingual alignment: Why needed - to ensure consistent representation of offensive content across languages; Quick check - measure semantic similarity of translated offensive examples
- Cultural context modeling: Why needed - offensive content varies significantly across cultures; Quick check - compare detection performance across culturally similar vs. distant languages
- Domain adaptation: Why needed - different platforms/platforms have distinct offensive language patterns; Quick check - evaluate transfer performance across different social media platforms

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Collection -> Dataset Creation -> Transfer Approach Selection -> Model Training -> Evaluation -> Cultural Adaptation

**Critical Path:**
Dataset quality and diversity -> Appropriate transfer approach selection -> Effective cultural adaptation -> Robust evaluation methodology

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Zero-shot vs. few-shot vs. full fine-tuning: balance between resource requirements and performance
- Translation-based vs. direct transfer: trade-off between quality control and scalability
- Generic vs. domain-specific PLMs: balance between coverage and specialization
- Automated vs. human annotation: trade-off between cost and quality

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low performance on typologically distant languages
- High false positive rates in culturally different contexts
- Degradation when moving between domains/platforms
- Sensitivity to translation quality in translation-based approaches

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate zero-shot transfer performance of mBERT across 10 language pairs with varying typological distances
2. Compare few-shot learning (10-100 examples) vs. zero-shot transfer on low-resource languages
3. Assess impact of cultural adaptation by evaluating models trained on one cultural context on data from different cultures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions: How to effectively handle low-resource languages beyond zero-shot transfer? What is the optimal balance between automated and human annotation for dataset creation? How can we better incorporate cultural context into cross-lingual models? What are the ethical implications of offensive language detection across different cultural contexts? How to address the challenge of dataset imbalance across languages and offensive categories?

## Limitations
- Limited to papers published until a specific cutoff date, potentially missing recent developments
- Assessment of translation quality's impact relies on reported observations rather than controlled experiments
- Does not extensively address ethical implications and potential biases in offensive language detection systems

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Categorization of transfer approaches, dominance of mBERT/XLM-R, fine-tuning outperforming zero-shot
- Medium Confidence: Dataset imbalance findings, cultural adaptation importance
- Low Confidence: Future research direction recommendations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning across standardized typologically diverse language pairs
2. Implement meta-analysis of reported results to quantify effect sizes and identify publication bias
3. Develop comprehensive benchmark dataset addressing current dataset imbalances and including low-resource languages
