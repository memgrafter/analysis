# Part-of-Speech Tagger for Bodo Language using Deep Learning approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.03175
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03175
- Reference count: 4
- First neural network-based POS tagger for Bodo language achieving F1 score of 0.8041

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first language model (BodoBERT) and neural network-based POS tagger for the Bodo language. The authors developed BodoBERT using a 1.6 million token corpus and evaluated multiple deep learning architectures for POS tagging, including fine-tuning, CRF, and BiLSTM-CRF. The best-performing model combined BodoBERT with BytePairEmbeddings in a stacked BiLSTM-CRF architecture, achieving an F1 score of 0.8041. Comparative experiments with other language models (FastText, MuRIL, XLM-R, etc.) and on Assamese demonstrated BodoBERT's superior performance, establishing a baseline for future NLP research in Bodo.

## Method Summary
The authors trained BodoBERT using a 1.6 million token corpus and evaluated several deep learning architectures for POS tagging. They experimented with three main approaches: fine-tuning BodoBERT directly, using CRF layers, and combining BiLSTM with CRF. The study compared individual embeddings (BodoBERT, BytePairEmbeddings) and stacked combinations. Data augmentation was performed using 10,000 additional annotated sentences. The annotated dataset consisted of 240,000 tokens from the ILCI-II corpus. All models were evaluated using F1 score on POS tagging tasks.

## Key Results
- BodoBERT + BytePairEmbeddings in stacked BiLSTM-CRF architecture achieved highest F1 score of 0.8041
- Fine-tuning-based models achieved F1 score of 0.7754, CRF-based models achieved 0.7583
- Stacked embeddings improved POS tagging by 2%-7% compared to individual embeddings
- BodoBERT outperformed other language models (FastText, MuRIL, XLM-R, IndicBERT) in cross-lingual experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning a BERT-based language model improves POS tagging accuracy for low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: BERT's pre-training on masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction captures rich contextual representations. Fine-tuning adapts these representations to the specific grammatical structures of Bodo.
- Core assumption: Contextual embeddings learned by BERT generalize well to syntactic tasks like POS tagging, even with limited labeled data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Fine-tuning BodoBERT for POS tagging and comparing it to other architectures
  - [section] Fine-tuning-based and CRF-based models achieved F1 scores of 0.7754 and 0.7583 respectively, outperformed by BiLSTM-CRF

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stacked embeddings combining a language model with subword embeddings improve POS tagging accuracy.
- Mechanism: BodoBERT captures contextual semantics while BytePairEmbeddings capture subword-level morphological information. Combining both provides richer input representations for the BiLSTM-CRF tagger.
- Core assumption: Subword-level information (e.g., prefixes, suffixes) is complementary to contextual embeddings for morphological-rich languages like Bodo.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Highest F1 score of 0.8041 achieved using BodoBERT+BytePairEmbeddings in stacked BiLSTM-CRF
  - [section] Stacked embeddings improved POS tagging by 2%-7% compared to individual embeddings

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large pre-training corpora are essential for building effective language models for low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: BodoBERT was trained on 1.6 million tokens from multiple domains, enabling the model to learn robust representations for downstream tasks.
- Core assumption: A corpus of at least 1.6 million tokens is sufficient to capture the linguistic features of Bodo for language modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Authors collected 1.6 million tokens from various domains to train BodoBERT
  - [section] Corpus described as "monolingual training corpus" prepared from "various sources" and "different domains"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tokenization and subword segmentation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how BytePairEmbeddings and WordPiece tokenizer work is critical for interpreting embedding combinations and handling out-of-vocabulary words
  - Quick check question: How does BytePairEmbeddings handle unseen words during inference?

- Concept: Sequence labeling and CRFs
  - Why needed here: POS tagging is a sequence labeling task, and CRF layers model dependencies between adjacent tags, improving prediction coherence
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using a CRF layer over independent tag predictions?

- Concept: Fine-tuning vs. feature extraction
  - Why needed here: The paper compares fine-tuning BERT vs. using it as a fixed feature extractor in different architectures
  - Quick check question: When is it preferable to freeze BERT embeddings rather than fine-tune them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw Bodo text → WordPiece Tokenizer + BytePairEmbeddings → Stacked Embeddings → BiLSTM Encoder → CRF Decoder → POS tags
- Critical path: Embedding → BiLSTM → CRF → POS tags
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-tuning BERT gives better adaptation but requires more compute
  - Stacked embeddings increase model complexity but improve performance
  - Larger corpora improve model quality but increase training time
- Failure signatures:
  - Low F1 score with high precision but low recall → overfitting to training set
  - Confusion between similar tags (e.g., N_NN vs N_NNP) → dataset labeling issues or insufficient context
  - Slow convergence → learning rate or batch size mismatch
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune BodoBERT alone on POS tagging and evaluate F1 score
  2. Replace fine-tuning with fixed BodoBERT embeddings + CRF and compare performance
  3. Combine BodoBERT + BytePairEmbeddings in a stacked BiLSTM-CRF architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of using larger training corpora on the performance of BodoBERT and the Bodo POS tagger?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the size of the training corpus impacts the quality of language models and that BodoBERT was trained on 1.6 million tokens. It also states that the dataset size may not be adequate for optimal performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the effects of using larger training corpora on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training BodoBERT and the POS tagger on progressively larger corpora and comparing the performance improvements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of BodoBERT compare to language models trained on other morphologically rich languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares BodoBERT to other language models (FastText, MuRIL, XLM-R, etc.) but does not compare it to models trained on other morphologically rich languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing BodoBERT to general-purpose language models rather than those specifically trained on morphologically rich languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating language models on other morphologically rich languages and comparing their performance to BodoBERT on similar downstream tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the effect of incorporating additional linguistic features, such as morphological information, into the Bodo POS tagger?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the morphological richness of Bodo and mentions common errors in POS tagging related to noun classification. It does not explore the use of morphological features in the tagging model.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the impact of incorporating morphological information into the POS tagging model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different POS tagging architectures that incorporate morphological features and comparing their performance to the current model.

## Limitations

- Limited annotated dataset size (240k tokens) may restrict generalizability of results
- Lack of detailed hyperparameter settings makes exact reproduction challenging
- Comparison limited to small set of pre-trained models without extensive ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that BodoBERT + BytePairEmbeddings in a stacked BiLSTM-CRF architecture achieves the highest F1 score (0.8041) for Bodo POS tagging
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that BodoBERT outperforms other pre-trained language models for Bodo POS tagging
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that this work establishes a baseline for future NLP research in Bodo

## Next Checks

1. Cross-linguistic validation: Test BodoBERT's performance on POS tagging for other low-resource languages to verify its generalizability beyond Bodo

2. Ablation study: Conduct a detailed ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of BodoBERT, BytePairEmbeddings, and the BiLSTM-CRF architecture to overall performance

3. Error analysis: Perform detailed error analysis to identify specific POS tagging errors and their patterns, particularly for challenging tag distinctions mentioned in the paper (N_NN vs N_NNP)
