# OCMDP: Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.07087
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07087
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: Achieves up to 50% reduction in observation costs while maintaining or improving control performance through iterative policy decomposition

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP) to address the challenge of learning both observation and control strategies in cost-sensitive environments. The key idea is decomposing the combined sensing and control policy through an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning approach. Experiments on a simulated diagnostic chain task and HeartPole healthcare environment demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial reductions in observation costs - up to 50% compared to fixed strategies - while maintaining or improving control performance. The method shows relative improvements of 71% in expected cumulative reward on the diagnostic task and 75% over baseline RL algorithms on HeartPole.

## Method Summary
The proposed OCMDP framework extends traditional MDP/POMDP by allowing the agent to control when and what to observe, with each observation action incurring a cost. The authors develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. The approach uses a belief state representation derived from observation history to maintain knowledge about the environment, and alternates between optimizing the control policy (given a fixed observation policy) and the observation policy (given a fixed control policy). This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space without requiring environment dynamics models.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 50% reduction in observation costs compared to fixed observation strategies
- Shows 71% relative improvement in expected cumulative reward on the diagnostic chain task
- Demonstrates 75% improvement over baseline RL algorithms on the HeartPole healthcare environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The iterative optimization framework successfully decouples observation and control policies, enabling efficient learning in the expanded action space.
- Mechanism: By alternating between optimizing the control policy while holding the observation policy fixed, and vice versa, the algorithm avoids the curse of dimensionality that would arise from simultaneously optimizing over all possible observation-control action pairs.
- Core assumption: The policy decomposition is valid and that improvements in one policy component do not degrade the other when the fixed policy is suboptimal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy"
  - [section] "This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations to similar iterative decomposition approaches in the corpus
- Break condition: If the control and observation decisions are highly coupled such that optimizing one without considering the other leads to suboptimal joint policies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The belief state representation allows the agent to maintain and update its knowledge about the environment despite costly observations.
- Mechanism: The belief state bt is derived from the history ht through a neural network, providing a compressed representation of the agent's knowledge that conditions both observation and control policy decisions.
- Core assumption: The belief state extractor can accurately infer the true state from the observation history, and this representation is sufficient for making good decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Since the full state at time t, i.e., st, is costly to observe, the agent may maintain a belief state bt ∈ M(S), which is updated based on the history ht and encapsulates the agent's knowledge about the environment"
  - [section] "At time t, the belief state bt is derived from the history ht through the function bt = fψ(ht)"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about belief state effectiveness for OCMDP problems
- Break condition: If the belief state extractor fails to accurately infer the true state, leading to poor decision-making despite optimal observation selection.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model-free approach avoids the need for environment dynamics models, making it practical for real-world applications.
- Mechanism: By using policy gradient methods and trajectory-based value functions, the algorithm learns directly from experience without requiring a model of the transition function T or observation function Z.
- Core assumption: The policy gradient estimates are accurate enough to guide the optimization process toward good policies despite the lack of a model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics"
  - [section] "To tackle this challenge, we propose an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning approach that decomposes the sensing and control policies"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about model-free vs model-based performance for similar problems
- Break condition: If the sample complexity becomes prohibitively high in complex environments, making the model-free approach impractical compared to model-based alternatives.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: OCMDP extends POMDP by allowing the agent to influence observability, so understanding POMDP foundations is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a POMDP and an OCMDP in terms of observation actions?

- Concept: Policy Gradient Methods
  - Why needed here: The algorithm uses policy gradient optimization for both observation and control policies
  - Quick check question: How does the policy gradient theorem enable optimization of parameterized policies in high-dimensional spaces?

- Concept: Belief State Representation
  - Why needed here: The belief state is central to maintaining knowledge about the environment when full observability is costly
  - Quick check question: Why might a learned belief state representation be preferable to a handcrafted one in complex environments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Belief state extractor (ψ) -> Observation policy (ϕ) -> Environment -> Belief state extractor (ψ) -> Control policy (θ) -> Environment
- Critical path: Environment → Belief State → Observation Policy → Environment → Belief State → Control Policy → Environment
- Design tradeoffs: Model-free vs model-based approaches (simplicity vs sample efficiency), belief state complexity vs computational cost
- Failure signatures: Poor belief state accuracy, slow convergence due to coupled policy optimization, suboptimal observation selection
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Diagnostic Chain task with varying observation costs to test cost-benefit tradeoffs
  2. HeartPole task with different reward structures to evaluate adaptability
  3. Ablation study comparing with and without belief state component to measure its impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the OCMDP approach scale to environments with continuous observation actions or high-dimensional observation spaces?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explicitly mentions that the proposed approach is demonstrated on binary observation actions and discusses the curse of dimensionality with exponential growth in action space (2^|O| × |A_control|), but does not explore continuous or high-dimensional observation scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The current formulation and experiments are limited to discrete, binary observation decisions, leaving scalability to continuous observation spaces unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating OCMDP performance on continuous observation actions or high-dimensional observation spaces, along with analysis of computational complexity and learning efficiency in these settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the theoretical convergence guarantees when applying the iterative optimization approach to more complex POMDP variants beyond OCMDP?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides theoretical analysis of iterative policy optimization convergence for OCMDP, but acknowledges that exhaustively searching the entire policy space is computationally infeasible and focuses on locally optimal solutions.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis is specific to OCMDP and does not extend to other POMDP variants or more complex partially observable environments with different structure or dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal proofs of convergence properties for the iterative optimization approach applied to various POMDP variants, including non-stationary environments or those with non-Markovian observations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the OCMDP performance to hyperparameter choices such as the discount factor γ and observation cost function C?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper mentions these parameters in the formalism (γ ∈ [0,1) and C: A_o → R≥0), there is no systematic sensitivity analysis of how performance varies with different choices of these parameters.
- Why unresolved: The experimental results use fixed parameter values without exploring the parameter space or analyzing robustness to parameter variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive sensitivity analysis showing OCMDP performance across a range of γ values and different cost function formulations, including how these choices affect the trade-off between observation costs and control performance.

## Limitations
- The belief state representation assumes the history can be effectively compressed into a belief that captures all relevant information for decision-making
- The iterative optimization approach lacks rigorous convergence and optimality guarantees
- Experimental evaluation is limited to two domains, which may not capture the full range of challenges in real-world cost-sensitive environments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The formulation of OCMDP as an extension of MDP/POMDP with controllable observability is mathematically sound and well-defined.
- **Medium confidence**: The iterative model-free learning approach is likely effective based on the reported experimental results, but the sample efficiency and scalability to more complex environments remain uncertain.
- **Low confidence**: The belief state representation's ability to capture sufficient information for optimal decision-making in general settings is not well-validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Analysis**: Conduct experiments varying the initialization and order of policy updates to assess whether the iterative optimization consistently converges to similar performance levels across different runs.

2. **Belief State Ablation**: Compare the proposed method against variants that use different belief state representations (e.g., handcrafted vs learned, different neural network architectures) to quantify the impact of the belief state component on overall performance.

3. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate the algorithm on more complex environments with larger state and observation spaces to assess its practical scalability and identify potential bottlenecks in the learning process.
