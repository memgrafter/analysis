# SupplyGraph: A Benchmark Dataset for Supply Chain Planning using Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15299
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15299
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: GNN models achieve lower RMSE (27.98-28.18) compared to ARMA (37.99-37.45) in demand and production forecasting on the SupplyGraph dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SupplyGraph, a real-world benchmark dataset for applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to supply chain planning. The dataset contains 41 products as nodes and 684 edges representing relationships like shared production facilities and storage locations. Temporal node features include production, sales orders, delivery to distributors, and factory issues. Experiments demonstrate that GNN-based models like DCRNN, TGCN, and GConvGRU outperform traditional approaches in demand forecasting, production planning, product classification, anomaly detection, and product relation prediction.

## Method Summary
The authors created SupplyGraph by modeling products as nodes and their relationships as edges in a temporal graph. They used PyTorch Geometric and PyTorch Geometric Temporal libraries to implement various GNN architectures (DCRNN, TGCN, GConvGRU, GCN, GAT) and traditional methods (ARMA, GRU, LSTM) for comparison. Models were trained for 200 epochs with early stopping on an 8:2 train-test split of the temporal data.

## Key Results
- GNN models achieve lower RMSE (27.98-28.18) compared to ARMA (37.99-37.45) in demand and production forecasting
- GCN and GAT models outperform logistic regression in product classification tasks
- GDN-based GNN models show improved precision and recall in anomaly detection compared to traditional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph Neural Networks exploit the inherent graph structure of supply chains to model complex interdependencies between products, production facilities, and storage locations.
- Mechanism: By representing products as nodes and their relationships (shared facilities, product groups) as edges, GNNs propagate information across the graph to capture both local and global supply chain dynamics, enabling better predictions than traditional time-series models.
- Core assumption: Supply chain relationships are sufficiently captured by the chosen graph structure and edge types in SupplyGraph.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies."
  - [section] "Our dataset's structural design models products as nodes, while the interrelationships, such as shared product groups, sub-groups, production facilities, and storage locations, are represented as edge connections."
  - [corpus] Found related papers focusing on applying GNNs to SupplyGraph, confirming the approach's relevance.
- Break condition: If the chosen graph structure fails to capture critical supply chain dynamics not represented by the current edges (e.g., supplier-supplier relationships, geopolitical factors), GNN performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temporal GNN models outperform traditional time-series models in demand forecasting and production planning by incorporating both temporal patterns and graph-based dependencies.
- Mechanism: GNN models like DCRNN, TGCN, and GConvGRU use the graph structure to share information between related products while also modeling temporal dynamics, leading to more accurate predictions than models like ARMA that treat each product independently.
- Core assumption: The temporal patterns in supply chain data are sufficiently regular to be captured by the chosen GNN architectures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments demonstrate that GNN-based models like DCRNN, TGCN, and GConvGRU outperform traditional approaches in demand forecasting, production planning, product classification, anomaly detection, and product relation prediction."
  - [section] "In demand prediction... the recurrent models, particularly DCRNN and TGCN, outperform ARMA, demonstrating the benefits of leveraging sequential information with GNNs."
  - [corpus] Related papers apply GNNs to SupplyGraph for similar tasks, validating the approach.
- Break condition: If temporal patterns are highly irregular or dominated by external factors not captured in the data, the GNN's advantage over simpler models will diminish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The SupplyGraph dataset enables benchmarking of GNN models on real-world supply chain problems, accelerating research in this domain.
- Mechanism: By providing a real-world dataset with temporal node features and graph structure, SupplyGraph allows researchers to train and evaluate GNN models on tasks like demand forecasting, production planning, and anomaly detection, establishing baselines and comparing approaches.
- Core assumption: The dataset is sufficiently representative of real supply chain challenges and diverse enough to support generalizable conclusions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The dataset fills a gap in the literature by providing a dedicated resource for GNN research in supply chain applications, enabling advancements in optimization, prediction, and problem-solving."
  - [section] "Our contributions are summarized into three folds: We have introduced a new benchmark dataset for GNN problem-solving in supply chain planning, raising the bar for research and real-world applications."
  - [corpus] Limited citation data (0) in related papers suggests early stage of research building on this dataset.
- Break condition: If the dataset is too small, too specific to one company's operations, or lacks diversity in supply chain scenarios, its generalizability and benchmarking value will be limited.

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between spectral and spatial GNN approaches, and when might each be preferred for supply chain applications?

- Concept: Time Series Forecasting
  - Why needed here: Supply chain planning requires accurate predictions of demand and production, which are inherently temporal tasks.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of traditional time series models like ARMA when applied to supply chain forecasting, and how do GNNs address these limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SupplyGraph dataset -> GNN models (DCRNN, TGCN, GConvGRU, GCN, GAT) -> Task-specific outputs
- Critical path: Load and preprocess SupplyGraph data -> Define task-specific model architectures -> Train models using temporal graph convolutions -> Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics -> Analyze results and iterate
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Homogenous vs. heterogeneous graphs: Homogenous graphs simplify modeling but may miss important distinctions between node types
  - Temporal resolution: Higher resolution data may capture more patterns but increases computational complexity
  - Graph size: Larger graphs may capture more complex relationships but require more computational resources
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on known relationships: May indicate insufficient graph structure or model capacity
  - Overfitting on training data: May suggest need for regularization or more diverse training data
  - Failure to generalize to new products: May indicate need for better representation learning or transfer learning approaches
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Demand forecasting comparison: Train DCRNN, TGCN, and GConvGRU on demand prediction task; compare RMSE against ARMA baseline
  2. Product classification: Train GCN and GAT models to classify products by group; compare accuracy against logistic regression baseline
  3. Anomaly detection: Implement GDN model for anomaly detection; evaluate precision and recall on identified anomalies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing hypergraph-based models on the SupplyGraph dataset and comparing their performance to traditional graph-based models on tasks like demand forecasting, product classification, and anomaly detection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal approach for handling data scarcity in supply chain GNN models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that improved forecasting can be achieved by applying transfer learning across nodes of the same classification in data-scarce scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of different approaches for handling data scarcity, such as data augmentation, meta-learning, or few-shot learning techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation comparing the performance of GNN models using different techniques for handling data scarcity, such as transfer learning, data augmentation, or meta-learning, on the SupplyGraph dataset.
