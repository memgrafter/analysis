# Denoising with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.03755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03755
- Reference count: 40
- D-JEPA achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet conditional generation benchmarks

## Executive Summary
D-JEPA introduces a novel generative model that combines Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with diffusion modeling for continuous data generation. The key innovation lies in reinterpreting masked image modeling as a generalized next-token prediction strategy, enabling both autoregressive and continuous-space generation. By incorporating diffusion loss to model per-token probability distributions, D-JEPA demonstrates superior performance across multiple model scales and extends to video and audio synthesis.

## Method Summary
The method integrates JEPA's contrastive learning framework with diffusion modeling principles. The architecture treats masked image modeling as a continuous prediction task where each token's probability distribution is modeled using diffusion or flow matching losses. This approach allows the model to learn robust representations while maintaining the ability to generate high-quality samples. The training process leverages conditional generation objectives, where the model learns to predict masked tokens given their context, effectively bridging the gap between discrete autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet conditional generation benchmarks across all model scales
- Demonstrates superior scalability with fewer training epochs required as model size increases
- Shows significant improvements in FID scores and competitive Inception Scores compared to previous generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of D-JEPA stems from its unified approach to generation tasks. By combining JEPA's contrastive learning with diffusion modeling, the architecture benefits from both robust representation learning and high-quality sample generation. The generalized next-token prediction framework allows the model to handle both discrete and continuous data spaces effectively. The diffusion loss provides stable training dynamics while enabling fine-grained control over the generation process, resulting in superior sample quality and diversity.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**
   - Why needed: Provides robust representation learning through contrastive objectives
   - Quick check: Verify the contrastive loss formulation and embedding space properties

2. **Diffusion Modeling**
   - Why needed: Enables stable training and high-quality sample generation
   - Quick check: Confirm the noise schedule and sampling procedure

3. **Masked Image Modeling**
   - Why needed: Provides a unified framework for both autoregressive and continuous generation
   - Quick check: Validate the masking strategy and token prediction accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
D-JEPA -> Encoder -> Context Model -> Diffusion Head -> Decoder

**Critical Path:**
Input → Encoder → Context Model → Diffusion Head → Sampling → Decoder → Output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The architecture balances representation quality (JEPA) with generation quality (diffusion). The choice of diffusion loss versus flow matching loss affects training stability and sample diversity. The masking strategy impacts both computational efficiency and generation quality.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor sample quality indicates issues with either the contrastive learning component or the diffusion modeling. Mode collapse suggests problems with the context modeling or sampling strategy. High computational costs may indicate inefficient masking or sampling procedures.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate contrastive learning performance on representation tasks
2. Test diffusion sampling quality with synthetic data
3. Evaluate masked token prediction accuracy on validation set
