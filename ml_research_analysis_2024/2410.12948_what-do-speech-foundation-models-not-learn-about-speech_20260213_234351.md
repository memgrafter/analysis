# What Do Speech Foundation Models Not Learn About Speech?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12948
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12948
- Authors: Abdul Waheed; Hanin Atwany; Bhiksha Raj; Rita Singh
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Speech foundation models show varying capabilities in capturing non-verbal speech cues, with emotion recognition and stress detection remaining particularly challenging tasks.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates speech foundation models' ability to capture non-verbal speech cues across paralinguistic and non-paralinguistic tasks. Five prominent models (Whisper, Seamless, Wav2Vec, HuBERT, and Qwen2-Audio) are assessed on ten tasks from the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark using zero-shot evaluation and layer-wise feature extraction. The results reveal that while some models perform well on tasks like multi-speaker detection and accent classification, emotion recognition and stress detection remain challenging. The analysis demonstrates that zero-shot performance correlates with better-learned representations, and a convex relationship exists between representation separability and model depth in several models.

## Method Summary
The study employs zero-shot evaluation of five speech foundation models on ten Dynamic-SUPERB tasks, using both text prompts and layer-wise feature extraction. Models are evaluated using KNN and Neural Network classifiers with 5-fold cross-validation, measuring performance through Macro-F1 scores and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). The analysis examines how different architectures and pre-training approaches affect the models' ability to capture various speech cues, with particular attention to the evolution of representations across model layers.

## Key Results
- Models like Whisper and Qwen2-Audio excel at multi-speaker detection and accent classification but struggle with emotion recognition and stress detection
- Zero-shot performance correlates with better-learned representations across layers
- A convex relationship between representation separability and model depth is observed in several models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-shot performance correlates with better-learned representations across layers
- Mechanism: Models that generalize well in zero-shot settings possess internal representations already discriminative for target tasks, allowing direct mapping from speech inputs to outputs using pre-trained knowledge
- Core assumption: Pre-training objectives create representations capturing general speech characteristics relevant to multiple downstream tasks
- Evidence anchors: Abstract findings on model performance despite lack of explicit training; section 5.1 findings on task-specific performance variations
- Break condition: Narrow or domain-specific pre-training objectives may fail to generalize to unseen tasks

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Earlier layers capture more generalizable features while later layers contain more task-specific information
- Mechanism: Hierarchical transformer structure means initial layers learn basic speech patterns (phonetics, prosody) broadly applicable, while deeper layers refine these into specialized representations
- Core assumption: Model architecture progressively transforms input features from general to specific representations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract findings on convex relationship between layer depth and representation separability; section 5.4 findings on performance evolution across layers
- Break condition: Non-hierarchical architectures or training objectives that don't encourage progressive feature refinement

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different model architectures and pre-training approaches lead to varying capabilities across speech tasks
- Mechanism: Architecture choices (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) and diverse pre-training data shape each model's strengths for specific speech tasks
- Core assumption: Model architecture and training strategy fundamentally determine learned representation types
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.2 selection of models with distinct architectures and objectives; section 5.5 findings on architecture importance
- Break condition: Extensive fine-tuning on downstream tasks may diminish original architectural differences

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Understanding speech foundation models requires knowledge of transformer-based architectures that form the basis of all studied models
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention in transformers help capture long-range dependencies in speech signals?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning in speech processing
  - Why needed here: Most speech foundation models use self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled audio data, crucial for understanding representation learning without explicit supervision
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between contrastive learning and masked prediction approaches in speech self-supervised learning?

- Concept: Layer-wise feature analysis and probing techniques
  - Why needed here: The study systematically extracts and analyzes features from different model layers, requiring understanding of probing and interpreting intermediate representations
  - Quick check question: How can we quantify information content at different layers using techniques like normalized mutual information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw audio -> Spectrogram/feature extraction -> Encoder layers (hierarchical feature learning) -> Pooling mechanisms (mean pooling) -> Classifier heads (KNN/NN) -> Task-specific predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained model using HuggingFace
  2. Extract layer-wise features from input speech
  3. Standardize features for numerical stability
  4. Train KNN and NN classifiers on extracted features
  5. Evaluate using cross-validation and F1 scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning: Zero-shot testing generalization but may underperform on complex tasks
  - KNN vs. NN classifiers: KNN shows raw feature quality, NN shows potential for adaptation
  - Layer selection: Earlier layers capture general features, later layers capture task-specific information

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor zero-shot performance across all tasks suggests inadequate pre-training
  - Layer-wise performance that doesn't improve with depth indicates shallow feature learning
  - High variance across cross-validation folds suggests unstable representations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract features from all layers of Whisper-large-v3 and visualize layer-wise F1 scores for MultiSpeakerDetection
  2. Compare zero-shot performance of Whisper vs. Qwen2-Audio on IntentClassification using different prompts
  3. Analyze t-SNE embeddings of Wav2Vec layer 1 vs layer 25 to visualize representation evolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different speech foundation models' layer-wise representations differ in their ability to capture non-verbal speech cues like emotion and stress?
- Basis in paper: The paper explicitly states that models like Whisper and Qwen2-Audio performed well on tasks like multi-speaker detection and accent classification, but emotion recognition and stress detection remained challenging. It also mentions that the analysis of layer-wise features demonstrated a convex relationship between representation separability and model depth for some models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of how each model's layer-wise representations specifically capture different types of non-verbal cues, nor does it explain the underlying reasons for the convex relationship observed in some models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of each model's layer-wise representations for different non-verbal cues, including visualization and quantitative measures of representation separability, would help understand the differences and the reasons behind the observed patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of prompt sensitivity on the zero-shot performance of speech foundation models for non-verbal speech tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that some models are sensitive to prompt type, with performance varying across tasks. It provides examples of how different prompts affected the performance of Whisper-large-v2 and Whisper-medium.en.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the underlying reasons for prompt sensitivity or explore methods to mitigate its impact on zero-shot performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study of prompt design and its impact on model performance, including analysis of the relationship between prompt structure and model interpretability of non-verbal cues, would help understand and address prompt sensitivity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the learned representations of speech foundation models compare to handcrafted audio features like MFCC in capturing non-verbal speech cues?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that nearly all models capture better audio features than the best Librosa feature (MFCC), as shown in Figure 2.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the specific advantages and disadvantages of learned representations versus handcrafted features for different non-verbal speech tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis comparing the performance of learned representations and handcrafted features across a wide range of non-verbal speech tasks, including tasks where handcrafted features might still be superior, would help understand the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## Limitations

- Zero-shot evaluation approach may underestimate model capabilities since some tasks could benefit from fine-tuning
- Layer-wise analysis doesn't account for potential interference between layers during end-to-end inference
- Study focuses on a specific set of five models and ten tasks, which may not represent full diversity of speech foundation models or paralinguistic cues

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Different model architectures exhibit varying capabilities across speech tasks; zero-shot performance correlates with learned representations
- **Medium Confidence:** Convex relationship between layer depth and representation separability shows consistent patterns but may be influenced by architectural choices
- **Low Confidence:** Direct comparisons between zero-shot and fine-tuned performance are limited

## Next Checks

1. Conduct fine-tuning experiments on the most challenging tasks (emotion recognition, stress detection) to establish upper bounds on model performance and compare with zero-shot results to quantify the generalization gap
2. Perform ablation studies by training models with different pre-training objectives (contrastive vs. masked prediction) on the same architecture to isolate the impact of training methodology on paralinguistic feature learning
3. Extend the layer-wise analysis to include intermediate attention weight visualization and feature attribution methods to better understand which speech components (pitch, energy, duration) contribute most to task performance at different depths
