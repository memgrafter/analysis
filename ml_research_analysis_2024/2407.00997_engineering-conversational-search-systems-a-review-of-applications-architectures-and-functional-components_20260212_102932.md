# Engineering Conversational Search Systems: A Review of Applications, Architectures, and Functional Components

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.00997
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00997
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents a layered architecture framework and core functions for conversational search systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic literature review of conversational search systems, identifying key system properties, architectures, and functional components. The authors propose a layered architecture framework comprising six layers: knowledge, natural language understanding, dialogue management, natural language generation, conversational interface, and search. They identify seven core functions of conversational search systems: query classification, reformulation, clarification, suggestion, candidate retrieval, re-ranking, and knowledge-based response generation. The paper discusses how large language models can augment these systems while highlighting challenges and risks such as computational resources, hallucinations, and lack of transparency. The proposed framework provides a foundation for designing and developing conversational search systems, and the authors outline promising directions for future research.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 25 papers related to conversational search systems, extracting system architectures, functional components, and implementation approaches. They consolidated architectures into a layered framework with six distinct layers, each handling specific roles in the conversational search pipeline. The methodology involved identifying core functions across systems, analyzing their implementation patterns, and synthesizing these findings into a generalizable architecture. The review particularly examined how large language models could augment conversational search capabilities through prompt-based learning approaches.

## Key Results
- Consolidated conversational search architectures into a six-layer framework with modular components
- Identified seven core functions: query classification, reformulation, clarification, suggestion, candidate retrieval, re-ranking, and knowledge-based response generation
- Discussed opportunities and challenges of integrating large language models into conversational search systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The layered architecture separates concerns across six distinct layers to manage the complexity of conversational search.
- Mechanism: Each layer (knowledge, NLU, dialogue management, NLG, conversational interface, search) handles a specific role, with modules grouping related functional components. This separation allows for independent implementation and replacement of components within modules.
- Core assumption: The layered pattern provides a generalizable framework that can be adapted to various application scenarios with different interface modalities and data structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We consolidate reoccurring elements into the generalized CSS architecture displayed in Figure 1. The proposed architecture adopts a layered architecture pattern, where each of the six layers performs a specific role within the CSS."
  - [abstract]: "We consolidate our results by presenting a layered architecture framework and explaining the core functions of conversational search systems."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers, but none specifically address the layered architecture pattern as the core mechanism. Weak evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: The architecture fails if components within a layer become too interdependent, violating the separation of concerns principle.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Large language models (LLMs) can augment conversational search systems by handling multiple tasks without specific training through prompt-based learning.
- Mechanism: LLMs leverage their language understanding and context-aware response generation capabilities to enhance query understanding, reformulation, clarification, and response generation. They can be prompted to perform multiple tasks within the NLU, dialogue management, and NLG layers.
- Core assumption: LLMs' emergent capabilities from scaling up models and training on large corpora make them effective for multi-task learning in conversational search.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Through carefully defined prompts, LLMs can perform multiple tasks without specific training or tuning (Liu et al., 2023)."
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we reflect on our findings in light of the rapid progress in large language models, discussing their capabilities, limitations, and directions for future research."
  - [corpus]: Found related papers discussing LLMs in conversational search, but specific mechanisms of prompt-based learning for multiple tasks are not detailed. Weak evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: The augmentation fails if LLMs exhibit hallucinations, lack transparency, or require excessive computational resources that hinder real-time response.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The pipeline-based architecture with replaceable NLP models allows for flexible and modular implementation of conversational search systems.
- Mechanism: The architecture consists of modules implemented in a generic form, where each module (e.g., query pre-processing, ranking, response generation) can be replaced with different NLP models. This allows for easy integration of new techniques and adaptation to specific application needs.
- Core assumption: The modular design enables experimentation with different NLP models for each component without affecting the overall system architecture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "An example of a pipeline-based architecture is the open-source framework called Macaw from Zamani and Craswell (2020). It consists of three modules implemented in a generic form with replaceable NLP models."
  - [abstract]: "We consolidate architectures from the literature into a layered architecture framework and elaborate on the core functional components of CSSs."
  - [corpus]: Found papers discussing modular architectures and replaceable components, but specific examples of Macaw or similar frameworks are not mentioned. Weak evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: The architecture fails if the pipeline becomes too rigid, preventing the integration of more advanced end-to-end approaches or if error propagation between modules becomes significant.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information Retrieval Basics
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional IR concepts like ranking, relevance, and query processing is essential for grasping how conversational search systems extend these ideas to handle natural language interactions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) and dense retrieval in the context of information retrieval?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing Fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with NLP techniques such as tokenization, named entity recognition, intent detection, and semantic parsing is crucial for understanding how conversational search systems process and understand user queries.
  - Quick check question: How does named entity recognition contribute to query understanding in conversational search systems?

- Concept: Dialogue System Architecture
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of dialogue system components like dialogue state tracking, policy learning, and response generation is necessary for understanding the dialogue management layer in conversational search architectures.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of dialogue state tracking in managing the conversation flow within a conversational search system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Knowledge Layer: Knowledge bases, APIs, structured/unstructured data sources
  - NLU Layer: Utterance understanding, intent detection, entity recognition, query pre-processing
  - Dialogue Management Layer: Context and dialogue management, policy learning, action selection
  - NLG Layer: Response generation (retrieval-based, rule-based, generative, hybrid methods)
  - Conversational Interface Layer: Multimodal interface, voice interface, text interface
  - Search Layer: Candidate retrieval, candidate re-ranking, knowledge-based response generation

- Critical path: User query → Conversational Interface → NLU (query classification, reformulation, clarification) → Dialogue Management (context handling) → Search (retrieval, re-ranking) → NLG (response generation) → Conversational Interface (output)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pipeline vs. End-to-end: Pipeline allows modular development and easier debugging but may suffer from error propagation. End-to-end can learn task-specific representations but may lack interpretability.
  - Sparse vs. Dense Retrieval: Sparse retrieval is computationally efficient but limited in handling synonyms and word order. Dense retrieval addresses these issues but requires more computational resources.
  - Template-based vs. Generative Response: Template-based ensures consistency and control but lacks flexibility. Generative methods are more natural but may introduce errors or hallucinations.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor query understanding: Misinterpretation of user intent, failure to resolve co-references or ambiguities
  - Inadequate dialogue management: Loss of conversation context, inappropriate system responses
  - Suboptimal retrieval: Irrelevant or low-quality search results, failure to rank relevant items highly
  - Response generation issues: Grammatical errors, lack of coherence, hallucinations or factual inaccuracies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple query classification component using a pre-trained BERT model to classify user queries into different intent categories.
  2. Develop a query reformulation module that uses a sequence-to-sequence transformer to rewrite ambiguous queries into explicit forms, incorporating context from the conversation history.
  3. Create a basic response generation component that retrieves relevant passages from a knowledge base and generates a natural language summary using a T5 model fine-tuned on conversational QA data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective architectural patterns for integrating large language models into conversational search systems while minimizing computational overhead?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses opportunities and challenges of augmenting CSSs with LLMs, mentioning computational resources as a major concern.
- Why unresolved: While the paper outlines several optimization techniques (model distillation, quantization, low-rank adaptation), it doesn't provide empirical comparisons of their effectiveness in the context of conversational search.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance and efficiency of different LLM integration strategies specifically for conversational search tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can conversational search systems effectively balance the trade-off between providing clarifying questions and maintaining user engagement?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that systems must ensure a user's patience or tolerance is not running out by asking too many questions, but doesn't provide concrete guidelines for achieving this balance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges this challenge, it doesn't offer specific methodologies or metrics for measuring and optimizing this balance in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies and A/B testing results demonstrating optimal frequencies and types of clarifying questions across different conversational search scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the key factors that determine the suitability of different search modalities (text, speech, hybrid) for specific conversational search tasks and user contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various search modalities and their impact on user information gain, but doesn't provide a comprehensive framework for modality selection.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies some modality-specific advantages and disadvantages, it doesn't offer a systematic approach for choosing the most appropriate modality based on task complexity, user expertise, or environmental factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing user performance and satisfaction across different modalities for various conversational search tasks under controlled conditions.

## Limitations
- The literature review identified 25 papers, but the architecture synthesis relies heavily on interpretation rather than comprehensive implementation details.
- Specific implementation details for LLM integration and evaluation metrics require further empirical validation.
- The layered architecture pattern as a generalizable framework is plausible but not extensively validated across diverse application scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The identification of core functional components (query classification, reformulation, clarification, etc.) is well-supported by multiple sources in the literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The layered architecture pattern as a generalizable framework is plausible but not extensively validated across diverse application scenarios.
- **Low confidence**: Specific implementation details for LLM integration and evaluation metrics for conversational search systems require further empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Implement a prototype conversational search system using the six-layer architecture and evaluate its performance on a standard benchmark dataset like TREC CAsT, comparing it against baseline approaches.

2. Conduct controlled experiments to measure the effectiveness of LLM-augmented components (query understanding, reformulation, response generation) versus traditional NLP models, quantifying improvements in retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction.

3. Perform a user study to assess the impact of different response generation methods (template-based, retrieval-based, generative) on user comprehension and task completion in conversational search scenarios.
