# Development of Cognitive Intelligence in Pre-trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01047
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01047
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Large PLMs develop cognitive abilities through experience alone, exhibiting a window of monotonic development early in training before performance plateaus, suggesting they may not serve as ideal models for understanding human cognitive development beyond early stages.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large pre-trained language models (PLMs) develop cognitive abilities in ways that align with human cognitive development. The authors evaluate PLMs across four psychometric domains - numeric abilities, linguistic abilities, conceptual understanding, and fluid reasoning - using representative psychometric tasks. Their analysis reveals that PLMs acquire these cognitive abilities through experience during training, showing improved performance on psychometric tasks during early training phases. However, they observe a distinct "window of monotonic development" early in training, after which performance plateaus despite continued training. This suggests that beyond this developmental window, further training serves engineering objectives rather than enhancing cognitive alignment with human development.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate PLMs across four psychometric domains using representative psychometric tasks to assess cognitive and developmental alignment. They analyze PLM performance trajectories during training to determine whether they align with human cognitive development patterns. The study focuses on identifying developmental windows where monotonic improvement occurs and examining what happens after performance plateaus.

## Key Results
- PLMs develop cognitive abilities through experience alone, showing improved performance on psychometric tasks during early training phases
- A "window of monotonic development" is observed early in training, after which performance plateaus despite continued training
- Further training after the developmental window appears to serve engineering goals of loss reduction rather than increasing cognitive alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that PLMs can acquire human-like cognitive abilities through the training process alone, without explicit programming for these specific abilities. The developmental trajectory follows a pattern where early training leads to monotonic improvement in cognitive tasks, suggesting that the models are learning generalizable cognitive representations. However, after a certain point, additional training primarily optimizes for loss reduction rather than enhancing cognitive alignment, indicating a divergence between engineering objectives and cognitive development patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- Psychometric tasks: Standardized assessments used to measure cognitive abilities; needed to provide objective benchmarks for comparing PLM and human cognitive development; quick check: verify tasks are validated across different populations
- Cognitive domains: Numeric abilities, linguistic abilities, conceptual understanding, and fluid reasoning; needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of human cognitive capabilities; quick check: confirm these domains map to established cognitive psychology frameworks
- Developmental trajectory analysis: Tracking performance changes across training stages; needed to identify patterns of cognitive development in PLMs; quick check: ensure consistent measurement methodology across all training checkpoints

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: PLM training -> Psychometric task evaluation -> Cognitive domain assessment -> Developmental trajectory analysis
Critical path: Training progression → Task performance measurement → Domain-specific analysis → Window identification
Design tradeoffs: Balancing comprehensive cognitive coverage against task specificity; choosing representative rather than exhaustive psychometric tasks
Failure signatures: Performance plateaus despite continued training; misalignment between loss reduction and cognitive ability enhancement
First experiments: 1) Baseline PLM performance on all four cognitive domains 2) Training stage analysis to identify monotonic development window 3) Post-window performance evaluation to assess engineering versus cognitive objectives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study relies on a specific set of psychometric tasks that may not fully capture the complexity of human cognitive development
- The observed developmental window may be influenced by factors specific to the training methodology or model architecture
- The claim that further training serves "engineering goals of loss reduction" rather than cognitive alignment is speculative without direct evidence

## Confidence
- High confidence: Empirical observation that PLMs show improved performance on psychometric tasks during early training phases
- Medium confidence: Characterization of a distinct developmental window with performance plateaus
- Low confidence: Broader claims about implications for understanding human cognitive development and the distinction between cognitive alignment and engineering goals

## Next Checks
1) Replicate the developmental trajectory analysis using alternative psychometric task batteries to verify the robustness of the observed developmental window
2) Conduct ablation studies varying model architecture and training procedures to determine whether the developmental window is an artifact of specific design choices
3) Compare PLM performance on the same psychometric tasks across different stages of human cognitive development to better understand the validity of cross-domain comparisons
