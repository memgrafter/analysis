# VideoWebArena: Evaluating Long Context Multimodal Agents with Video Understanding Web Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.19100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19100
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Long-context multimodal agents achieve only 13.3% success on factual retention tasks compared to human performance of 73.9%

## Executive Summary
VideoWebArena is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate long-context multimodal agents on video understanding web tasks. The benchmark includes 2,021 tasks based on 74 manually created video tutorials totaling nearly four hours of content across six web domains. It tests agents' abilities in both skill retention (using video demonstrations to complete tasks efficiently) and factual retention (retrieving instruction-relevant information from videos). The benchmark evaluates four types of video perception tasks: visual, audio, full video understanding, and temporal reasoning. Experiments with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Phi-3.5V reveal significant performance gaps compared to human baselines, highlighting the need for improved agentic abilities in long-context multimodal models for video understanding.

## Method Summary
The VideoWebArena benchmark evaluates long-context multimodal agents using 2,021 web agent tasks across six domains (Reddit, Classifieds, Shopping, Shopping Admin, Map, GitLab). The benchmark uses 74 manually created video tutorials totaling 3h 48m 19s. Four baseline agents are tested: video in-context, video frames in-context, video summary in-context, and human performance comparison. Tasks are categorized into skill retention (using video demonstrations) and factual retention (retrieving information from videos), with further subdivisions into visual perception, audio perception, full video understanding, and temporal reasoning. Models are evaluated using GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Phi-3.5V with specific prompts for each video input method.

## Key Results
- Models achieve only 13.3% success on factual retention tasks compared to human performance of 73.9%
- On factual retention QA pairs, models score 45.8% versus human performance of 79.3%
- Skill retention tasks show 5-10.3% performance decreases when tutorials are provided, indicating video information introduces negative noise
- Video-capable agents significantly underperform humans across all task categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Video tutorials provide contextual information that should improve task completion efficiency through skill retention
- Mechanism: Models use in-context video demonstrations to learn procedural knowledge and action sequences for completing tasks
- Core assumption: Models can effectively extract and apply procedural knowledge from video demonstrations to web-based tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "skill retention tasks evaluate whether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task efficiently"
  - [section]: "For skill retention, we further divide this category into four finer sub-categories: (1) Visual Perception (OCR, Spatial Reasoning), (2) Audio Perception, (3) Full Video Understanding, and (4) Temporal Reasoning"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found about this specific mechanism working
- Break condition: When video information introduces noise that confuses the model's action generation, causing it to deviate from successful task completion patterns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Video input enables models to answer factual questions about video content through information retrieval
- Mechanism: Models process video frames and audio to extract specific information needed to complete tasks that require factual knowledge from videos
- Core assumption: Models can accurately identify and retrieve relevant information from video content when given specific questions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve instruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task"
  - [section]: "For factual retention, we further divide this category into four finer sub-categories: (1) Visual Perception (OCR, Spatial Reasoning), (2) Audio Perception, (3) Full Video Understanding, and (4) Temporal Reasoning"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found about this mechanism working reliably
- Break condition: When video processing methods (frames, summaries, full video) fail to capture the necessary information for answering specific questions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Long-context models can maintain coherence across extended video sequences for complex reasoning tasks
- Mechanism: Models process multiple video frames over time to understand temporal relationships and causal sequences in videos
- Core assumption: Models can effectively track information across extended time periods in videos for reasoning tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The requirement for agents to operate across varying modalities and time frames makes developing and properly evaluating long-context multimodal models essential"
  - [section]: "However, recent advancements in long-context understanding of large video-capable vision language models... have enabled these agentic models to not only process and understand more information than before, including long video understanding"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence found about this mechanism working reliably
- Break condition: When models lose track of important information across time or fail to maintain coherence in long video sequences

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Video understanding taxonomy (Visual Perception, Audio Perception, Full Video Understanding, Temporal Reasoning)
  - Why needed here: Provides structured framework for categorizing and evaluating different aspects of video comprehension
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between visual perception and full video understanding tasks?

- Concept: Agent action spaces and POMDP formulation
  - Why needed here: Defines how agents interact with web environments and make decisions based on observations
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the POMDP formulation used in this benchmark?

- Concept: Long-context processing in multimodal models
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how models handle extended video sequences and multiple modalities
  - Quick check question: How do different video input methods (frames, summaries, full video) affect model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video processing pipeline (frames extraction, audio transcription, video summarization) -> Multimodal model integration (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Phi-3.5V) -> Web interaction framework (Set-of-Marks observation space, action generation) -> Task evaluation system (automatic evaluators for intent and intermediate intent)

- Critical path: 1. Video input processing → 2. Multimodal model inference → 3. Action generation → 4. Web environment interaction → 5. Task completion evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Video input method: Full video provides complete information but may be computationally expensive; frames provide efficiency but may miss important details; summaries provide abstraction but may lose critical information
  - Model selection: Different models have varying capabilities in video understanding, action grounding, and reasoning
  - Task complexity: Balancing between realistic task difficulty and model capability limitations

- Failure signatures:
  - Action formatting errors (using element names instead of IDs)
  - Multi-action generation when single actions are expected
  - Video grounding failures (missing visual information in processed video input)
  - Repetitive action loops when negative feedback is received

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare model performance across different video input methods (full video vs frames vs summaries) on identical tasks
  2. Test model performance with and without video tutorials on skill retention tasks to measure tutorial effectiveness
  3. Evaluate model performance on different difficulty levels of factual retention tasks to identify capability thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of video tutorials affect the performance of long-context multimodal models on skill retention tasks compared to tasks without tutorials?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that models perform worse with tutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks and a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why tutorials introduce negative noise that hurts action selection, leaving the underlying mechanisms unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments isolating specific types of video content (e.g., irrelevant vs. relevant information) and their impact on model performance would clarify the role of tutorial content in task completion.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific failure modes of long-context multimodal models when processing video information for factual retention tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies common failure modes such as hallucinations, failure to do visual grounding, and action grounding and planning errors.
- Why unresolved: While the paper lists these failure modes, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of their frequency or the conditions under which they occur.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis categorizing failure modes by task type and video content would provide insights into model limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different video processing methods (e.g., video frames vs. video summaries) impact the performance of long-context multimodal models on video understanding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares video frame agents and video summary agents, showing varying performance levels.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the trade-offs between different video processing methods in depth, such as computational efficiency versus accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance and resource usage of different video processing methods on a wider range of tasks would clarify their relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations
- Video processing effectiveness remains unclear as models perform worse with tutorials than without
- Grounding issues persist where agents fail to connect video information with web elements correctly
- Generalization claims are limited as the benchmark focuses on specific tutorial formats and web domains

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Benchmark creation methodology and task categorization framework are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium Confidence: Mechanism by which video tutorials fail to improve performance is documented but underlying reasons require investigation
- Low Confidence: Fundamental mechanism by which multimodal agents should benefit from video context lacks corpus evidence

## Next Checks
1. **Video Input Method Comparison**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing model performance using different video input methods (frames, summaries, full video) on identical tasks to determine which processing approach yields the best results and why certain methods fail.

2. **Tutorial Necessity Analysis**: Systematically test whether removing tutorials improves performance across all task types, and if so, identify which specific aspects of video processing are causing degradation in agent performance.

3. **Grounding Failure Diagnosis**: Create a diagnostic suite that isolates whether performance failures stem from video understanding limitations, web element identification problems, or the integration between video information and web actions, using controlled test cases for each component.
