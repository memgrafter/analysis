# Difficulty Estimation and Simplification of French Text Using LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.18061
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18061
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: LLMs significantly outperform traditional readability metrics for French text difficulty estimation (F1-scores up to 0.90) and fine-tuned models improve text simplification quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of estimating and simplifying French text difficulty for language learners using large language models. The authors frame both tasks as prediction problems, employing fine-tuned models like GPT-3.5 and CamemBERT for difficulty classification and text simplification. Their approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to traditional readability metrics, with F1-scores reaching 0.90 for difficulty estimation. For text simplification, the paper introduces a weighted-score metric that balances simplification accuracy and semantic similarity, with GPT-4 zero-shot achieving the highest w-Score of 0.64. The methodology is language-agnostic and directly applicable to other languages with minimal modification.

## Method Summary
The authors frame difficulty estimation as a classification task using labeled CEFR-level examples, employing transfer learning with pre-trained LLMs like GPT-3.5, CamemBERT, and Mistral-7B. For text simplification, they model it as a sequence-to-sequence task using fine-tuned LLMs trained on sentence pairs of original and simplified text. The evaluation uses F1-scores for difficulty estimation and introduces a weighted-score metric (w-Score) for simplification that combines simplification accuracy (percentage of sentences simplified to exactly one CEFR level lower) and semantic similarity (cosine similarity of sentence embeddings). The approach is validated on French texts across multiple datasets for both tasks.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 achieves F1-scores up to 0.90 for French text difficulty estimation, significantly outperforming traditional readability metrics
- GPT-4 zero-shot achieves the highest w-Score of 0.64 for text simplification, balancing simplification accuracy (50%) and semantic similarity
- Fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot approaches for both difficulty estimation and text simplification tasks
- Smaller models like Mistral-7B and CamemBERT show competitive performance despite having far fewer parameters than GPT-3.5

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning LLMs with limited sentence pairs significantly improves difficulty estimation accuracy compared to zero-shot approaches
- Mechanism: LLMs like GPT-3.5 and CamemBERT already encode rich linguistic knowledge. Fine-tuning adapts this knowledge to the specific task of classifying French text difficulty using CEFR levels, leading to higher F1-scores than traditional readability metrics
- Core assumption: Pre-trained LLM embeddings capture relevant linguistic features (syntax, semantics, vocabulary complexity) that correlate with CEFR difficulty levels
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states superior accuracy compared to previous approaches; Section 4.1 shows GPT-3.5 achieving highest F1-scores; Section 2.2 explains how LLMs convert text tokens into meaning-capturing embeddings
- Break condition: If pre-trained LLM embeddings do not encode linguistic features relevant to CEFR difficulty (e.g., if trained primarily on non-educational or non-French text)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Text simplification using fine-tuned LLMs balances simplification accuracy and semantic similarity, outperforming zero-shot approaches
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning LLMs on sentence pairs teaches the model to reduce linguistic complexity while preserving meaning. The w-Score metric combines simplification accuracy (reducing difficulty by exactly one CEFR level) and semantic similarity (cosine similarity of embeddings) to evaluate performance
- Core assumption: The LLM can learn a mapping from complex to simpler sentences that maintains semantic equivalence, and the CEFR difficulty classification model can accurately assess difficulty of both original and simplified texts
- Evidence anchors: Abstract discusses trade-off between simplification quality and meaning preservation; Section 3.1 models simplification as sequence-to-sequence task; Section 4.2 shows GPT-4 zero-shot achieving highest w-Score
- Break condition: If semantic similarity metric does not accurately capture meaning preservation (e.g., if embeddings are not sensitive to nuanced meaning changes)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The language-agnostic methodology allows the approach to be applied to other languages with minimal modification
- Mechanism: The core components—difficulty estimation as classification, text simplification as sequence-to-sequence task, and evaluation using w-Score—do not depend on language-specific features. By swapping the LLM and CEFR-equivalent labels, the same framework can be used
- Core assumption: Linguistic features that determine text difficulty and the ability to simplify text while preserving meaning are universal across languages
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states methods are language-agnostic and directly applicable to other foreign languages; Section 2.1 notes readability methods have been extended from English to other languages
- Break condition: If a language lacks sufficient labeled data for fine-tuning or if its linguistic structure makes simplification fundamentally different

## Foundational Learning

- **Transfer learning with pre-trained language models**: Why needed here: LLMs like BERT and GPT have already learned rich linguistic representations from massive text corpora. Transfer learning allows leveraging this knowledge for specific tasks with relatively small amounts of task-specific data. Quick check: What is the primary advantage of using a pre-trained LLM for a downstream task like text classification compared to training a model from scratch?

- **Readability metrics and their limitations**: Why needed here: Traditional readability formulas estimate text difficulty based on surface features like sentence length and word frequency. Understanding their limitations motivates the use of ML/LLM approaches. Quick check: Why might traditional readability metrics be less effective for estimating difficulty of texts for second language learners compared to native speakers?

- **Sequence-to-sequence modeling for text generation**: Why needed here: Text simplification is modeled as a sequence-to-sequence task where input is a complex sentence and output is a simplified version. Fine-tuning LLMs for this task allows learning transformation rules. Quick check: In the context of text simplification, what is the role of the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing → Model training → Difficulty estimation/simplification → Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing → Model training → Difficulty estimation/simplification → Evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Model size vs. performance (larger models perform better but are more expensive); Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning (fine-tuning improves performance but requires labeled data); Simplification vs. meaning preservation (aggressive simplification may reduce meaning)
- **Failure signatures**: Low F1-score in difficulty estimation (model not learning relevant features or data not representative); Low w-Score in simplification (model not simplifying enough or losing too much meaning); High variance in w-Score across CEFR levels (uneven performance)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Fine-tune GPT-3.5 on the sentencesInternet dataset and evaluate difficulty estimation F1-score on the test set
  2. Fine-tune Mistral-7B on the training-set (original-simplified sentence pairs) and evaluate text simplification w-Score on the test-set
  3. Compare performance of zero-shot GPT-4 vs. fine-tuned GPT-3.5 on both difficulty estimation and text simplification tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How would the performance of difficulty estimation models change when evaluated on entire paragraphs rather than isolated sentences?
2. What is the optimal trade-off between simplification accuracy and semantic preservation across different CEFR levels?
3. How would including larger open-source models like Mistral 8x22B affect the performance comparison between zero-shot and fine-tuned approaches?

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic training data for text simplification generated using GPT-4 may introduce biases
- Semantic similarity metric (cosine similarity of embeddings) may not fully capture meaning preservation
- Language-agnostic claims not empirically validated beyond French, potentially limiting generalization to other languages

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Difficulty estimation results using fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5, achieving F1-scores up to 0.90
- **Medium Confidence**: Text simplification results, particularly the w-Score metric and comparison between zero-shot and fine-tuned approaches
- **Low Confidence**: Language-agnostic claims and potential for applying this approach to other languages without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate on real simplification data instead of synthetic training data to assess performance on authentic examples
2. Apply methodology to at least two additional languages (e.g., Spanish and German) to empirically test language-agnostic claims
3. Experiment with multiple semantic similarity metrics (e.g., BERTScore, BLEURT) and conduct human evaluations to validate the reliability of cosine similarity approach
