# Towards Cross-Lingual Audio Abuse Detection in Low-Resource Settings with Few-Shot Learning

## Quick Facts

- This study demonstrates Whisper with L2-norm normalization achieves up to 85.22% accuracy in cross-lingual audio abuse detection across 10 Indian languages using few-shot learning

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the underexplored challenge of audio abuse detection in low-resource Indian languages by leveraging few-shot learning and pre-trained audio representations. The research proposes a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework that utilizes embeddings from Whisper and Wav2Vec, normalized via L2-norm and temporal mean methods, to classify abusive content across 10 Indian languages using the ADIMA dataset. Experiments with shot sizes ranging from 50 to 200 samples per language demonstrate that Whisper with L2-norm normalization achieves the highest accuracy (up to 85.22%) and macro-F1 scores, outperforming baseline approaches. Visual analysis reveals language-specific clustering patterns, with Dravidian languages (Tamil, Malayalam) showing tighter groupings, indicating effective cross-lingual generalization. The study underscores the potential of pre-trained audio models in low-resource settings and highlights strategies for scalable, multilingual audio abuse detection.

## Method Summary
The study employs a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework for cross-lingual audio abuse detection in low-resource settings. The approach uses pre-trained audio models (Whisper and Wav2Vec) to generate embeddings, which are then normalized using either L2-norm or temporal mean methods. These normalized embeddings serve as input to the MAML model, which learns to classify abusive content across 10 Indian languages. The framework is evaluated using the ADIMA dataset with shot sizes ranging from 50 to 200 samples per language, testing the model's ability to generalize across languages with limited training data.

## Key Results
- Whisper with L2-norm normalization achieves highest accuracy of 85.22% in cross-lingual audio abuse detection
- Macro-F1 scores demonstrate superior performance of Whisper-based approach over Wav2Vec
- Dravidian languages (Tamil, Malayalam) show tighter clustering patterns in visual analysis, indicating effective cross-lingual generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of this approach stems from leveraging pre-trained audio models that capture rich linguistic features, combined with meta-learning's ability to adapt quickly to new languages with limited data. The normalization techniques help standardize the feature space across languages, while MAML's episodic training enables the model to learn transferable knowledge that generalizes across language boundaries.

## Foundational Learning
- Few-shot learning: Enables model training with minimal examples per class, critical for low-resource language scenarios
- Meta-learning (MAML): Provides framework for learning how to learn, allowing rapid adaptation to new languages
- Pre-trained audio embeddings: Captures linguistic patterns from large-scale training, transferring knowledge to low-resource languages
- Cross-lingual generalization: Demonstrates model's ability to transfer knowledge across language boundaries
- Audio abuse detection: Specialized task requiring understanding of abusive content patterns in spoken language

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Pre-trained audio models (Whisper/Wav2Vec) -> Normalization (L2-norm/Temporal mean) -> MAML framework -> Classification output

Critical path: Audio input → Embedding extraction → Normalization → MAML training → Cross-lingual classification

Design tradeoffs: Whisper vs Wav2Vec trade-off between performance and computational efficiency; L2-norm vs temporal mean normalization balance between standardization and preserving temporal information

Failure signatures: Poor performance on non-Dravidian languages; sensitivity to shot size variations; potential overfitting with larger shot sizes

First experiments:
1. Baseline comparison without normalization
2. Ablation study comparing Whisper vs Wav2Vec alone
3. Shot size sensitivity analysis from 10 to 200 samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on single dataset (ADIMA) with limited details about composition and potential biases
- Shot size range (50-200) may not fully capture true low-resource setting with fewer examples
- Focus exclusively on Indian languages limits generalizability to other language families

## Confidence
High: Pre-trained model embeddings' effectiveness (supported by clear performance differentials)
High: Few-shot learning methodology (established MAML framework with thorough ablation studies)
Medium: Cross-lingual generalization claims (strong performance but constrained by dataset limitations)

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on languages from different families to assess true cross-lingual capability
2. Conduct experiments with shot sizes below 50 to better validate low-resource claims
3. Implement rigorous class balance evaluation and stratified sampling to ensure robust performance metrics across all abuse categories
