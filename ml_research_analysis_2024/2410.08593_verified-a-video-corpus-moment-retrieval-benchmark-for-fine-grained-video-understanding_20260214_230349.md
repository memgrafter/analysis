# VERIFIED: A Video Corpus Moment Retrieval Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08593
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08593
- Reference count: 40
- VERIFIED pipeline creates fine-grained VCMR benchmarks that reduce many-to-many pairs and improve model performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VERIFIED, an automatic video-text annotation pipeline that generates fine-grained VCMR benchmarks. Existing VCMR datasets suffer from coarse-grained annotations that make precise moment localization difficult due to partially matched candidates. VERIFIED addresses this by leveraging LLMs and LMMs with specialized captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions, then filtering inaccurate annotations using a noise evaluator. The pipeline constructs three fine-grained benchmarks (Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, ActivityNet-FIG) and demonstrates significant improvements in model performance when trained on these datasets.

## Method Summary
VERIFIED processes existing VCMR datasets through a pipeline combining LLM and LMM models for statics and dynamics enhanced captioning, followed by quality filtering using a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator. The method extracts keyframes from video moments, generates static captions focusing on attributes and background using image LMM, and creates dynamic captions emphasizing motion and interactions through VQA-guided approaches. These captions are evaluated and filtered for accuracy before constructing fine-grained benchmarks. The pipeline is tested on Charades-STA, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions datasets to create Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG respectively.

## Key Results
- VERIFIED generates fine-grained captions with diverse static and dynamic details for each video moment
- The Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator successfully filters out inaccurate annotations from LLM hallucinations
- State-of-the-art VCMR models show improved performance on fine-grained benchmarks compared to original datasets
- The benchmarks significantly reduce many-to-many pairs in training data, providing more precise ground truth annotations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VERIFIED's fine-grained annotations improve model performance by reducing the number of many-to-many pairs in training data
- Mechanism: The pipeline generates multiple diverse captions for each video moment, with each caption capturing different static or dynamic details. This creates more precise ground truth annotations that are easier for models to learn from
- Core assumption: Reducing many-to-many pairs in training data leads to better model performance on fine-grained VCMR tasks
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "Compared to previous ones, our benchmark significantly reduces the many-to-many situations, offering more precise ground truth annotations"
- Break condition: If the model still struggles to distinguish between partially matched candidates despite the reduced many-to-many pairs

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator effectively filters out inaccurate annotations generated by LLMs
- Mechanism: The evaluator is fine-tuned with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses, allowing it to better discriminate between reasonable and unreasonable annotations
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives improves its ability to detect annotation inaccuracies
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses"
- Break condition: If the evaluator fails to assign lower confidence scores to captions with inaccurate content

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules captures more fine-grained information than existing video annotation methods
- Mechanism: The statics module extracts foreground and background attributes using image LMM, while the dynamics module uses VQA-guided dynamic detail discovering to focus on motion and interactions
- Core assumption: Image LMM and VQA-guided approaches are effective at extracting static and dynamic details respectively
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video"
- Break condition: If the generated captions fail to capture more fine-grained information than previous coarse-grained annotations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)
  - Why needed here: These models are used to generate diverse fine-grained captions and extract static and dynamic details from videos
  - Quick check question: How do LLMs and LMMs differ in their ability to process text-only versus multimodal inputs?

- Concept: Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR)
  - Why needed here: The proposed benchmark aims to improve VCMR by introducing more challenging fine-grained queries and annotations
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between VCMR and Single Video Moment Retrieval (SVMR)?

- Concept: Contrastive Learning
  - Why needed here: Used in the Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator to discriminate between reasonable and unreasonable annotations
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning help in improving the quality of video-text annotations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video corpus with coarse annotations -> Statics Enhanced Captioning module -> Dynamics Enhanced Captioning module -> Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator -> Fine-grained VCMR benchmarks

- Critical path:
  1. Extract key frames from video moments
  2. Generate static and dynamic captions using LMMs and LLMs
  3. Evaluate and filter captions using the Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator
  4. Construct fine-grained VCMR benchmarks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using multiple models (LLMs, LMMs) increases complexity but improves annotation quality
  - Generating multiple captions per video moment increases dataset size but provides more diverse training data
  - Fine-tuning the evaluator requires additional computational resources but improves annotation accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - Low confidence scores for most generated captions
  - Poor performance of VCMR models trained on the fine-grained benchmarks
  - Many-to-many pairs still present in the final annotations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator on a small set of manually annotated videos to assess its accuracy in detecting annotation inaccuracies
  2. Compare the performance of VCMR models trained on fine-grained vs. coarse-grained annotations using a subset of the benchmark datasets
  3. Analyze the distribution of confidence scores assigned by the evaluator to understand its ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate captions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a completely end-to-end captioning model to replace the current pipeline that combines multiple existing models for fine-grained video annotation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention in the conclusion that a future goal is to train a completely end-to-end captioning model to complete the fine-grained annotations with the capabilities of the complicated pipeline that combines many powerful existing models
- Why unresolved: Current fine-grained video annotation relies on a pipeline of multiple specialized models (LLM, LMM, VQA, evaluator), creating complexity and potential integration issues. An end-to-end approach would be more efficient but faces challenges in training data requirements and model architecture design
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a unified end-to-end model that achieves comparable or better performance than the current VERIFIED pipeline on fine-grained VCMR benchmarks, with demonstrated improvements in annotation efficiency and quality

### Open Question 2
- Question: What methods can be developed to reduce the gap between the captioning modules' real hallucinations and the perturbation approximation used in the Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in the conclusion that "the gap between the captioning modules' real hallucinations and our perturbation approximation does exist and it would require more analysis to reduce this gap"
- Why unresolved: The current noise evaluator relies on artificially disturbed negative samples, which may not perfectly represent the actual hallucinations that occur in LLM/LMM outputs. This approximation could limit the evaluator's effectiveness in filtering inaccurate annotations
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of improved hallucination detection methods that better capture real LLM/LMM hallucinations, validated through comparison with human judgments and demonstrated improvements in annotation quality

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can video-level and moment-level learning be better disentangled during training to improve fine-grained VCMR performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that "incorporating finer-grained information during video-level retrieval learning may interfere with precise moment localization, compromising performance" and recommend avoiding this entanglement
- Why unresolved: Current models like SQuiDNet that attempt to combine video-level and moment-level learning show unstable performance in VCMR tasks. The optimal training strategy for balancing these two levels of learning remains unclear
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of training methodologies that successfully separate video-level and moment-level learning objectives, validated through improved performance on fine-grained VCMR benchmarks compared to current approaches

## Limitations
- The pipeline relies heavily on LLM and LMM capabilities, which may vary across different model versions and could introduce inconsistencies in annotation quality
- The noise evaluation component depends on the quality of disturbed hard-negative samples for fine-tuning, and insufficient diversity in these samples could limit the evaluator's effectiveness
- Evidence supporting claims about improved model performance is primarily internal to the VERIFIED pipeline, lacking external validation using independent video datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence: The pipeline's ability to generate diverse captions using LLM and LMM combinations
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator in filtering inaccurate annotations
- Medium confidence: The claim that fine-grained annotations reduce many-to-many pairs in training data

## Next Checks
1. Test the Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator on a manually annotated validation set with known annotation errors to verify its accuracy in detecting inaccuracies
2. Conduct ablation studies removing either the statics or dynamics enhanced captioning components to quantify their individual contributions to annotation quality
3. Evaluate the trained VCMR models on additional fine-grained video datasets not used in the VERIFIED pipeline to assess generalization capability
