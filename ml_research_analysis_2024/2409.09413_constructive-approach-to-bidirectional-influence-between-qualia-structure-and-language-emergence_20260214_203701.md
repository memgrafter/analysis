core_contribution: This paper introduces a constructive approach to study the bidirectional
  influence between language emergence and the structure of subjective experiences,
  called qualia structure. The authors propose that language emergence, driven by
  the alignment of internal representations across individuals, may in turn facilitate
  more structured language.

# Constructive Approach to Bidirectional Influence between Qualia Structure and Language Emergence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.09413
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09413
- Reference count: 9
- This paper proposes a novel perspective on bidirectional causation between language emergence and qualia structure formation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a constructive approach to study the bidirectional influence between language emergence and the structure of subjective experiences (qualia). The authors propose that language emergence, driven by the alignment of internal representations across individuals, may in turn facilitate more structured language. This mutual dependency is explored through computational studies involving neural network-based language models and multimodal language models. The findings suggest that language emergence not only serves as a communication tool but also as a mechanism for shared understanding of qualitative experiences.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a constructive approach using neural network models with learning mechanisms like collective predictive coding. The method involves training neural network models, extracting their internal representations, and comparing these with human qualia structures estimated from behavioral experiments. Representational similarity analysis and unsupervised alignment methods are used to assess structural similarities and differences between model representations and human behavioral data.

## Key Results
- Language emergence serves as both a communication tool and a mechanism for shared understanding of qualitative experiences
- Neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations
- Multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Neural network-based language models form structured internal representations that reflect the structure of the world through representation learning. The relational structure of neural activity correlates with the relational structure of qualia.

### Mechanism 2
Language acts as an aligning force for subjective experiences by imposing structure on internal representations formed through sensory-motor integration and linguistic knowledge incorporation. Sharing language leads to structurally similar qualia structures across individuals.

### Mechanism 3
Bidirectional causation between language emergence and qualia structure formation can be studied through constructive approaches involving neural network models and representational similarity analysis. Train neural network models with collective predictive coding, extract internal representations, and compare with human qualia structures using unsupervised alignment methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Symbol Emergence Systems
  - Why needed here: Describes how language emerges through bidirectional causation between internal representations and the external world
  - Quick check question: What is the key characteristic of symbol emergence systems that distinguishes them from traditional symbolic AI approaches?

- Concept: Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)
  - Why needed here: Standard method for comparing different representational structures
  - Quick check question: How does RSA compare representational structures, and what does a high correlation indicate?

- Concept: Collective Predictive Coding (CPC)
  - Why needed here: Formalizes symbol emergence as decentralized Bayesian inference
  - Quick check question: How does CPC relate to the free-energy principle and world models in symbol emergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Neural network models -> Representational similarity analysis tools -> Behavioral datasets -> Unsupervised alignment methods
- Critical path: Train neural network models with learning mechanisms → Extract internal representations → Compare with human qualia structures using RSA and unsupervised alignment → Analyze structural similarities and differences
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing model complexity with interpretability, choosing appropriate learning mechanisms, selecting representative behavioral datasets, determining abstraction level for qualia analysis
- Failure signatures: Lack of structural correspondence between model representations and human qualia structures, poor performance of unsupervised alignment methods, inability to capture bidirectional nature
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a neural network-based language model on a large text corpus and analyze the structure of its internal representations using RSA
  2. Train a multimodal language model (e.g., vision-language model) and compare its representations of 93 colors with those of color-neurotypical humans using unsupervised alignment methods
  3. Implement a generative model of emergent communication (e.g., Inter-GMM+VAE) and examine how word-level naming shared through naming games influences the structure of internal representations and improves performance on perceptual stimulus modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the precise computational mechanisms by which language emergence leads to structural alignment of qualia representations between individuals? This remains unresolved as the paper acknowledges this as an open question requiring further computational studies.

### Open Question 2
How does the structure of language influence the structure of qualia at different levels of abstraction? The paper introduces a hierarchy of qualia levels but does not detail the specific mechanisms of this influence.

### Open Question 3
What role do interoceptive sensations play in the bidirectional causation between language emergence and qualia structure formation? The paper briefly mentions their importance but does not explore this in detail.

## Limitations
- Claims about bidirectional causation remain largely theoretical with limited empirical validation
- Evidence anchors rely heavily on abstract reasoning rather than concrete experimental results
- Corpus analysis shows weak direct support for proposed mechanisms

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework's relevance to consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science
- Medium confidence in proposed mechanisms given abstract nature of evidence
- Low confidence in specific implementation details of constructive approach

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the collective predictive coding hypothesis in neural network models to assess its effectiveness in capturing bidirectional influence
2. Conduct comprehensive representational similarity analysis comparing model representations with multiple human behavioral datasets to quantify structural alignment
3. Design and execute controlled experiments testing the hypothesis that language emergence facilitates more structured qualia representations through shared understanding
