# DefSent+: Improving sentence embeddings of language models by projecting definition sentences into a quasi-isotropic or isotropic vector space of unlimited dictionary entries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16153
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16153
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity tasks among approaches without using manually labeled datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents DefSent+, a novel approach to improve sentence embeddings by projecting definition sentences into a quasi-isotropic or isotropic vector space of unlimited dictionary entries. The method addresses limitations in the previous DefSent approach, which used word embeddings of language models to represent dictionary entries, leading to constrained entry numbers and correlated semantic axes. DefSent+ introduces Progressive Separate Training (PST) to progressively build entry embeddings, turning an anisotropic vector space into a quasi-isotropic one, resulting in significantly improved sentence embeddings.

## Method Summary
DefSent+ improves upon the previous DefSent approach by introducing a novel method called Progressive Separate Training (PST). This method allows for the progressive construction of entry embeddings, effectively converting an anisotropic vector space into a quasi-isotropic one. The core innovation lies in the ability to project definition sentences into a more directionally uniform vector space, which significantly enhances the quality of sentence embeddings. The approach is designed to work with unlimited dictionary entries, addressing a key limitation of the original DefSent method.

## Key Results
- DefSent+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity tasks among approaches that do not use manually labeled datasets.
- When applied to further train data-augmented models like SIMCSE, SNCSE, and SynCSE, DefSent+ leads to even better performance.
- DefSent+ demonstrates competitive capability in feature-based transfer for NLP downstream tasks, addressing a weakness in the previous DefSent approach.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind DefSent+ involves transforming an anisotropic vector space into a quasi-isotropic one through Progressive Separate Training (PST). This transformation allows definition sentences to be projected into a more directionally uniform space, which improves the quality of sentence embeddings. By addressing the issue of correlated semantic axes present in the original DefSent approach, DefSent+ can effectively handle unlimited dictionary entries, leading to more robust and accurate sentence representations.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Anisotropic vs. Isotropic Vector Spaces**
   - Why needed: Understanding the difference between these vector spaces is crucial for grasping how DefSent+ improves sentence embeddings.
   - Quick check: Can you explain how the uniformity of vector directions differs between anisotropic and isotropic spaces?

2. **Sentence Embedding Techniques**
   - Why needed: Familiarity with various sentence embedding methods helps contextualize DefSent+ within the broader field of natural language processing.
   - Quick check: What are some other popular methods for generating sentence embeddings, and how do they differ from DefSent+?

3. **Semantic Textual Similarity Tasks**
   - Why needed: These tasks are a primary benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of sentence embedding methods like DefSent+.
   - Quick check: What are some common datasets used for semantic textual similarity evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Language Model -> Dictionary Entries -> Progressive Separate Training (PST) -> Quasi-isotropic Vector Space -> Improved Sentence Embeddings

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the transformation of dictionary entries through PST into a quasi-isotropic vector space, which then enables the projection of definition sentences into this improved space for enhanced sentence embeddings.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Scalability vs. Quality: Allowing unlimited dictionary entries may increase computational costs but improves the quality and robustness of sentence embeddings.
- Complexity vs. Performance: The PST method adds complexity to the model but significantly enhances performance on semantic textual similarity tasks.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degraded performance on downstream NLP tasks when the vector space fails to maintain quasi-isotropy.
- Increased computational costs that may not justify the marginal improvements in sentence embedding quality for certain applications.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate DefSent+ on a diverse set of semantic textual similarity datasets to confirm its state-of-the-art performance claims.
2. Compare the computational efficiency of DefSent+ with the original DefSent approach when handling large dictionary entries.
3. Test the robustness of DefSent+ by applying it to various pre-trained language models and assessing the consistency of improvements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
