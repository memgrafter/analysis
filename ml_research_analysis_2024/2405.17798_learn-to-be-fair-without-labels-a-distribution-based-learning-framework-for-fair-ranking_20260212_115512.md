# Learn to be Fair without Labels: a Distribution-based Learning Framework for Fair Ranking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.17798
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17798
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Distribution-based fair learning framework achieves statistically significant improvements in fairness metrics while maintaining relevance performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a distribution-based fair learning framework (DLF) that addresses the critical challenge of fair ranking without requiring fairness labels. The framework replaces unavailable fairness labels with target fairness exposure distributions, enabling training through gradient descent. By leveraging contextual features extracted from full-text fields and separating fairness and relevance models, DLF achieves superior performance compared to existing fair ranking frameworks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in fairness metrics while maintaining relevance performance on the TREC fair ranking track dataset.

## Method Summary
DLF is a distribution-based learning framework that trains fair ranking models without fairness labels by using target fairness exposure distributions. The method involves extracting contextual features from full-text fields using Sentence-BERT, training separate fairness and relevance models, and merging them with a weighted sum function. The framework uses Kullback-Leibler divergence between system-produced and target exposure distributions as the loss function, enabling gradient descent training without explicit fairness labels. The approach separates fairness and relevance optimization, allowing better control over the fairness-relevance trade-off through parameter tuning.

## Key Results
- DLF achieves statistically significant improvements in fairness metrics (AWRF@20) compared to existing fair ranking frameworks
- The framework maintains relevance performance (nDCG@20) while improving fairness outcomes
- DLF demonstrates better convergence behavior and lower loss compared to frameworks using only numerical features
- The approach provides better interpretability and manageability of the fairness-relevance trade-off through separate model training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distribution-based learning without fairness labels
Replacing unavailable fairness labels with target fairness exposure distributions enables effective gradient descent training. The loss function uses KL divergence between system-produced and target exposure distributions, eliminating the need for explicit fairness labels while maintaining differentiability. This works because target exposure distributions can be estimated from relevance data to accurately reflect fairness goals.

### Mechanism 2: Separate fairness and relevance models
Separating fairness and relevance models enables better control over the fairness-relevance trade-off. The framework trains models separately on tailored feature sets and merges them using a weighted sum function with parameter α. This approach assumes that features good for fairness prediction differ from those good for relevance prediction, and separate training provides better trade-off management than joint optimization.

### Mechanism 3: Contextual features from full-text fields
Contextual features extracted from full-text fields improve model performance and interpretability. The framework uses Sentence-BERT embeddings and similarity features between query/document and fairness-related embeddings to capture semantic relationships. This works because semantic relationships between text content and fairness categories contain predictive signal that numerical features alone cannot represent.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kullback-Leibler divergence**: Used as distance measure between probability distributions in the fairness-aware loss function. Why needed: Enables comparison of exposure distributions in ranking. Quick check: What property of KL divergence makes it suitable for comparing exposure distributions?

- **Top-one probability extension**: The framework uses "top one fair probability" reflecting probability of a document being ranked at top position based on fairness contribution. Why needed: Enables fairness-aware ranking optimization. Quick check: How does top-one fair probability differ from standard top-one probability in learning-to-rank?

- **Gradient descent optimization**: The framework trains the model using gradient descent requiring differentiable loss functions. Why needed: Enables model training without fairness labels. Quick check: Why can't position-aware decay functions used in evaluation be directly used in the learning loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: BM25 retrieval → DLF fairness model (with contextual features) → Weighted sum merge with relevance model → Final ranking
- **Critical path**: DLF model training is critical - must converge effectively using distribution-based loss before merging with relevance
- **Design tradeoffs**: Separate training allows better trade-off control but requires careful feature engineering for both models; joint training might be simpler but harder to tune
- **Failure signatures**: Poor fairness performance indicates issues with target distribution estimation or contextual feature extraction; poor relevance indicates issues with merge weight or relevance model quality
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train DLF with and without contextual features to verify value proposition
  2. Test different values of α to observe fairness-relevance trade-off curve
  3. Compare DLF's convergence behavior against DELTR on same dataset to validate label-free approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Optimal strategy for selecting category weights**: The paper does not explore how different weightings of fairness categories affect overall fairness performance, leaving the optimal strategy unclear. Evidence needed: Experimental study varying weights for different fairness categories and measuring impact on overall fairness metrics.

- **Impact of contextual features on fairness performance**: While the paper claims improved performance with contextual features, it lacks quantitative comparison showing exact contribution to fairness metrics. Evidence needed: Ablation study comparing DLF's performance with and without contextual features, with statistical significance testing.

- **Performance across different dataset characteristics**: The experiments are conducted on a single Wikipedia dataset, raising questions about generalizability to datasets with varying sizes, query distributions, or fairness categories. Evidence needed: Testing DLF framework on multiple datasets with varying characteristics to demonstrate generalizability and robustness.

## Limitations

- Critical implementation details remain unspecified, including exact neural network architecture, hyperparameters, and precise methods for computing target exposure distributions
- Evaluation relies on limited dataset of 50 training and 50 test queries, which may not represent real-world deployment scenarios
- Framework's performance across different fairness categories and generalization to other domains remains unclear

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The conceptual framework of using distribution-based learning without fairness labels is sound and addresses a genuine gap in the literature
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results showing improved AWRF@20 performance are reliable given controlled setup, though broader generalization is uncertain
- **Low Confidence**: Long-term stability and effectiveness across diverse datasets and fairness categories has not been established

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Feature Sets**: Systematically evaluate DLF performance with different combinations of numerical, contextual, and fairness-specific features to quantify contribution of each feature type

2. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test framework on at least two additional fair ranking datasets (e.g., from different domains like academic search or product recommendation) to assess generalizability

3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate model performance when target exposure distributions are estimated with varying degrees of accuracy to understand sensitivity to distribution estimation errors
