# Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimisation in Autonomous Systems
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.01188
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01188
- Reference count: 21
- DWN outperforms DQN by 4.75% and ϵ-greedy by 6.43% in average response time

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Deep W-Learning (DWN) for multi-objective optimization in autonomous systems, specifically applied to the Emergent Web Server (EWS) self-adaptive system. The algorithm integrates W-learning with neural networks to optimize server configurations across two competing objectives: average response time and cost. DWN demonstrates superior performance in minimizing response time compared to single-objective approaches, representing the first real-world application of this technique to autonomous systems. The study highlights DWN's ability to maintain multiple near-optimal configurations rather than converging to a single solution.

## Method Summary
The research applies Deep W-Learning (DWN) to optimize the Emergent Web Server's configuration by simultaneously minimizing average response time and cost. DWN combines W-learning's multi-objective capabilities with deep neural networks to learn optimal configuration policies. The approach is compared against traditional single-objective methods using aggregated reward functions, specifically ϵ-greedy and Deep Q-Network (DQN) approaches. Performance is evaluated using EWS's benchmark dataset, measuring improvements in response time and cost efficiency.

## Key Results
- DWN achieves lowest average response time, outperforming DQN by 4.75% and ϵ-greedy by 6.43%
- DWN maintains multiple near-optimal configurations, demonstrating greater flexibility than competing approaches
- DWN shows slightly higher cost variance compared to single-objective methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DWN's effectiveness stems from its ability to balance multiple competing objectives without requiring predefined weight aggregations. By maintaining multiple near-optimal configurations rather than converging to a single solution, the algorithm can adapt to varying system conditions while optimizing for response time. The integration of W-learning with neural networks enables the system to learn complex, non-linear relationships between server configurations and performance metrics, allowing for more nuanced decision-making in dynamic environments.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multi-objective optimization** - Needed to handle competing system objectives (response time vs cost); Quick check: Can the algorithm maintain Pareto-optimal solutions?
2. **W-learning fundamentals** - Needed for conflict resolution between multiple learning agents; Quick check: Does the algorithm properly weight competing objectives?
3. **Neural network integration** - Needed to approximate complex value functions in high-dimensional state spaces; Quick check: Is the neural network architecture appropriate for the problem domain?
4. **Self-adaptive systems** - Needed to understand the target application domain; Quick check: Does the system properly detect and respond to environmental changes?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** DWN neural network -> W-learning module -> Server configuration controller -> EWS environment
**Critical path:** State observation → Neural network → W-learning arbitration → Configuration selection → Environment response
**Design tradeoffs:** 
- Flexibility vs convergence speed (multiple configurations vs single optimal)
- Response time optimization vs cost efficiency
- Model complexity vs real-time performance
**Failure signatures:** 
- High variance in cost performance
- Suboptimal response times under specific load conditions
- Difficulty scaling to additional objectives
**First experiments:** 
1. Benchmark response time improvements against baseline methods
2. Analyze cost-performance trade-offs under varying load conditions
3. Evaluate configuration diversity maintenance over time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to single case study (EWS), reducing generalizability
- Higher cost variance compared to baseline methods
- No exploration of algorithm performance under different traffic patterns

## Confidence
- Response time improvements: High
- Cost variance findings: Medium
- Generalizability to other autonomous systems: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DWN across multiple autonomous system domains (e.g., robotics, traffic management, smart grids) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct stress testing under varying load conditions and traffic patterns to understand performance bounds
3. Implement cost-aware variants of DWN to investigate whether the cost-performance trade-off can be optimized without sacrificing response time gains
