# SportQA: A Benchmark for Sports Understanding in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.15862
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15862
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: SportQA benchmark evaluates LLMs on sports understanding across 70,000+ questions in three difficulty levels, revealing GPT-4 outperforms other models but lags behind human expertise in complex scenario-based reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SportQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models on sports understanding. The dataset consists of over 70,000 multiple-choice questions across three difficulty levels, ranging from basic historical facts to complex, scenario-based reasoning tasks. The authors evaluated several popular LLMs using few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought prompting. Results show that while LLMs exhibit competent performance in basic sports knowledge, they struggle with more complex, scenario-based sports reasoning, lagging behind human expertise. GPT-4 consistently outperformed other models across all levels, but its performance in Level-3 (the most challenging level) was about 45% inferior to human experts.

## Method Summary
The authors created SportQA with over 70,000 multiple-choice questions across three difficulty levels targeting different aspects of sports knowledge. They evaluated prevalent LLMs using few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought prompting. The benchmark covers various sports domains including soccer, basketball, tennis, and baseball. Performance was measured using accuracy across all tasks, with particular focus on how models handle multi-hop reasoning and scenario-based analysis.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieved average accuracy of 82.16% in Level-1, 75% in Level-2, and 47.14% in Level-3
- GPT-4 consistently outperformed other models across all difficulty levels
- Human experts exceeded GPT-4 performance by roughly 30-65% in different tasks of level-3
- All models struggled significantly with complex, scenario-based reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- GPT-4 outperforms other models across all levels due to its superior ability to perform multi-step reasoning and leverage contextual understanding in sports scenarios
- Core assumption: GPT-4's architecture and training data provide it with a more robust understanding of complex relationships and contextual information in sports
- Evidence anchors: GPT-4 consistently outperformed other models across all levels with accuracy of 82.16% in Level-1, 75% in Level-2, and 47.14% in level-3

### Mechanism 2
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting significantly improves model performance by encouraging explicit reasoning steps in complex sports scenarios
- Core assumption: The explicit reasoning steps provided by CoT prompting help the model navigate complex relationships and contextual information in sports scenarios
- Evidence anchors: The authors utilized few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for model evaluation

### Mechanism 3
- The multi-level difficulty structure of SportQA effectively captures different aspects of sports understanding, from factual recall to complex scenario analysis
- Core assumption: The progressive difficulty levels in SportQA accurately reflect the complexity of sports understanding
- Evidence anchors: SportQA encompasses over 70,000 multiple-choice questions across three distinct difficulty levels, each targeting different aspects of sports knowledge

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: CoT prompting is crucial for guiding models through complex reasoning tasks in sports scenarios, which often require multiple steps of analysis
  - Quick check question: How does CoT prompting differ from standard prompting, and why is it particularly useful for evaluating sports understanding in LLMs?

- Concept: Multi-hop reasoning
  - Why needed here: Sports scenarios often involve multiple interconnected pieces of information, requiring models to reason across different knowledge points to arrive at correct answers
  - Quick check question: Can you provide an example of a sports question that requires multi-hop reasoning and explain why it's challenging for LLMs?

- Concept: Benchmark design and evaluation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to design effective benchmarks like SportQA is crucial for accurately assessing LLM performance in specialized domains like sports
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when designing a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in a specific domain, and how does SportQA address these considerations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question generation -> Question categorization -> Model evaluation -> Performance analysis -> Error analysis
- Critical path: 1. Question creation and categorization 2. Model evaluation using few-shot CoT prompting 3. Performance analysis and error categorization 4. Insights generation and future work identification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth vs. breadth: Focusing on a smaller number of sports in greater detail vs. covering a wider range of sports with less depth
  - Automated vs. manual question generation: Balancing efficiency with the need for expert-level questions in complex scenarios
  - Open-ended vs. multiple-choice format: Allowing for more nuanced responses vs. easier evaluation and comparison
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on scenario-based questions despite good performance on factual recall, inability to correctly answer questions requiring multi-hop reasoning, consistent errors in specific sports or types of questions
- First 3 experiments: 1. Evaluate model performance on each difficulty level separately 2. Compare performance using different prompting strategies 3. Analyze error patterns across different types of questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would expanding SportQA to include sports medicine and psychology domains affect LLM performance?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge that SportQA currently focuses predominantly on rules and gameplay, lacking coverage of sports medicine and psychology
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states that integrating these domains is complex and demanding due to the need for specialized medical and psychological knowledge
- What evidence would resolve it: Creating and evaluating a new version of SportQA that includes sports medicine and psychology questions, then comparing LLM performance on this expanded dataset versus the original version

### Open Question 2
- Question: What performance improvements would be observed if LLMs were evaluated on SportQA using the open-source Llama2-70b-chat model?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that budgetary constraints prevented evaluation of the Llama2-70b-chat model
- Why unresolved: The authors were unable to evaluate this high-capacity model due to budget limitations
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with the Llama2-70b-chat model on all levels of SportQA and comparing its performance to the smaller models that were evaluated

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance gap between human experts and LLMs vary across different sports disciplines in SportQA?
- Basis in paper: The authors report that human expertise exceeds GPT-4 by roughly 30-65% in different tasks of level-3
- Why unresolved: While the authors mention human experts were involved in answering level-3 questions, they do not provide detailed performance comparisons for each individual sport
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing and reporting the accuracy gap between human experts and each LLM model separately for each sport discipline covered in SportQA

## Limitations

- The specific methodology for creating SportQA questions and ensuring their quality remains unclear
- The relatively small number of Level-3 questions (3,522) compared to other levels may limit the robustness of conclusions about complex sports reasoning capabilities
- The reliance on multiple-choice format may not fully represent the complexity of real-world sports understanding tasks

## Confidence

- Overall benchmark design: Medium
- Comparative performance results between models: High
- Claims about GPT-4 outperforming other models: High
- Claims about 45% performance gap between GPT-4 and human experts in Level-3: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an independent review of a stratified sample of questions across all difficulty levels to verify the accuracy, relevance, and appropriate categorization of sports questions

2. Systematically test alternative prompting strategies (zero-shot, different CoT variants, different few-shot examples) to determine if the reported performance differences between models are robust to prompting variations

3. Test the models' performance on sports questions from domains not represented in the training data to assess whether the benchmark captures genuine sports understanding or domain-specific memorization
