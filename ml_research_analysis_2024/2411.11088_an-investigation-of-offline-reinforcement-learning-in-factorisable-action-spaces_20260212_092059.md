# An Investigation of Offline Reinforcement Learning in Factorisable Action Spaces

## Quick Facts

- This paper investigates offline reinforcement learning in factorisable action spaces, showing that factorised approaches outperform atomic action representations and achieve expert-level policies with sufficient high-quality data.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates offline reinforcement learning in factorisable action spaces by adapting DecQN (a value-decomposition method) to the offline setting. The authors introduce a new benchmark suite comprising environments with factorisable actions and datasets of varying quality. Through experiments on maze navigation and DeepMind Control Suite tasks, they demonstrate that their factorised approaches outperform atomic action representations, achieve expert-level policies when sufficient high-quality data is available, and show better scaling to large action spaces with reduced overestimation bias compared to standard Q-learning approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper adapts DecQN, a value-decomposition method, to the offline reinforcement learning setting by incorporating multiple techniques. These include policy constraints to ensure safe learning from fixed datasets, conservative value estimation to prevent overestimation bias, implicit Q-learning for more stable updates, and one-step RL techniques for improved sample efficiency. The approach factorises the action space into components, allowing for more efficient representation and learning compared to treating actions as atomic units.

## Key Results
- Factorised approaches outperform atomic action representations in both maze navigation and DeepMind Control Suite tasks
- The method achieves expert-level policies when sufficient high-quality data is available
- Factorised methods demonstrate better scaling to large action spaces and reduced overestimation bias compared to standard Q-learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The factorisation of action spaces allows the method to decompose complex decision-making into more manageable components, reducing the effective dimensionality of the learning problem. By incorporating policy constraints and conservative value estimation specifically designed for offline settings, the approach mitigates the common pitfalls of distributional shift and overestimation bias that plague standard Q-learning in offline scenarios. The combination of implicit Q-learning and one-step RL techniques further stabilises learning from fixed datasets, enabling more reliable policy improvement even with limited or imperfect data.

## Foundational Learning

**Value Decomposition**: Breaking down the Q-value function into components corresponding to factorised actions. *Why needed*: Enables more efficient representation in high-dimensional action spaces. *Quick check*: Verify decomposition reduces parameter count compared to full joint action space.

**Conservative Value Estimation**: Using techniques like CQL to prevent overestimation of action values. *Why needed*: Essential for stable learning from offline datasets without exploration. *Quick check*: Compare value estimates between conservative and standard approaches on held-out data.

**Policy Constraints**: Regularising learned policies to stay close to behavior policy. *Why needed*: Prevents distributional shift and out-of-distribution actions in offline setting. *Quick check*: Measure KL divergence between learned and behavior policies.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Preprocessing → Factorised Action Space → DecQN with Constraints → Policy + Value Networks → Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The essential sequence is dataset → factorised representation → constrained DecQN training → policy extraction. The factorisation step is critical as it enables efficient representation and learning.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper trades computational complexity of factorisation against improved sample efficiency and scalability. The constraint mechanisms add computational overhead but provide essential stability for offline learning.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate inadequate factorisation, overly restrictive constraints, or insufficient high-quality data. High variance in value estimates suggests conservative estimation may be too aggressive.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run on a simple factorisable environment (e.g., factored gridworld) to verify basic functionality
2. Compare factorised vs atomic action representations on small-scale tasks
3. Test constraint strength sensitivity on a controlled benchmark

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively narrow scope of benchmark environments tested, primarily focusing on maze navigation and DeepMind Control Suite tasks
- Evaluation of performance under varying dataset quality levels could benefit from more extensive analysis across different domains
- Empirical evidence for better scaling to large action spaces is limited to specific cases

## Confidence

High: The paper's adaptation of DecQN with policy constraints and conservative value estimation for offline settings is well-grounded in established RL theory.

Medium: The claim that factorised approaches outperform atomic action representations is supported by experimental results, but the sample size of tested environments is limited.

Medium: The assertion of reduced overestimation bias compared to standard Q-learning is demonstrated but requires further validation across diverse action space configurations.

## Next Checks

1. Test the proposed method on a broader range of benchmark environments, including more complex and varied task structures, to validate the generalizability of the observed improvements.

2. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of each adaptation technique (policy constraints, conservative value estimation, implicit Q-learning, and one-step RL) to overall performance.

3. Evaluate the method's performance on tasks with extremely large action spaces (e.g., >1000 discrete actions) to verify the claimed scalability advantage and identify potential limitations.
