# Calib3D: Calibrating Model Preferences for Reliable 3D Scene Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.17010
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17010
- Reference count: 40
- First comprehensive benchmark for evaluating reliability and uncertainty estimation of 3D scene understanding models

## Executive Summary
Calib3D introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the reliability and uncertainty estimation of 3D scene understanding models. The study evaluates 28 state-of-the-art models across 10 diverse datasets spanning driving, indoor, and synthetic scenarios, including challenging conditions like adverse weather and sensor corruptions. Despite high accuracy, existing models frequently fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, undermining their applicability in safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, the authors introduce DeptS, a depth-aware scaling method that dynamically adjusts model confidence based on depth information, significantly improving calibration performance.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates 28 state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models across 10 diverse datasets using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as the primary metric. The proposed DeptS method uses depth-aware scaling with entropy-based selection between two temperature parameters T1 and T2, where T1 > T2. The depth-correlation coefficient α = k1 · d + k2 modulates the temperature parameters to reduce overconfidence for distant points with high entropy predictions. The benchmark also evaluates existing calibration methods including temperature scaling, logistic scaling, Dirichlet scaling, and meta-calibration.

## Key Results
- Existing 3D models achieve high accuracy but exhibit poor calibration, with ECE values indicating significant overconfidence
- DeptS outperforms existing calibration methods, achieving the lowest ECE across multiple datasets and model architectures
- Model capacity and data resolution impact calibration, with larger models and higher resolutions increasing ECE
- DeptS maintains accuracy while improving calibration, addressing the typical tradeoff between these metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DeptS improves calibration by dynamically scaling logits based on depth-correlated confidence
- Mechanism: DeptS uses a depth-aware coefficient α = k1 · d_i + k2 to modulate temperature parameters (T1, T2), reducing overconfidence for distant points with high entropy predictions
- Core assumption: Overconfidence correlates with both prediction entropy and depth; distant points are systematically overconfident
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we design a depth-correlated temperature to dynamically adjust the logits distribution based on the depth information"
  - [section] "LiDAR points with large depth values... tend to have low accuracy... the confidence scores... do not decrease correspondingly"
- Break condition: If depth and entropy are not predictive of miscalibration, the scaling becomes arbitrary and degrades accuracy

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Calibration methods like temperature scaling and meta-calibration reduce ECE by aligning confidence with accuracy
- Mechanism: Temperature scaling applies a uniform scalar T to logits; meta-calibration switches between random predictions and base calibrator based on entropy threshold
- Core assumption: A single temperature parameter or entropy-based selection can correct global miscalibration
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "a simple extension of the Platt scaling... is effective in improving the model calibration"
  - [section] "temperature scaling [36] is useful in improving calibration"
- Break condition: If miscalibration is not uniform across classes or data modalities, a single scalar cannot resolve it

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model capacity and data resolution impact calibration; larger models and higher resolutions increase ECE
- Mechanism: Larger networks and finer voxel/raster resolutions capture more complex features but amplify overconfidence in ambiguous regions
- Core assumption: Model capacity and input resolution correlate with overfitting and miscalibration
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "models with fewer parameters yield lower calibration errors"
  - [section] "more range view cells or smaller voxel sizes lead to increased calibration errors"
- Break condition: If capacity/resolution improvements consistently improve both accuracy and calibration, the tradeoff is invalid

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
  - Why needed here: ECE is the primary metric for measuring the gap between confidence and accuracy in point-wise segmentation
  - Quick check question: If a model has accuracy 0.9 at confidence bin [0.8, 0.9], what is its ECE contribution from that bin?

- Concept: Aleatoric vs Epistemic Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: Aleatoric captures sensor noise and data variation; epistemic captures model knowledge gaps. Both are addressed in the benchmark
  - Quick check question: Which uncertainty type is irreducible even with more data?

- Concept: Temperature Scaling in Calibration
  - Why needed here: It is the baseline post-hoc calibration method used to adjust logits distribution
  - Quick check question: What happens to predicted probabilities when temperature T > 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (LiDAR point cloud) -> Backbone (28 state-of-the-art 3D models) -> Calibration (TempS, LogiS, DiriS, MetaC, DeptS) -> Output (Calibrated probabilities per point) -> Evaluation (ECE, mIoU, domain-shift robustness)
- Critical path: 1. Load point cloud → 2. Forward through model → 3. Compute logits → 4. Apply calibration → 5. Measure ECE and mIoU
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth-aware scaling vs. uniform scaling: DeptS handles spatial bias but adds depth dependency
  - Calibration vs. accuracy preservation: Meta-calibration can lose accuracy; DeptS aims to preserve it
- Failure signatures:
  - ECE improves but mIoU drops → over-regularization
  - ECE worsens after calibration → incorrect temperature or entropy threshold
  - Calibration benefits vanish in domain shift → overfitting to training depth distribution
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare ECE before/after applying TempS on a single model-dataset pair
  2. Test DeptS with fixed α (no depth dependence) to isolate depth effect
  3. Sweep voxel size/resolution to observe calibration-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed depth-aware scaling (DeptS) method generalize to other 3D perception tasks beyond semantic segmentation, such as object detection or panoptic segmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates DeptS on 3D semantic segmentation tasks but does not explore its effectiveness on other 3D perception tasks
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on 3D semantic segmentation and does not investigate the applicability of DeptS to other 3D perception tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating DeptS on a variety of 3D perception tasks, such as object detection, panoptic segmentation, or even depth estimation, would provide insights into its generalizability

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the performance of DeptS to the choice of the entropy threshold parameter (η) and the depth-correlation coefficient parameters (k1 and k2)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that η, k1, and k2 are learnable parameters but does not provide an in-depth analysis of their impact on DeptS performance
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct an ablation study or sensitivity analysis to understand how the choice of these parameters affects DeptS performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting an ablation study or sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of different values of η, k1, and k2 on DeptS performance would provide insights into its robustness and optimal configuration

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DeptS perform in scenarios with dynamic objects or moving sensors, where depth information might be less reliable or noisy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on static scenes and does not explicitly address scenarios with dynamic objects or moving sensors
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate DeptS in scenarios where depth information might be less reliable or noisy, such as scenes with moving objects or sensors
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating DeptS in scenarios with dynamic objects or moving sensors, such as autonomous driving in urban environments, would provide insights into its robustness in challenging conditions

## Limitations
- DeptS effectiveness depends critically on the assumption that overconfidence correlates with depth and entropy
- All evaluated calibration methods are post-hoc and may not address root causes of miscalibration in model architecture or training
- Claims about epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty decomposition are asserted but not empirically separated in results

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: ECE calculations are standard and reproducible; 10 diverse datasets provide robust evaluation scope
- **Medium confidence**: Depth-aware scaling mechanism is plausible but untested on non-LiDAR modalities; calibration-accuracy tradeoffs depend on model capacity/resolution but exact bounds unclear
- **Low confidence**: Claims about epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty decomposition are asserted but not empirically separated in results

## Next Checks
1. Test DeptS on camera-only and multi-modal 3D datasets (e.g., nuScenes, Argoverse) to verify depth-dependence assumption
2. Isolate depth effect by comparing DeptS with fixed α (no depth correlation) to quantify depth's contribution to calibration gains
3. Evaluate calibration under adversarial depth corruptions (e.g., depth warping, dropout) to stress-test depth-aware assumptions
