# The Benefits of a Concise Chain of Thought on Problem-Solving in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.05618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05618
- Authors: Matthew Renze; Erhan Guven
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: CCoT reduces response length by 48.70% while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting, a technique that combines step-by-step reasoning with explicit conciseness instructions to reduce token usage while preserving problem-solving accuracy. Tested across 1,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten domains using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, CCoT achieved a 48.70% reduction in response length and 22.67% cost savings. While GPT-4 maintained accuracy across all domains, GPT-3.5 experienced a 27.69% accuracy drop specifically on math problems, suggesting model-dependent effectiveness.

## Method Summary
The study compared three prompting techniques (answer-only, standard CoT, and CCoT) across 1,000 MCQA problems from ten domains using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. CCoT combines "think step-by-step" with "be concise" instructions plus few-shot examples. Response length and accuracy were measured, with Mann-Whitney U tests assessing statistical significance. The standardized problem format and prompt templates are detailed in the appendix.

## Key Results
- CCoT reduced average response length by 48.70% (GPT-3.5: 47.62%, GPT-4: 49.77%)
- Achieved 22.67% average per-token cost reduction
- GPT-4 maintained accuracy across all domains; GPT-3.5 dropped 27.69% on math problems
- Statistical significance confirmed via Mann-Whitney U tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CCoT works by combining step-by-step reasoning (CoT) with explicit conciseness instructions, allowing the model to produce only essential reasoning tokens.
- Mechanism: The model receives two constraints: "think step-by-step" and "be concise." This dual instruction filters out redundant reasoning steps while preserving the critical logical chain.
- Core assumption: The model can distinguish between essential and non-essential reasoning steps when explicitly prompted to be concise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CCoT prompting is a novel prompt engineering technique that combines the effectiveness of CoT prompting with the efficiency of concise prompting."
  - [section] "CCoT is achieved by instructing the LLM to both 'think step-by-step' and 'be concise'."
  - [corpus] Weak - related work focuses on output compression but doesn't directly test the dual-instruction mechanism.
- Break condition: If the model cannot distinguish essential reasoning steps, conciseness instructions will remove critical tokens and degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CCoT achieves cost savings by reducing output token count while maintaining accuracy through efficient reasoning path selection.
- Mechanism: The model learns to compress reasoning chains into minimal token sequences that still capture the logical flow, reducing output length by ~49% while preserving accuracy.
- Core assumption: The reasoning process can be compressed without losing accuracy because many intermediate steps are redundant or derivable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CCoT reduced average response length by 48.70% for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 while having a negligible impact on problem-solving performance."
  - [section] "These results have theoretical implications for AI researchers studying how LLMs perform step-by-step reasoning using CoT."
  - [corpus] Moderate - "Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost" supports the length-accuracy relationship.
- Break condition: If certain problem types require verbose reasoning (like complex math), compression will remove necessary steps and degrade accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The few-shot examples in CCoT prompt provide a template for concise reasoning that the model can generalize from.
- Mechanism: Concise example solutions demonstrate the expected reasoning pattern, teaching the model to produce similarly compressed chains for new problems.
- Core assumption: Few-shot examples effectively communicate the desired reasoning style to the model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CCoT is achieved by instructing the LLM to both 'think step-by-step' and 'be concise'. In addition, the LLM is provided with few-shot examples that include a sample problem and a concise solution."
  - [section] "The one-shot example also included a more concise CoT in its solution."
  - [corpus] Missing - no direct evidence about the impact of few-shot examples on conciseness in CoT.
- Break condition: If the model cannot generalize from few-shot examples to new problem types, it will either produce verbose responses or miss critical reasoning steps.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how step-by-step reasoning improves LLM performance is essential to grasp why combining it with conciseness works.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary benefit of CoT prompting according to the literature?

- Concept: Token-based pricing and efficiency
  - Why needed here: The cost savings analysis depends on understanding that LLM APIs charge per token, making output length directly proportional to cost.
  - Quick check question: How does reducing output tokens translate to cost savings in LLM APIs?

- Concept: Statistical significance testing
  - Why needed here: The results use Mann-Whitney U tests instead of t-tests due to non-normal data distribution, which is important for interpreting the findings.
  - Quick check question: Why did the researchers choose Mann-Whitney U tests instead of t-tests for their analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt template (system prompt + example) -> LLM model (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) -> MCQA test set (1,000 questions across 10 domains) -> Evaluation metrics (response length, accuracy) -> Statistical analysis pipeline

- Critical path: Prompt → Model → Response → Token count → Accuracy → Cost calculation → Statistical validation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Conciseness vs. accuracy: Too much conciseness may remove essential reasoning steps
  - Few-shot examples vs. generalization: More examples may improve consistency but reduce flexibility
  - Problem domain coverage: Some domains (like math) may be more sensitive to conciseness than others

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drop when response length is compressed beyond a threshold
  - Inconsistent performance across problem domains
  - GPT-3.5 showing more sensitivity to conciseness than GPT-4

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CCoT vs. standard CoT on a small subset of problems to verify the dual-instruction mechanism works
  2. Measure response length reduction across different problem domains to identify sensitivity patterns
  3. Vary the "be concise" instruction strength to find the optimal balance between length reduction and accuracy preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CCoT performance vary across different problem domains beyond math, and what specific types of problems show the greatest sensitivity to conciseness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows GPT-3.5 incurs a 27.69% accuracy drop on math problems with CCoT, while other domains show negligible impact
- Why unresolved: The study only tested ten problem domains, and the analysis didn't identify specific problem characteristics that make math problems more sensitive to conciseness
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing CCoT across a broader range of problem types with detailed error analysis to identify patterns in which problem characteristics correlate with performance degradation

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects or tokens of the CoT are essential for problem-solving versus superfluous, and can we identify a minimal effective CoT structure?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that CCoT can reduce tokens by 48.70% while maintaining accuracy, suggesting only a subset of CoT tokens are necessary
- Why unresolved: The study reduced verbosity through general instructions to "be concise" rather than analyzing which specific reasoning steps are critical
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed token-level analysis comparing effective vs ineffective CoTs, or experiments that systematically remove specific reasoning steps to identify minimal necessary components

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the effectiveness of CCoT generalize to other LLM architectures beyond GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, particularly open-source models like Llama or Claude?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors specifically note their study was limited to two GPT models and recommend testing other LLMs
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested OpenAI's proprietary GPT models, leaving uncertainty about whether the findings apply to the broader LLM landscape
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experiments with multiple open-source and proprietary LLM architectures to determine if CCoT's benefits are universal or model-specific

## Limitations

- The 27.69% accuracy drop in GPT-3.5 math problems reveals domain-specific sensitivity to conciseness
- The mechanism by which CCoT distinguishes essential from non-essential reasoning steps lacks direct empirical validation
- Results are limited to OpenAI's GPT models, leaving uncertainty about generalizability to other LLM architectures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The length reduction measurements and cost savings calculations are straightforward and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that CCoT maintains accuracy across most domains is supported by statistical tests, but the exception for GPT-3.5 math problems reveals domain-specific sensitivity
- **Low Confidence**: The theoretical mechanism explaining how CCoT preserves reasoning quality while removing tokens lacks direct evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Model Capability Boundary Test**: Systematically vary model capability (e.g., test with smaller LLMs like GPT-3.0 or open-source alternatives) to identify the minimum model capability threshold below which CCoT degrades accuracy across all domains, not just math.

2. **Token Importance Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies where tokens are removed from CoT responses in order of importance (as determined by a separate model) to quantify how many tokens can be removed before accuracy drops below CCoT performance, testing whether CCoT is truly optimizing or simply achieving lucky compression.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Test CCoT on novel problem domains not represented in the original 1,000 questions (e.g., legal reasoning, creative writing) to evaluate whether the few-shot examples provide sufficient templates for generalization or if the method is overfitting to the specific domains tested.
