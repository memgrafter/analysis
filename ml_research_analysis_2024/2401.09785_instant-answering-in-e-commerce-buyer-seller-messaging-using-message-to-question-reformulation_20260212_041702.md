# Instant Answering in E-Commerce Buyer-Seller Messaging using Message-to-Question Reformulation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.09785
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09785
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: M2Q reformulates lengthy buyer messages into succinct questions, enabling integration with federated QA systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents MESSAGE-TO-QUESTION (M2Q), a low-latency sequence-to-sequence approach for automatically answering customer inquiries in e-commerce buyer-seller messaging. The core method reformulates lengthy buyer messages into succinct questions by identifying and extracting the most salient information, enabling integration with existing federated QA systems. Evaluation shows M2Q yields relative increases of 757% in question understanding and 1,746% in answering rate compared to baselines. Live deployment demonstrates significant benefits: sellers are saved from manually responding to millions of messages per year, and customers experience accelerated purchase decisions by receiving instant answers instead of waiting hours to days for replies.

## Method Summary
The M2Q approach uses a sequence-to-sequence model to transform lengthy buyer messages into concise questions suitable for existing QA systems. The system identifies and extracts salient information from messages, reformulating them into question format that can be processed by federated QA infrastructure. This low-latency solution operates without requiring modifications to the underlying QA systems, making it deployable as an intermediary layer between messaging and answering components.

## Key Results
- 757% relative increase in question understanding compared to baselines
- 1,746% relative increase in answering rate compared to baselines
- Live deployment saves sellers from manually responding to millions of messages annually while accelerating customer purchase decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging sequence-to-sequence models to bridge the gap between natural, lengthy buyer messages and the structured question format required by QA systems. By reformulating messages into succinct questions, the system can effectively extract the core intent and salient information that existing QA infrastructure can process. This transformation enables automatic answering without requiring changes to the underlying QA systems, making it a practical solution for real-world deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Neural architectures that map input sequences to output sequences; needed for transforming message text to question format; quick check: can process variable-length inputs and generate coherent outputs
- **Question Understanding Metrics**: Evaluation measures for assessing how well questions are interpreted by QA systems; needed to quantify improvements; quick check: correlates with downstream answering performance
- **Federated QA Systems**: Distributed question answering infrastructure that operates across multiple data sources; needed as the target system for M2Q integration; quick check: accepts standardized question formats
- **Message Salience Detection**: Techniques for identifying important information in text; needed for effective reformulation; quick check: preserves critical buyer intent while reducing message length
- **Low-Latency Processing**: Systems optimized for minimal response time; needed for real-time messaging applications; quick check: maintains sub-second response times

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Buyer Message -> M2Q Reformulator -> Federated QA System -> Answer Generator

**Critical Path**: Message input → Salience extraction → Question reformulation → QA system query → Answer retrieval → Response delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Chose sequence-to-sequence over rule-based approaches for better generalization across diverse message types
- Prioritized low latency over perfect accuracy to maintain real-time messaging experience
- Used existing QA infrastructure rather than building new answering capabilities to reduce deployment complexity

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Reformulation produces questions that miss key buyer intent
- QA system cannot process reformulated questions despite correct formatting
- Latency exceeds acceptable thresholds for real-time messaging
- False positives where automatic answers are provided inappropriately

**First 3 Experiments to Run**:
1. Measure baseline message-to-question reformulation accuracy on a held-out test set
2. Compare M2Q performance against rule-based message summarization approaches
3. Evaluate end-to-end system latency from message receipt to answer delivery

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements lack specific baseline metrics for proper context
- Evaluation methodology does not detail measurement of false positives in automated answering
- Paper focuses on successful deployments without reporting failure cases or error rates in production
- Proprietary nature of deployment data limits independent verification of claims

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core technical approach of message-to-question reformulation using sequence-to-sequence models is well-established in NLP literature. The general claim that reformulating lengthy buyer messages into succinct questions can improve integration with QA systems is theoretically sound.

- **Medium Confidence**: The specific performance numbers (757% and 1,746% improvements) and the claim of saving sellers from millions of messages annually are difficult to independently verify due to the lack of baseline metrics and proprietary deployment details.

- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that customers experience "accelerated purchase decisions" is supported by the reduced response time but lacks direct measurement of actual purchase behavior changes.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the M2Q reformulation component from improvements in the underlying federated QA system, using controlled experiments with identical baseline systems.

2. Implement comprehensive error analysis on production data to measure false positive rates, inappropriate answer generation, and edge cases where M2Q fails to capture critical information from lengthy buyer messages.

3. Perform A/B testing with real users to measure actual conversion rate changes and customer satisfaction scores, comparing scenarios with instant answers versus traditional seller response times.
