core_contribution: The paper proposes a generalized filtering framework called convolutional
  Bayesian filtering, which extends the standard Bayesian filtering by transforming
  the transition and output probabilities into convolutional forms. This is achieved
  by adding an additional event that stipulates an inequality condition, allowing

# Convolutional Bayesian Filtering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.00481
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00481
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Generalized filtering framework that transforms standard Bayesian filtering into convolutional forms to explicitly handle model mismatch

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces convolutional Bayesian filtering, a novel framework that extends standard Bayesian filtering by incorporating inequality constraints through convolutional forms. The key innovation is transforming transition and output probabilities into convolutional forms by adding an additional event that stipulates inequality conditions, allowing for more nuanced consideration of model mismatch. The framework generalizes standard Bayesian filtering and enables robust filtering algorithms that can be designed by only altering noise covariance matrices while maintaining the conjugate nature of Gaussian distributions.

## Method Summary
The convolutional Bayesian filtering framework generalizes standard Bayesian filtering by defining convolutional conditional probabilities that incorporate inequality constraints between predicted and observed states. The framework operates by substituting standard total probability and Bayes' law with convolutional versions (6a) and (6b), which transform the conditional probabilities into convolution-like integrals. For Gaussian systems, analytical forms are derived when distance metrics are quadratic and threshold distributions are exponential. For non-Gaussian systems, an exponential density rescaling technique approximates the convolutional conditional probabilities by reformulating transition and output probabilities into exponential forms with fractional powers.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that convolutional Bayesian filtering encompasses standard Bayesian filtering as a special case when using Dirac delta distance metrics
- Shows that the framework enables robust Kalman filter family design by only altering noise covariance matrices while maintaining Gaussian conjugacy
- Introduces exponential density rescaling technique for approximating convolutional conditional probabilities in non-Gaussian systems
- Successfully applies the framework to reshape classic algorithms including Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and particle filter

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The convolutional conditional probability generalizes standard conditional probability by adding an inequality constraint, allowing explicit handling of model mismatch. The framework defines a new conditional probability by conditioning on an additional event where the distance between two random variables is bounded, transforming the conditional probability into a convolution-like integral. The method breaks down if the distance metric is not well-defined or the threshold distribution F(r) does not accurately represent the model mismatch.

### Mechanism 2
The framework encompasses standard Bayesian filtering as a special case when the distance metric is chosen as the Dirac delta function. When the distance metric d(y, z) is set to the Dirac delta function, the convolutional conditional probability reduces to the standard conditional probability, and the framework reduces to standard Bayesian filtering. The method breaks down if the Dirac delta function is not a valid representation of the inequality constraint.

### Mechanism 3
The exponential density rescaling technique approximates convolutional conditional probability for non-Gaussian systems by rescaling transition and output probabilities into fractional powers. When the distance metric is defined in terms of relative entropy, the transition and output probabilities can be approximated by reformulating them into exponential forms with fractional powers, simplifying computation. The method breaks down if the second-order Taylor approximation of relative entropy is not valid or the empirical distribution cannot be approximated by a Gaussian distribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the convolutional Bayesian filtering framework be extended to continuous-time systems? The paper acknowledges the significance of filtering theory for continuous-time systems and the need to explore its application to such systems, but primarily focuses on discrete-time systems without providing a detailed methodology for extending the framework.

### Open Question 2
What are the theoretical implications of the connection between the exponential density rescaling technique and the information bottleneck theory? The paper establishes a theoretical connection between these concepts but does not fully explore the broader implications or potential applications of this connection.

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of distance metric in the convolutional conditional probability affect the performance of the framework? The paper discusses the use of different distance metrics but does not provide a thorough analysis of their impact on the framework's performance across various system types and noise distributions.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness heavily depends on appropriate selection of distance metrics and threshold distributions, which are not always straightforward to determine in practice
- The exponential density rescaling technique relies on second-order Taylor approximations that may introduce significant errors when relative entropy cannot be accurately approximated by quadratic forms
- Computational complexity increases substantially compared to standard Bayesian filtering, particularly for particle filter implementations where resampling and weight calculations must incorporate convolutional probabilities

## Confidence

- High confidence: The mathematical derivation of the convolutional conditional probability and its reduction to standard conditional probability when using Dirac delta distance metrics
- Medium confidence: The exponential density rescaling technique's approximation accuracy for non-Gaussian systems
- Medium confidence: The empirical performance improvements shown in the experiments, though limited to specific benchmark systems

## Next Checks

1. Cross-validation of distance metric selection: Systematically evaluate the impact of different distance metrics (e.g., Mahalanobis, Wasserstein, relative entropy) and threshold distributions on estimation accuracy across diverse system types

2. Scalability analysis: Assess computational complexity and runtime performance as state dimension increases, comparing convolutional filters against standard robust alternatives

3. Real-world data validation: Apply the framework to experimental or industrial datasets with known model mismatch characteristics to verify performance claims beyond synthetic benchmarks
