- Primary result: Real-time relighting for novel-view synthesis using 3D Gaussians with PRT, achieving PSNR 33.63, SSIM 0.9438, LPIPS 0.0255

## Executive Summary
PRTGaussian introduces a novel approach for real-time relighting in novel-view synthesis by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT). The method addresses the challenge of decoupling lighting and reflectance from visual inputs, enabling high-quality relighting under arbitrary lighting conditions. By leveraging explicit 3D Gaussian representations and high-order spherical harmonics, PRTGaussian achieves efficient real-time rendering while maintaining visual quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
PRTGaussian employs a two-stage training process to learn scene geometry and radiance transfer separately. In stage 1, coarse geometry is reconstructed from multi-view images under uniform lighting using vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting. Stage 2 refines 3D Gaussians and learns light transport using an MLP encoder-decoder network that predicts radiance transfer vectors based on Gaussian positions. The final rendering combines these transfer vectors with Gaussian albedo and incident lighting represented in spherical harmonics, enabling real-time relighting under arbitrary conditions.

## Key Results
- PSNR of 33.63, SSIM of 0.9438, and LPIPS of 0.0255 on synthetic datasets
- Rendering speed of 0.0030s per frame for real-time performance
- Training time of approximately 15 minutes per scene on RTX 4090
- Effective relighting under arbitrary lighting conditions including HDRI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PRTGaussian uses a two-stage training process to decouple geometry and radiance transfer learning.
- Mechanism: In stage 1, a coarse point cloud is reconstructed from multi-view images under uniform lighting using vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting. In stage 2, the point cloud is converted to 3D Gaussians, and both the Gaussian attributes and radiance transfer coefficients are refined simultaneously.
- Core assumption: Joint optimization of geometry and appearance from OLAT data is too ambiguous without an initial coarse geometry.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We utilize a two-stage process: in the first stage, we reconstruct a coarse geometry of the object from multi-view images... In the second stage, we initialize 3D Gaussians with the obtained point cloud..."
  - [section]: "Due to the high ambiguity in jointly optimizing geometry and appearance, we first reconstruct a coarse geometry of the object from multi-view images under uniform lighting."
- Break condition: If the initial geometry reconstruction fails to capture the object's basic shape, the radiance transfer learning in stage 2 will produce poor results.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Radiance transfer is modeled using high-order spherical harmonics coefficients predicted by an MLP encoder-decoder network.
- Mechanism: Each Gaussian's position is encoded into a high-dimensional vector, which is decoded to produce its radiance transfer vector. The final color is computed by combining this transfer vector with the Gaussian's albedo and the incident light (also represented in spherical harmonics).
- Core assumption: The radiance transfer at each Gaussian can be represented as a function of its position alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By estimating the radiance transfer based on high-order spherical harmonics, we achieve a balance between capturing detailed relighting effects and maintaining computational efficiency."
  - [section]: "We use two networks to separately encode and decode the radiance transfer vector... we first encode the position µ of each Gaussian into a higher-dimensional vector..."
- Break condition: If the spherical harmonics order is too low, high-frequency lighting effects like sharp shadows cannot be captured.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The explicit 3D Gaussian representation enables real-time rendering while maintaining high visual quality.
- Mechanism: 3D Gaussians are projected onto 2D planes using tile-based rasterization, which is computationally efficient compared to volumetric ray sampling used in implicit representations like NeRF.
- Core assumption: The explicit Gaussian representation can capture sufficient scene detail while allowing efficient forward rendering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Compared to implicit representations like NeRF, this explicit representation allows for more efficient forward rendering, resulting in faster training and inference speeds."
  - [section]: "The explicit nature of this representation also makes it more suitable for tasks such as scene editing and dynamic reconstruction."
- Break condition: If the Gaussian distribution becomes too dense, rasterization performance may degrade, negating the speed advantage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT)
  - Why needed here: PRT allows the method to precompute how light interacts with the object's geometry, enabling real-time relighting by simply changing the lighting coefficients.
  - Quick check question: What is the key insight that makes PRT efficient for real-time rendering?

- Concept: Spherical Harmonics (SH)
  - Why needed here: SH provides a compact, low-frequency representation of lighting and transfer functions, which can be efficiently computed and combined for rendering.
  - Quick check question: How does the order of SH basis functions affect the quality and efficiency of lighting representation?

- Concept: 3D Gaussian Splatting
  - Why needed here: 3DGS offers an explicit, efficient scene representation that enables real-time rendering while maintaining high visual quality, unlike implicit volumetric representations.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using 3D Gaussians over voxels or point clouds for scene representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Acquisition -> Stage 1 (Coarse geometry reconstruction) -> Stage 2 (Radiance transfer learning) -> Rendering -> Loss computation

- Critical path:
  1. Data synthesis (25 camera positions × 200 light positions)
  2. Stage 1: Multi-view uniform lighting reconstruction
  3. Stage 2: Gaussian initialization and joint refinement
  4. Real-time rendering with arbitrary lighting

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Spherical harmonics order (n=9): Higher order captures more detail but increases memory/computation
  - Two-stage training: Separates geometry from appearance learning to avoid ambiguity
  - Explicit Gaussian representation: Enables real-time rendering but may struggle with very fine details

- Failure signatures:
  - Blurry geometry or lighting artifacts: Likely stage 1 reconstruction issues
  - Incorrect lighting or shadows: Possible radiance transfer learning problems
  - Slow training/rendering: Gaussian distribution too dense or SH order too high

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate stage 1 reconstruction quality on simple geometry (e.g., sphere)
  2. Test radiance transfer learning on a single Gaussian with known transfer function
  3. Evaluate real-time rendering performance with varying Gaussian counts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the method be extended to handle specular materials and view-dependent effects beyond diffuse materials?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that it "currently only considers diffuse materials and does not consider specular highlights and other view-dependent effects."
- Why unresolved: The current method's reliance on precomputed radiance transfer using spherical harmonics is inherently limited to diffuse materials, as it does not account for the directional dependence of specular reflections.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing a variant of the method that incorporates view direction as an additional input to the radiance transfer network, and evaluating its performance on datasets with specular materials.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the trade-offs between using higher-order spherical harmonics and computational efficiency for capturing high-frequency lighting effects like sharp shadows?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the use of 9th-order spherical harmonics and mentions that while higher orders can capture more detail, they also increase memory and computational requirements.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific trade-offs between the order of spherical harmonics and the quality of rendered shadows, leaving the optimal balance unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying orders of spherical harmonics and quantitatively measuring the impact on shadow sharpness and rendering performance, providing a clear trade-off curve.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the two-stage training process compare to a joint optimization approach in terms of final rendering quality and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a two-stage training process to mitigate the high ambiguity and complexity of jointly optimizing geometry and appearance, but does not compare it directly to a joint optimization approach.
- Why unresolved: While the two-stage process is proposed as a solution to the challenges of joint optimization, its effectiveness relative to a joint approach is not empirically demonstrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing a joint optimization variant of the method and conducting a head-to-head comparison with the two-stage approach on the same datasets, measuring both rendering quality and training time.

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (Supported by clear evidence):
- The two-stage training process effectively separates geometry reconstruction from radiance transfer learning
- The explicit 3D Gaussian representation enables real-time rendering speeds
- Spherical harmonics of order 9 provides adequate low-frequency lighting representation

**Medium Confidence** (Evidence present but with limitations):
- The method's ability to handle high-frequency lighting effects (sharp shadows, specular highlights)

## Next Checks

1. **Geometry Reconstruction Validation**: Implement and test the stage 1 coarse geometry reconstruction on a simple geometric shape (e.g., sphere or cube) with known ground truth to verify the accuracy and robustness of the initial point cloud generation from multi-view uniform lighting.

2. **Radiance Transfer Learning Test**: Create a controlled experiment with a single Gaussian positioned at a known location and with a predetermined radiance transfer function. Validate that the MLP encoder-decoder network can accurately learn and reproduce this transfer function under varying lighting conditions.

3. **Real-time Rendering Performance**: Implement the tile-based rasterization pipeline and measure actual rendering speeds across different Gaussian counts (e.g., 10K, 100K, 1M) to verify the claimed 0.0030s per frame performance and identify any performance bottlenecks that may emerge with increased scene complexity.
