# Reinforcement Learning from Multi-role Debates as Feedback for Bias Mitigation in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.10160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10160
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: RLDF significantly reduces bias in LLMs through multi-role debates, outperforming existing methods while maintaining response quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by introducing Reinforcement Learning from Multi-role Debates as Feedback (RLDF). The approach replaces human feedback in traditional RLHF with feedback generated through structured debates among LLMs. By having LLMs assume different roles and engage in debates on generated topics, the method creates datasets containing both high-bias and low-bias instances. These datasets train reward models that guide LLMs to produce less biased outputs through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in bias scores while maintaining or improving response quality across multiple LLM architectures.

## Method Summary
RLDF involves LLMs in multi-role debates to generate datasets with paired high-bias and low-bias statements. The process includes two modes: self-reflection where the same LLM debates itself, and teacher-student where a more advanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the process. Debates are structured with different roles (debaters and referee) who generate and evaluate statements over multiple rounds. The resulting dataset trains a reward model that scores bias in text, which then guides reinforcement learning to fine-tune the target LLM. The approach is evaluated on BBQ and custom datasets across five bias types, showing significant bias reduction while maintaining response quality.

## Key Results
- RLDF significantly improves bias scores on BBQ dataset compared to Chain-of-Thought, Supervised Fine-tuning, and RL with AI Feedback
- The teacher-student mode achieves better bias mitigation than self-reflection mode across all tested LLMs
- RLDF maintains or improves response quality metrics (Communication Effectiveness and Logical Soundness) while reducing bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-role debates expose and reduce bias through iterative self-reflection and peer feedback.
- Mechanism: LLMs assume different roles representing diverse identities and engage in debates on generated topics. An impartial referee role evaluates and scores the bias in each statement, categorizing them as high or low bias based on severity. This process iterates over multiple rounds, with debaters refining their arguments to achieve lower bias scores.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively recognize and mitigate their own biases when placed in structured debate scenarios with clear evaluation criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We utilize LLMs in multi-role debates to create a dataset that includes both high-bias and low-bias instances for training the reward model in reinforcement learning."
  - [section] "We let LLMs act as different roles involved in a debate to construct a robust dataset which contains instances of both high and low bias for training the reward model in RL framework."
  - [corpus] "Weak corpus evidence for mechanism details; no direct evidence for effectiveness of multi-role debates in bias reduction."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The reward model trained on high-bias and low-bias pairs guides the LLM to generate less biased outputs through reinforcement learning.
- Mechanism: The dataset created from multi-role debates, containing paired high-bias and low-bias instances, is used to train a reward model. This model provides a scalar bias score for any given text. The LLM is then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with the reward model's feedback, iteratively improving its outputs to minimize bias.
- Core assumption: The reward model can accurately distinguish between high-bias and low-bias content and provide meaningful feedback for the LLM to learn from.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach comprises two modes: (1) self-reflection, where the same LLM participates in multi-role debates, and (2) teacher-student, where a more advanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the LLM to perform this task."
  - [section] "Formally, a reward model (Ziegler et al. 2019; Stiennon et al. 2020) or preference model (Amanda et al. 2021) can be denoted as a mapping function Rθ : X × Y → R with parameters θ, which provides a real-valued reward (or preference) score Rθ(x, y)."
  - [corpus] "No direct corpus evidence for the effectiveness of the reward model in guiding bias reduction."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using a more advanced LLM as a teacher in the teacher-student mode enhances the effectiveness of bias mitigation.
- Mechanism: In the teacher-student mode, a more advanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the original LLM in performing multi-role debates and creating less biased content. This approach leverages the superior capabilities of the advanced LLM to improve the bias recognition and mitigation abilities of the original LLM.
- Core assumption: A more advanced LLM can effectively guide a less advanced LLM in recognizing and mitigating biases through structured debates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach comprises two modes: (1) self-reflection, where the same LLM participates in multi-role debates, and (2) teacher-student, where a more advanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the LLM to perform this task."
  - [section] "In teacher-student mode, the dataset is constructed by GPT-3.5-turbo."
  - [corpus] "No direct corpus evidence for the effectiveness of teacher-student mode in bias reduction."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: RLHF is the traditional approach for aligning LLMs with human values, and RLDF aims to replace human feedback with feedback from multi-role debates.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between RLHF and RLDF in terms of the source of feedback?

- Concept: Bias in Large Language Models
  - Why needed here: Understanding the nature and sources of bias in LLMs is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: What are the potential sources of bias in LLMs, and how can they negatively impact user experience and societal outcomes?

- Concept: Multi-role Debates and Structured Debates
  - Why needed here: Multi-role debates provide a structured framework for exposing and reducing biases in LLMs through iterative self-reflection and peer feedback.
  - Quick check question: How do multi-role debates differ from regular debates, and what are the key components of a structured debate framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Multi-role Debate Generator -> 2. Paired Dataset Creator -> 3. Reward Model Trainer -> 4. RL Fine-tuning Module -> 5. Evaluation Module

- Critical path:
  1. Generate multi-role debate datasets
  2. Train the reward model on high-bias and low-bias pairs
  3. Fine-tune the LLM using reinforcement learning with the reward model's feedback
  4. Evaluate the bias mitigation effectiveness

- Design tradeoffs:
  1. Number of roles and debate rounds: More roles and rounds may lead to better bias exposure but increase computational cost
  2. Dataset size: Larger datasets may improve reward model accuracy but require more resources to generate and train on
  3. Teacher-student vs. self-reflection mode: Teacher-student mode may be more effective but requires a more advanced LLM

- Failure signatures:
  1. Reward model fails to accurately distinguish between high-bias and low-bias content
  2. Reinforcement learning process does not lead to meaningful improvements in LLM outputs
  3. Multi-role debates do not effectively expose or reduce biases

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate a small multi-role debate dataset for a single bias type and train a reward model on it
  2. Fine-tune an LLM using reinforcement learning with the trained reward model and evaluate its bias mitigation effectiveness on a small test set
  3. Compare the bias mitigation effectiveness of self-reflection mode and teacher-student mode using a larger dataset and more diverse bias types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the long-term stability of bias mitigation achieved through RLDF? Does the model maintain reduced bias over extended periods or after further training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates immediate effectiveness of RLDF but does not address long-term stability or potential bias resurgence.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on immediate post-training results without longitudinal analysis or testing the model's performance after additional training or deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments tracking bias levels in RLDF-trained models over time, with periodic re-evaluation after additional training cycles or real-world usage.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does RLDF perform on bias types not included in the training dataset? Can it generalize to new or unseen bias categories?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests RLDF on five specific bias types but does not explore its effectiveness on novel or unseen bias categories.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation is limited to predefined bias types, and there's no investigation into the model's ability to handle or identify biases outside the training scope.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing RLDF on a diverse set of previously unseen bias types and measuring its performance compared to baseline methods on these new categories.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational efficiency of RLDF compared to other bias mitigation methods, especially at scale?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper mentions resource requirements for self-reflection and teacher-student modes, it does not provide a detailed comparative analysis of computational efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on effectiveness but lacks a comprehensive comparison of computational costs, including training time, memory usage, and scalability across different model sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a thorough benchmarking study comparing RLDF's computational requirements (training time, memory usage, etc.) against other bias mitigation methods across various model sizes and hardware configurations.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation on diverse, real-world datasets beyond the BBQ benchmark and custom Multi-Role Debate dataset
- Black box nature of LLM debate process with no detailed analysis of how specific debate interactions lead to bias reduction
- Reward model reliability concerns without independent verification that bias scores align with human judgment

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core methodology of using multi-role debates to generate bias-mitigated datasets is clearly described and the experimental framework is well-structured
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the teacher-student mode over self-reflection mode is demonstrated, but sample size and diversity may not be sufficient for definitive conclusions
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of results to real-world applications and diverse bias scenarios beyond tested categories, and long-term stability of bias mitigation

## Next Checks

1. **External Dataset Validation**: Test RLDF on at least two additional, diverse real-world datasets containing different types of biases not represented in the BBQ dataset. Measure both bias reduction and any potential degradation in general response quality.

2. **Human Evaluation Study**: Conduct a comprehensive human evaluation study where multiple annotators assess the bias levels and response quality of RLDF-mitigated LLMs versus baseline approaches. Include both bias experts and general users to capture different perspectives on what constitutes "biased" content.

3. **Ablation Study on Debate Parameters**: Systematically vary the number of debate roles (2-5), debate rounds (3-7), and dataset sizes (1,000-10,000) to identify the optimal configuration for different bias types and LLM sizes. Measure the trade-off between effectiveness and computational cost.
