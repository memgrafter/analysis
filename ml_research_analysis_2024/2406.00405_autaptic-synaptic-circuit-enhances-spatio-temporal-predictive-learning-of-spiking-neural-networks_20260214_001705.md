# Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00405
- Reference count: 34
- The STC model achieves 55.8% reduction in MSE compared to vanilla LIF on Moving MNIST and 63.0 MSE on TaxiBJ dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model that enhances Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for complex spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The model incorporates two learnable adaptive pathways inspired by biological autaptic synapses, improving temporal memory and spatial coordination in spiking neurons. The STC model demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline models on multiple benchmark datasets including Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, and KTH, while maintaining compatibility with existing spiking neuron models like PLIF and LM-H.

## Method Summary
The STC-LIF model extends the standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model by incorporating a spatio-temporal circuit with two dynamic modulation factors, β[t] and γ[t], that replace the fixed exponential leakage. These factors are computed from previous spike outputs and modulate both temporal and spatial aspects of the membrane potential update. The model uses group convolution operations to create synaptic connections between neighboring neurons within the same layer, enhancing spatial information processing. The architecture is compatible with other spiking neuron models and can be trained using backpropagation through time with gradient clipping.

## Key Results
- Achieves 55.8% reduction in MSE compared to vanilla LIF model on Moving MNIST dataset
- Obtains 63.0 MSE on TaxiBJ dataset, outperforming other adaptive models
- Demonstrates improved performance on DVS128 Gesture dataset for neuromorphic data recognition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The STC model enables better long-term dependency modeling by replacing the fixed exponential leakage with dynamic modulation factors β and γ.
- Mechanism: The dynamic factors β[t] and γ[t] allow the membrane potential to be amplified or attenuated based on recent spike history, preserving relevant information over longer time horizons while forgetting irrelevant information.
- Core assumption: The spiking neuron can effectively learn the modulation factors β[t] and γ[t] through backpropagation so that they preserve long-term information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory"
  - [section] "The STC-LIF model has the following advantages: (a): STC-LIF model can capture long-term dependency"
  - [corpus] Weak/no direct evidence for this specific mechanism; related work focuses on other adaptations
- Break condition: If the learned β and γ become constant or saturate to extremes, the model reverts to simple LIF behavior with fixed decay.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The STC model improves spatio-temporal representation by creating new synaptic connections between neurons within the same layer.
- Mechanism: The group convolution operations in the spatio-temporal circuit allow neurons to receive inputs from their spatial neighbors in addition to temporal feedback, enabling richer feature interactions.
- Core assumption: Local spatial connectivity patterns within a layer capture meaningful spatial correlations in the input data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we extend the concept of self-connection beyond individual neurons to include connections within the layer of neighboring cells"
  - [section] "The spatio-temporal circuit forms new synaptic connections, thereby enhancing the interaction of spatio-temporal information"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; related work focuses on different architectural adaptations
- Break condition: If the group size is too small or too large, the spatial correlations may be poorly captured or become computationally prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The STC model provides dynamic parameters that adapt to different input sequences, improving generalization.
- Mechanism: The β[t] and γ[t] factors change dynamically based on spike outputs from the previous time step, allowing the same neuron to have different behaviors for different input patterns.
- Core assumption: The spiking neuron's output contains sufficient information to guide adaptive parameter changes that improve performance on varying input sequences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination"
  - [section] "The parameters of the STC-LIF model undergo dynamic changes during both training and inference"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; related work focuses on static adaptations
- Break condition: If the input patterns are too similar or the network is too shallow, dynamic parameters may not provide significant advantage over static parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the baseline model is essential to grasp what the STC model is improving upon
  - Quick check question: In the LIF model, what happens to the membrane potential when a spike occurs and how is historical information handled?

- Concept: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for SNNs
  - Why needed here: The paper claims improved gradient flow, so understanding how gradients propagate through spiking networks is crucial
  - Quick check question: What challenge does BPTT face when training standard LIF models on long sequences and how does the STC model address this?

- Concept: Autaptic synapses in biological neurons
  - Why needed here: The STC model is biologically inspired, so understanding the biological mechanism helps explain the design choices
  - Quick check question: What are the two main functional roles of autaptic synapses in biological neurons and how are these roles implemented in the STC model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer → Convolution → Spiking neuron layer (LIF + STC circuit) → Group normalization → Repeat → Output layer
  - STC circuit components: Temporal circuit (β[t] modulation), Spatial circuit (γ[t] modulation), Group convolution operations
  - Key parameters: Membrane constant α, Firing threshold vth, Learnable weights Wgt and Wgs

- Critical path:
  1. Input spikes processed by convolution
  2. STC circuit computes β[t] and γ[t] from previous spike output
  3. Membrane potential updated with modulated inputs
  4. Spike generation and soft reset
  5. Output spikes passed to next layer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Group convolution vs global convolution: Group convolution reduces parameters and computation but may miss some spatial correlations
  - Dynamic vs static parameters: Dynamic parameters adapt to input but increase memory usage and complexity
  - Soft reset vs hard reset: Soft reset preserves more information but may slow convergence

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance similar to baseline LIF: Likely indicates β and γ have collapsed to zero or ineffective learning
  - Training instability: May indicate learning rates too high for the dynamic parameters
  - Memory overflow: May indicate insufficient GPU memory for the additional parameters in large models

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement baseline LIF model and verify it matches paper's reported performance on Moving MNIST
  2. Add STC circuit with group convolution (groups=16) and verify performance improvement over baseline
  3. Compare different group sizes (1, 8, 16, 32) to find optimal balance between performance and computation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the STC-LIF model's performance scale with increasing temporal dependencies in more complex datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the STC-LIF model outperforms other adaptive models on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, but it does not explore the limits of its performance with increasingly complex temporal dependencies.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on benchmark datasets with moderate temporal complexity, leaving the model's performance on datasets with longer-term dependencies untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the STC-LIF model on datasets with longer sequences and more intricate temporal patterns, such as those found in video understanding tasks, would provide insights into its scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the STC-LIF model on energy efficiency compared to other spiking neural network models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the biological realism and energy efficiency of spiking neural networks but does not provide a direct comparison of energy consumption between the STC-LIF model and other SNN models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates performance improvements, it does not address the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy in terms of energy usage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the energy consumption of the STC-LIF model against other SNN models during inference on neuromorphic hardware would clarify its energy efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the STC-LIF model generalize to tasks outside of spatio-temporal prediction, such as static image classification or reinforcement learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the STC-LIF model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models and can be extended to other models, but it does not explore its applicability to other types of tasks.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are confined to spatio-temporal prediction tasks, leaving its performance on other domains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the STC-LIF model to tasks like image classification or reinforcement learning and comparing its performance to state-of-the-art models in those domains would demonstrate its versatility.

## Limitations
- Lacks direct empirical evidence for how dynamic modulation factors β[t] and γ[t] specifically improve long-term dependency modeling
- Biological plausibility of extending autaptic synapses to group-level connections remains speculative
- Computational overhead of dynamic parameters and group convolutions may limit scalability to larger networks or real-time applications

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Performance improvements on benchmark datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, KTH) compared to baseline models

**Medium Confidence**: The general concept of enhancing SNNs with adaptive pathways inspired by biological mechanisms

**Low Confidence**: Specific claims about how β[t] and γ[t] modulation factors achieve long-term dependency modeling and the biological validity of group-level autaptic connections

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of temporal circuit (β[t]) versus spatial circuit (γ[t]) to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains
2. Analyze the learned β[t] and γ[t] values across different time steps and input patterns to verify they are indeed dynamic and meaningful rather than degenerate
3. Test the STC model on longer sequence lengths (beyond 20 time steps) to empirically validate the claimed improvement in long-term dependency modeling
