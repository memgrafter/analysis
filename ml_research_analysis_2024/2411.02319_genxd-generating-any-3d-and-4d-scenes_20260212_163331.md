# GenXD: Generating Any 3D and 4D Scenes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.02319
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02319
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Unified framework for generating high-quality 3D and 4D scenes from image inputs using multiview-temporal modules and masked latent conditioning

## Executive Summary
GenXD introduces a unified framework for generating both 3D and 4D scenes from image inputs, addressing the challenge of creating consistent multi-view images and videos. The key innovation is the multiview-temporal module, which disentangles spatial and temporal information through an α-fusing strategy, enabling seamless learning from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support any number of input views without modifying the network architecture. To address the lack of real-world 4D data, the authors introduce CamVid-30K, a large-scale dataset curated from videos with estimated camera poses and object motion strength. GenXD achieves superior performance compared to previous methods in both 3D and 4D generation tasks, including single-view and multi-view settings.

## Method Summary
GenXD is a diffusion-based framework that leverages masked latent conditioning and multiview-temporal modules to generate consistent 3D and 4D scenes. The model uses masked latent conditioning to support any number of input views by applying forward diffusion only to target frames while leaving conditioning frames unchanged. The multiview-temporal modules disentangle spatial and temporal information through an α-fusing strategy, where α is a learnable weight for 4D data (set to 0 for 3D). GenXD is trained on a combination of 3D datasets (Objaverse, MVImageNet, Co3D, Re10K, ACID) and 4D datasets (CamVid-30K, Objaverse-XL-Animation), with training proceeding in three stages: 3D data only, 3D+4D single view, and 3D+4D single/multi view.

## Key Results
- GenXD achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4D generation tasks, outperforming previous methods on FID and FVD metrics across multiple datasets
- The framework demonstrates superior 3D reconstruction quality with higher PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores compared to baselines
- GenXD successfully generates consistent multi-view 3D scenes with CLIP-I scores matching or exceeding specialized 3D generation methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Masked latent conditioning allows GenXD to support any number of input views without modifying the network architecture.
- **Mechanism**: By applying forward diffusion only to target frames and leaving conditioning frames unchanged, the model can integrate any number of conditioning views while maintaining positional information and eliminating the need for cross-attention layers.
- **Core assumption**: Conditioning frames retain their spatial relationships and influence target generation even when masked in the latent space.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views."
  - [section] "We leverage the mask latent conditioning... By masking out the noise in the conditioning images, GenXD can support any number of input views without modifying the network."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of masked conditioning in related papers
- **Break condition**: If conditioning frames lose their spatial context or positional information in the latent space, the model would fail to generate consistent multi-view outputs.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The α-fusing strategy effectively disentangles spatial and temporal information for unified 3D and 4D generation.
- **Mechanism**: By introducing a learnable weight α for 4D data and setting it to 0 for 3D data, GenXD can preserve multi-view information while learning temporal dynamics from 4D data, enabling seamless learning from both data types.
- **Core assumption**: Multi-view and temporal information can be effectively separated in the feature space and recombined through a learnable parameter.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data."
  - [section] "We propose an α-fusing strategy for 4D generation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable fusing weight, α, for 4D generation, with α set to 0 for 3D generation."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of α-fusing in related papers
- **Break condition**: If the feature space doesn't naturally separate spatial and temporal components, the α-fusing strategy would fail to disentangle the information effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The object motion field accurately captures true object movement by projecting dynamic objects into adjacent camera views.
- **Mechanism**: By tracking keypoints of object instances across frames and projecting them using aligned depth maps, GenXD can estimate object motion field that distinguishes true object movement from camera motion.
- **Core assumption**: Aligned depth maps provide accurate scale and position information for projecting keypoints between camera views.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "We represent the displacement of each 2D keypoint on the second camera view as object motion field... With the motion field for each object, we can estimate the global movement of an object by averaging the absolute magnitude of the motion field."
  - [section] "As shown in Fig. 3, when the camera is moving while the object remains static (second example), the motion strength is significantly smaller compared to videos with object motion."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of object motion field estimation in related papers
- **Break condition**: If depth alignment is inaccurate or keypoint tracking fails, the object motion field would not correctly represent true object movement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and camera pose estimation
  - Why needed here: GenXD requires accurate camera poses for both training data curation and generation, as camera information is essential for generating consistent views across different perspectives.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main steps of SfM and why is separating moving objects from static background crucial for accurate camera pose estimation?

- **Concept**: Diffusion models and latent space conditioning
  - Why needed here: GenXD builds upon latent diffusion models and extends them with custom conditioning mechanisms (masked latent conditions and multiview-temporal modules) to handle both 3D and 4D generation tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does mask latent conditioning differ from traditional conditioning methods in diffusion models, and what advantages does it provide for multi-view generation?

- **Concept**: 3D representations (NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting)
  - Why needed here: GenXD generates images that need to be lifted into 3D representations for rendering arbitrary views, requiring understanding of how to optimize these representations from generated samples.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, and why might one be preferred over the other for different generation tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Diffusion UNet backbone -> Multiview-temporal ResBlocks and Transformers -> Plücker ray camera conditioning -> Masked latent conditioning -> α-fusing mechanism
- **Critical path**: Camera pose estimation → Data curation with motion strength filtering → Masked latent conditioning → Multiview-temporal module processing → α-fusing for 3D/4D integration → 3D representation optimization
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using masked latent conditioning eliminates cross-attention layers (reducing parameters) but requires careful handling of conditioning frame positions; α-fusing enables unified training but adds complexity to the training pipeline.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor multi-view consistency suggests issues with conditioning mechanism or multiview-temporal modules; incorrect object motion indicates problems with motion field estimation or α-fusing; training instability may point to data curation issues or improper α initialization.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test single-view 3D generation with varying numbers of conditioning views to validate masked latent conditioning effectiveness
  2. Evaluate α-fusing by training separate models for 3D-only and 4D-only data, then comparing with unified training
  3. Validate object motion field estimation by comparing generated videos with and without motion strength filtering on curated dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas remain unexplored based on the presented work.

## Limitations
- The CamVid-30K dataset relies on SfM-derived camera poses and estimated object motion fields, which may introduce noise affecting model performance metrics
- The α-fusing strategy's effectiveness lacks direct ablation studies demonstrating its necessity versus simpler alternatives
- Evaluation focuses primarily on synthetic benchmarks rather than extensive real-world testing, limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Masked latent conditioning enabling arbitrary input views (well-supported by architectural description and empirical results across multiple datasets)
- **Medium Confidence**: α-fusing strategy effectiveness for unified 3D/4D learning (supported by performance gains but lacks direct ablation evidence)
- **Medium Confidence**: Object motion field accuracy for true object movement detection (demonstrated on curated dataset but not independently verified)

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on α-fusing**: Train separate models for 3D-only and 4D-only data, then compare performance against the unified model with varying α values to quantify the contribution of the fusing strategy.

2. **Cross-dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate GenXD on entirely unseen real-world datasets beyond CamVid-30K to verify generalization claims, particularly focusing on camera pose estimation robustness.

3. **Error Analysis on Motion Field Estimation**: Create a controlled test set with ground-truth object motions to quantify the accuracy of the proposed motion field estimation method and identify failure patterns.
