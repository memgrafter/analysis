# Surrealistic-like Image Generation with Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.14366
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14366
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: DALL-E 2 with 50-word ChatGPT prompts outperforms other models for surrealism-like image generation

## Executive Summary
This study explored generating surrealism-like images using vision-language models (DALL-E, Deep Dream Generator, DreamStudio) with base images and prompts. The primary finding was that DALL-E 2, when paired with ChatGPT-generated prompts (especially 50-word versions), outperformed the other models in producing images matching surrealism-like criteria. Longer prompts consistently yielded better results, while downscaling base images slightly improved outcomes compared to blurring. Deep Dream Generator performed best with simple YOLO labels. These findings highlight the potential of combining language models with image generation to inspire artistic creativity, with DALL-E 2 emerging as the most effective tool for creating surrealism-like imagery when provided with detailed textual guidance.

## Method Summary
The study used six realist paintings as base images and applied YOLO object detection to extract labels. ChatGPT-3 generated prompts of varying lengths (15 words, 50 words) with and without artist names. These prompts were used with DALL-E 2, Deep Dream Generator, and DreamStudio to generate images from both original and edited base images (downscaled and blurred). Eighteen artists evaluated the generated images through a five-part survey assessing surrealism-like qualities including dreamlike atmosphere, unexpected juxtapositions, and symbolism. The survey compared different model settings and prompt strategies to determine which combinations best produced surrealism-like imagery.

## Key Results
- DALL-E 2 with 50-word ChatGPT prompts produced the most surrealism-like images
- Longer prompts consistently yielded better results than shorter ones
- Downscaling base images performed better than blurring for image generation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DALL-E 2 with ChatGPT-generated 50-word prompts produces the most surrealistic-like images because longer prompts provide richer contextual guidance to the model.
- Mechanism: The model uses extended textual descriptions to infer compositional elements, symbolic references, and abstract concepts, enabling generation of more complex and layered imagery aligned with surrealist aesthetics.
- Core assumption: Vision-language models can interpret nuanced textual prompts and translate them into meaningful visual compositions that reflect surrealistic criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Longer prompts consistently yielded better results"
  - [section] "Longer prompts offer richer contextual information, enabling generative image models to produce more surrealistic-like results"
- Break condition: If the model fails to parse prompt semantics or the text exceeds effective input length, generation quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incorporating artist names (e.g., Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst) into prompts enhances surrealistic qualities by biasing generation toward recognized surrealist styles.
- Mechanism: Named stylistic references activate learned associations in the model linking those artists to their visual motifs, thereby shaping the output to emulate their surrealistic characteristics.
- Core assumption: The model has been trained on data associating artist names with distinctive visual styles, and these associations can be leveraged through prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "incorporating surrealistic artist names along with the ChatGPT generated prompt significantly enhances the surrealistic quality of the images"
  - [section] "DALL-E generated images with a higher resemblance to the specified artist’s style"
- Break condition: If artist names are absent from training data or not strongly associated with surrealistic imagery, the prompt will not influence style.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Downscaling base images improves generation outcomes compared to blurring because downscaling preserves essential structural cues while reducing noise.
- Mechanism: Smaller base images reduce computational load and allow the model to focus on core compositional features, while blurring may obscure critical visual information.
- Core assumption: Base image preprocessing influences the model's ability to interpret and transform source content into surrealistic outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "downscaled base images as input to the model increased in votes across generations, when contrasted with the utilization of blurred base images"
  - [section] "downscaling technique may outperform blurring in enhancing the quality of generated surrealistic artworks"
- Break condition: If the model is insensitive to base image preprocessing or relies more heavily on text, preprocessing effects diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-language model architecture (e.g., DALL-E 2)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how text-to-image models interpret and generate imagery is essential to explaining why prompt length and content affect output quality.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the text encoder in a vision-language model like DALL-E 2?
- Concept: Surrealism aesthetic principles (dreamlike atmosphere, unexpected juxtapositions, symbolism)
  - Why needed here: The evaluation criteria for generated images are based on these surrealist features, so understanding them is necessary to interpret the results.
  - Quick check question: How do unexpected juxtapositions contribute to the surrealistic quality of an image?
- Concept: YOLO object detection
  - Why needed here: YOLO labels were used to generate prompts; knowing how it works clarifies why object-based prompts were chosen and their limitations.
  - Quick check question: What type of output does YOLO provide for an input image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base image → YOLO → ChatGPT → DALL-E 2/Deep Dream/DreamStudio → Image → Survey → Evaluation
- Critical path: YOLO → ChatGPT → DALL-E 2 → Image → Survey → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt length vs. model input limits
  - Base image preprocessing choice (downscale vs. blur)
  - Text-only vs. image+text generation modes
  - Human evaluation subjectivity vs. automated metrics
- Failure signatures:
  - Low survey scores across all models
  - Inconsistent model behavior with same prompts
  - YOLO fails to detect relevant objects
  - ChatGPT produces irrelevant or repetitive prompts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate images with YOLO labels only (baseline)
  2. Generate images with 15-word ChatGPT prompts
  3. Generate images with 50-word ChatGPT prompts including artist names

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different base image editing techniques (e.g., contrast adjustment, color filtering, geometric transformations) beyond blurring and downscaling affect the surrealistic-like image generation quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only tested blurring and downscaling effects on base images, finding limited impact, suggesting other editing techniques might yield different results
- Why unresolved: The study's scope was limited to only two editing techniques (blurring and downscaling), leaving other potential editing methods unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of various image editing techniques (contrast, color filters, geometric transformations) on base images across multiple generative models, measuring their impact on surrealism-like qualities

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does incorporating artist names in prompts have a consistent effect across different art movements beyond surrealism (e.g., impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper found that including artist names improved surrealism-like qualities in DALL-E outputs but noted this wasn't tested for other art movements
- Why unresolved: The experiment only tested artist names within the surrealism context, without exploring other artistic styles or movements
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using artist names from various art movements across different generative models, measuring the consistency and effectiveness of this approach

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between prompt specificity and creativity for generating high-quality surrealistic-like images?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study found that longer prompts generally improved results, but didn't explore the relationship between prompt specificity, creativity, and image quality in detail
- Why unresolved: The paper tested prompt length but didn't systematically vary the balance between specific instructions and creative elements in prompts
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying prompt structure and content balance while measuring surrealism-like qualities and overall image quality metrics

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the resolution of generated images affect the perception of surrealism-like qualities by human evaluators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentioned DALL-E's limitation to square images but didn't investigate how different output resolutions impact artistic perception
- Why unresolved: The study focused on content and style rather than technical aspects like resolution that might influence artistic perception
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies generating images at different resolutions and having evaluators rate surrealism-like qualities across various resolution levels

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on subjective human evaluation by a small panel of 18 artists introduces potential bias
- Study does not explore alternative image preprocessing methods beyond downscaling and blurring
- Comparison between models is limited to a single generation per setting, which may not capture model variability

## Confidence

- High confidence: DALL-E 2 with longer ChatGPT prompts produces better surrealism-like images
- Medium confidence: Specific mechanisms (longer prompts, artist names, downscaling) due to limited exploration of alternative explanations
- Low confidence: Generalizability of results to other artistic styles or base images beyond the six realist paintings tested

## Next Checks

1. Apply computational methods (e.g., CLIP-based similarity scores, style transfer metrics) to complement human evaluation and verify the subjective findings
2. Generate multiple images per setting to assess consistency and examine how results vary with different base images and prompt formulations
3. Systematically test each proposed mechanism (prompt length, artist names, preprocessing) in isolation to confirm their individual contributions to the observed effects
