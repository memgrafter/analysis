# SynthEval: A Framework for Detailed Utility and Privacy Evaluation of Tabular Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.15821
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15821
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Novel open-source framework for comprehensive evaluation of tabular synthetic data using 18+12 metrics for utility and privacy assessment

## Executive Summary
SynthEval addresses the critical need for robust evaluation of tabular synthetic data by providing a comprehensive framework that treats categorical and numerical attributes equally without requiring preprocessing steps. The framework distinguishes itself through its ability to handle heterogeneous data types seamlessly while integrating both statistical and machine learning-based evaluation metrics. By supporting independent metric usage or highly customizable benchmark configurations, SynthEval enables researchers and practitioners to perform thorough assessments of synthetic data fidelity and privacy integrity across diverse applications.

## Method Summary
SynthEval implements a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates 18 utility metrics and 12 privacy metrics using both statistical and machine learning techniques. The framework operates by accepting real and synthetic tabular datasets as input and computing various evaluation scores that assess data fidelity and privacy risks. A key innovation is the framework's special handling of heterogeneous data types, particularly through the use of Gower's distance for nearest neighbor calculations and adapted metrics that work equally well for categorical and numerical attributes. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing users to integrate custom metrics through a template system while providing built-in presets for quick evaluation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates superior performance in handling heterogeneous data compared to existing evaluation tools
- Successfully benchmarks multiple synthetic data generators across diverse datasets with varying attribute compositions
- Enables more consistent comparisons of model capabilities through standardized evaluation procedures
- Shows stability across various attribute mixtures without requiring data preprocessing or type-specific handling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its fundamental design principle of treating categorical and numerical attributes equally through metric adaptation rather than preprocessing. By using Gower's distance as the default metric for nearest neighbor calculations, SynthEval can handle mixed data types naturally without forcing artificial transformations. The integration of both statistical metrics (like correlation differences) and machine learning-based metrics (like propensity scores and membership inference) provides a comprehensive view of synthetic data quality. The framework's extensibility through custom metric templates allows it to evolve with emerging evaluation needs while maintaining consistency in handling heterogeneous data types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gower's distance**: A metric that can compute distances between observations with mixed numerical and categorical variables by using appropriate distance functions for each type and combining them with weights. Why needed: Essential for nearest neighbor calculations when dealing with heterogeneous tabular data without preprocessing. Quick check: Verify distance calculations on simple mixed-type datasets produce intuitive results.

- **Propensity score methods**: Statistical techniques that estimate the probability of an observation belonging to a particular group based on observed covariates. Why needed: Used to assess whether synthetic data preserves the underlying data distribution and relationships. Quick check: Test on datasets where the target variable is known to be predictable or unpredictable.

- **Membership inference attacks**: Privacy attacks that determine whether a specific data point was used in training a model by analyzing the model's behavior or outputs. Why needed: Critical for evaluating whether synthetic data generation preserves privacy or leaks information about training data. Quick check: Validate on synthetic data known to contain or exclude specific training instances.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data input -> Metric computation modules -> Results aggregation -> Visualization/Reporting

**Critical path**: The framework follows a pipeline where real and synthetic datasets are first validated and prepared, then passed through various metric computation modules (utility and privacy), with results aggregated into comprehensive reports. The critical path involves the nearest neighbor calculations, which serve as building blocks for multiple metrics including privacy and some utility measures.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes generality and extensibility over specialized optimization for specific data types or use cases. By avoiding preprocessing assumptions and treating all attributes equally, it sacrifices some potential performance gains that could be achieved through type-specific optimizations. The choice to implement both statistical and ML-based metrics increases computational overhead but provides more comprehensive evaluation coverage.

**Failure signatures**: Inconsistent metric results across datasets with different attribute type distributions, unexpected high privacy metric values indicating potential data leakage, and computational timeouts on large datasets. The framework may also produce misleading results if the synthetic data size is too small relative to the real data for nearest neighbor calculations.

**Three first experiments**:
1. Run the "fast eval" preset on a simple synthetic dataset with known properties to verify basic functionality
2. Test metric computation on a mixed-type dataset with controlled attribute distributions to validate heterogeneous data handling
3. Implement a custom metric following the template to verify the extensibility mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper itself does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but based on the content and methodology described, several important questions emerge regarding the framework's performance in edge cases and specialized scenarios.

## Limitations
- The framework's performance and computational efficiency with very high-dimensional data (100+ attributes) remains untested and could present scalability challenges
- Sensitivity of nearest neighbor calculations to hyperparameter choices across different data type mixtures has not been empirically analyzed
- The framework's behavior on severely imbalanced classification datasets, which could affect both utility and privacy metric reliability, has not been evaluated

## Confidence
**High confidence** in the framework's core design principles and implementation approach, particularly the equal treatment of categorical and numerical attributes. **Medium confidence** in practical implementation details and specific computational procedures, as the paper provides methodology but lacks detailed configuration information for benchmark results. **High confidence** in the extensibility claims based on the described custom metric integration template.

## Next Checks
1. Verify metric computation consistency across datasets with varying attribute type distributions by testing on benchmark datasets with known ground truth statistics
2. Validate privacy metric implementations by running membership inference attacks on synthetic datasets with known privacy vulnerabilities
3. Test framework extensibility by implementing and integrating a custom evaluation metric following the described template approach
