# Risks, Causes, and Mitigations of Widespread Deployments of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04643
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04643
- Authors: Md Nazmus Sakib; Md Athikul Islam; Royal Pathak; Md Mashrur Arifin

- This survey systematically identifies and analyzes risks, causes, and mitigation strategies for large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of risks, causes, and mitigation strategies associated with large language model deployments. Through systematic literature review following Kitchenham and Charters criteria, the study identifies seven major risk categories: privacy issues, adversarial attacks, ethical concerns, bias and fairness, environmental impacts, legal violations, and human life disruption. The research maps these risks to specific root causes including overfitting, model complexity, lack of awareness, testing flaws, evolving threats, weak policies, security vulnerabilities, and poor data quality. The survey then outlines mitigation techniques spanning robust model development, privacy-preserving methods, regulatory compliance, secure data handling, bias detection, interpretability tools, and parameter-efficient models.

## Method Summary
The survey employed a systematic literature review methodology using Google Scholar with keywords "LLMs", "large language models", "risk assessment", and "risk mitigation", filtering papers published 2000-2024 and excluding tutorials, presentations, comments, and keynotes. Quality assessment was conducted based on context retention, reporting clarity, and ethical considerations following Kitchenham and Charters criteria. The final analysis included 47 papers that met the quality standards. Data synthesis involved extracting and organizing findings on risks, causes, and mitigation strategies into categorized frameworks.

## Key Results
- Identified seven major risk categories for LLM deployments: privacy, adversarial attacks, ethical concerns, bias and fairness, environmental impacts, legal violations, and human life disruption
- Mapped risks to root causes including overfitting, model complexity, lack of awareness, testing flaws, evolving threats, weak policies, security vulnerabilities, and poor data quality
- Documented mitigation techniques spanning robust model development, privacy-preserving methods, regulatory compliance, secure data handling, bias detection, interpretability tools, and parameter-efficient models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's structured categorization of risks into privacy, adversarial attacks, ethical concerns, bias and fairness, environmental impacts, legal violations, and human life disruption enables systematic identification and mitigation of LLM deployment challenges.
- Mechanism: By organizing risks into distinct categories, the survey creates a framework that allows stakeholders to identify specific problem areas, trace root causes, and apply targeted mitigation strategies. This prevents the common pitfall of treating LLM risks as a monolithic problem.
- Core assumption: Different risk categories have distinct root causes and require different mitigation approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "categorizes risks into privacy issues, adversarial attacks, ethical concerns, bias and fairness, environmental impacts, legal violations, and human life disruption"
  - [section] "The survey begins by listing the major risks associated with specific LLMs, followed by identifying sub-risks through synthesized data"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors focus on specific risk areas but don't directly validate the categorization framework
- Break condition: If root causes overlap significantly across categories, the categorization becomes less useful for targeted mitigation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Identifying specific LLMs affected by each sub-risk enables more precise risk assessment and targeted mitigation strategies.
- Mechanism: By mapping which models are vulnerable to which risks, the survey allows organizations to understand their specific exposure and implement appropriate safeguards. For example, knowing that GPT-Neo is prone to memorizing training data while BERT models have embedding vulnerabilities leads to different mitigation approaches.
- Core assumption: Different LLM architectures have different vulnerability profiles that can be systematically identified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For each sub-risk, the survey identifies which LLMs are affected"
  - [section] "Models like BERT and RoBERTa have demonstrated these vulnerabilities" [regarding ethical concerns]
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss general risks but don't validate the model-specific mapping approach
- Break condition: If LLM architectures converge to similar vulnerability profiles, the model-specific approach loses value.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linking root causes to specific mitigation techniques creates actionable pathways from problem identification to solution implementation.
- Mechanism: The survey traces each risk back to its underlying cause (like overfitting, data quality issues, or policy gaps) and then maps these causes to specific mitigation strategies. This creates a decision tree that practitioners can follow.
- Core assumption: Root causes are identifiable and have known, implementable mitigation strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The following are the general causes behind the risks associated with LLMs" and "The following are the mitigation techniques for addressing the underlying risks"
  - [section] "Mitigation techniques include robust model development, privacy-preserving methods, regulatory compliance, secure data handling, bias detection, interpretability tools, and parameter-efficient models"
  - [corpus] Moderate - the corpus includes surveys on specific mitigations, supporting the existence of known solutions
- Break condition: If root causes are too complex or intertwined to be effectively addressed by known techniques.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Risk categorization and systematic mapping
  - Why needed here: The survey's effectiveness depends on understanding how to organize complex information into meaningful categories and map relationships between problems, causes, and solutions
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why separating privacy risks from bias risks might lead to more effective mitigation strategies?

- Concept: Model architecture vulnerabilities
  - Why needed here: Understanding why different LLM architectures (BERT, GPT, Llama, etc.) have different vulnerability profiles is crucial for interpreting the survey's findings
  - Quick check question: Why might a transformer-based model like BERT be more vulnerable to embedding attacks than a decoder-only model like GPT?

- Concept: Root cause analysis in AI systems
  - Why needed here: The survey's approach of tracing risks back to underlying causes requires understanding how to perform systematic root cause analysis in complex systems
  - Quick check question: How would you distinguish between a symptom of a problem and its root cause when analyzing LLM behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Literature Search -> Quality Assessment -> Risk Categorization -> Sub-risk Identification -> Root Cause Mapping -> Mitigation Strategy Documentation -> Synthesis and Analysis
- Critical path: Search → Filter → Extract → Categorize → Map → Synthesize → Analyze
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive coverage vs. depth of analysis; model-specific detail vs. generalizability; academic rigor vs. practical applicability
- Failure signatures: Incomplete risk coverage, misclassification of sub-risks, missing root cause connections, inadequate mitigation strategies, or synthesis errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the literature search and filtering system on a known subset of papers to verify it captures relevant risk discussions
  2. Validate the risk categorization framework by applying it to a small set of papers and checking for consistency
  3. Test the sub-risk identification process by having multiple reviewers identify sub-risks from the same papers and comparing results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does overfitting in LLMs directly contribute to privacy breaches, and can specific mechanisms be isolated to quantify this relationship?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how models that memorize training data excessively are prone to overfitting and can compromise user privacy, citing GPT-Neo as an example that retains significant amounts of training data, leading to repeated patterns and increased risk of privacy breaches.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the link between overfitting and privacy breaches, it does not provide a detailed quantitative analysis of how overfitting directly contributes to these breaches. Understanding the specific mechanisms and quantifying this relationship would require further empirical studies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies that isolate and quantify the mechanisms by which overfitting leads to privacy breaches, potentially through controlled experiments or detailed case studies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective mitigation strategies for adversarial attacks on LLMs, and how do they compare in terms of robustness and practicality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses adversarial attacks on LLMs, such as prompt injection and model theft, and mentions mitigation strategies like adversarial training and ensemble methods. However, it does not provide a comparative analysis of these strategies in terms of robustness and practicality.
- Why unresolved: While the paper outlines some mitigation strategies, it lacks a comparative analysis to determine which strategies are most effective and practical for real-world applications. Further research is needed to evaluate and compare these strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies or benchmarks that evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of different adversarial attack mitigation strategies in various scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can regulatory frameworks be designed to effectively address the ethical and privacy concerns associated with LLMs without stifling innovation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for robust regulatory compliance measures to address ethical and privacy concerns, but it does not provide specific guidelines or frameworks for achieving this balance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper emphasizes the importance of regulatory compliance, it does not offer concrete solutions or frameworks for designing regulations that protect user privacy and ethics while fostering innovation. This remains a complex challenge requiring further exploration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or policy analyses that demonstrate successful regulatory frameworks balancing privacy, ethics, and innovation in the context of LLMs.

## Limitations

- The survey's risk categorization framework has not been validated against real-world deployment incidents, making it unclear whether the identified categories capture all significant LLM risks.
- The model-specific risk mapping relies on academic literature that may underrepresent practical deployment scenarios and emerging vulnerabilities.
- The root cause analysis assumes linear relationships between identified causes and mitigation strategies, which may oversimplify complex, interdependent risk factors.

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the comprehensive literature review methodology and systematic categorization approach.
- **Medium confidence** in the completeness of risk identification, given potential publication bias toward documented rather than emerging risks.
- **Low confidence** in the practical effectiveness of recommended mitigation strategies without empirical validation in real deployment contexts.

## Next Checks

1. Compare the survey's risk categories against incident reports from major LLM deployments to identify gaps in the categorization framework.
2. Test the model-specific risk mapping by analyzing actual vulnerability data from deployed LLM instances across different organizations.
3. Validate the root cause-to-mitigation mapping by implementing recommended strategies in controlled environments and measuring their effectiveness against identified risk sources.
