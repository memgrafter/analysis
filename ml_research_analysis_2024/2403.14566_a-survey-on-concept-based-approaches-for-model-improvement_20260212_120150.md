# A survey on Concept-based Approaches For Model Improvement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14566
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Systematic review of concept-based approaches for improving deep neural network models through enhanced interpretability and generalization

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews concept-based approaches for improving deep neural network models by leveraging human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. The paper categorizes concept representations into non-hierarchical (concept activation vectors, prototypes) and hierarchical types (concept graphs, symbolic features), and reviews various discovery methods including post-hoc approaches like autoencoders and ante-hoc methods like saliency-based techniques. The survey also examines how these concepts can improve model interpretability and generalization, providing a framework for evaluating concept quality through metrics like completeness, correctness, fidelity, causality, and diversity.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes concept-based approaches into three main areas: concept representations (non-hierarchical like CAVs and prototypes, hierarchical like concept graphs), concept discovery methods (post-hoc like super-pixel and autoencoders, ante-hoc like saliency and slot-attention), and model improvement techniques (CBMs for interpretability, causality-based for generalization). The paper provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating concepts and discusses future directions and applications across various domains.

## Key Results
- Concept representations are categorized into non-hierarchical (CAV, prototypes) and hierarchical (concept graphs, symbolic features) types
- Concept discovery methods are classified as post-hoc (super-pixel based, autoencoders, causality based) and ante-hoc (saliency based, slot-attention based)
- Model improvement techniques aim for better interpretability (CBMs, neuro-symbolic reasoning) and better generalization (CAV based, causality based)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Concept-based approaches improve model interpretability by mapping internal activations to human-understandable concepts.
- Mechanism: The model learns intermediate concept representations that bridge raw input features and final predictions, making reasoning traceable.
- Core assumption: Human concepts align well with the model's learned internal features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These approaches explain the model's decisions in simple human understandable terms called Concepts."
  - [section 1] "Concepts are known to be the thinking ground of humans."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct supporting evidence found in neighbors.
- Break condition: If internal activations don't correlate with human concepts, the explanations become meaningless.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Concept-based methods enable model improvement through targeted interventions.
- Mechanism: By identifying which concepts drive predictions, we can modify or constrain concept usage to remove biases or improve generalization.
- Core assumption: Model performance is directly tied to its use of correct concepts rather than spurious correlations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.1.2] "These models typically remove bias or confounding factors and show accuracy improvement on poisoned datasets."
  - [section 5] Lists evaluation metrics including "Causality" and "Correctness/Soundness" for concepts.
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors don't provide direct evidence of improvement mechanisms.
- Break condition: If concept interventions don't correlate with performance changes, the improvement mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Concept representations enable hierarchical reasoning that mimics human cognitive structures.
- Mechanism: Hierarchical concept graphs allow models to build reasoning chains from basic to complex concepts, enabling multi-step inference.
- Core assumption: Human reasoning follows hierarchical concept structures that can be captured in model architecture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Kori et al. [60] use concept graphs where the nodes are the concepts and edges depict relationships between them."
  - [section 6.4] "CODL leverages a common or background knowledge base, such as Microsoft Concept Graph, for the framework of conceptual understanding."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors don't address hierarchical reasoning mechanisms.
- Break condition: If concept hierarchies don't improve reasoning quality, the hierarchical approach provides no benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear algebra and vector spaces
  - Why needed here: Understanding concept activation vectors (CAVs) requires grasping how vectors represent directions in activation space
  - Quick check question: Can you explain what it means for a CAV to be "the normal to the boundary" in activation space?

- Concept: Neural network architecture basics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how concepts integrate with different model components (bottlenecks, reasoning modules)
  - Quick check question: How would you modify a standard CNN to include concept bottleneck layers?

- Concept: Causality vs correlation
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between models that merely correlate with concepts vs actually using them causally for decisions
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between TCAV scores and CaCE (causal concept effect) measures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Feature extractor → Concept representation layer → Reasoning module → Output. Multiple concept discovery methods can be inserted at different stages.
- Critical path: Concept representation → Concept evaluation → Model improvement interventions. Each stage depends on the previous one.
- Design tradeoffs: Post-hoc vs ante-hoc concept discovery (flexibility vs integration), supervised vs unsupervised concept learning (accuracy vs generality), hierarchical vs flat concept structures (reasoning depth vs simplicity).
- Failure signatures: Low fidelity scores, poor concept completeness, concept interventions not improving model performance, concepts not generalizing across datasets.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement CAV-based concept discovery on a simple CNN and visualize concept directions in activation space
  2. Add concept bottleneck layers to a pre-trained model and measure interpretability gains vs accuracy loss
  3. Test concept intervention effectiveness by modifying concept activations and observing prediction changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the most effective method for discovering unknown biases in deep neural networks that post-hoc concept-based explanations might miss?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that post-hoc explanations require no model architecture changes but are ineffective for detecting unknown biases in the system.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions this limitation, it does not propose or evaluate alternative methods for automatic bias detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the effectiveness of different concept-based approaches (post-hoc vs. ante-hoc) in detecting various types of unknown biases in diverse datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the robustness of concept-based models to adversarial perturbations be further improved beyond the proposed training for defense against such attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that concept-based models are prone to adversarial perturbations and proposes training for defense against such attacks.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the vulnerability but does not explore other potential solutions or the limitations of the proposed defense mechanism.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed defense against a wide range of adversarial attacks and comparisons with other defense strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the trade-offs between different concept representations (e.g., concept activation vectors, prototypes, neuro-symbolic) in terms of interpretability, computational efficiency, and model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides a comprehensive review of various concept representations but does not directly compare their strengths and weaknesses.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the characteristics of each representation, it does not quantify or compare their performance across different tasks and datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of multiple concept representations on a diverse set of tasks, measuring interpretability, computational cost, and impact on model accuracy.

## Limitations
- Uncertainty about whether discovered concepts truly align with human understanding versus being statistical artifacts
- Scalability concerns for concept-based methods to complex real-world tasks
- Limited application of current approaches to domains beyond visual data

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The categorization framework for concept representations (non-hierarchical vs hierarchical) and discovery methods (post-hoc vs ante-hoc) is well-established and clearly defined.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claimed benefits of concept-based approaches for interpretability and generalization are supported by literature, but empirical evidence varies across studies.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about hierarchical reasoning improvements and cross-domain applicability lack sufficient empirical validation in the surveyed works.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the same concept-based improvement pipeline across multiple diverse datasets (visual, text, tabular) to test generalizability claims.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing concept-based models with traditional black-box models on both interpretability metrics and performance measures.
3. Perform human studies to validate whether discovered concepts align with human mental models and improve trust in model decisions.
