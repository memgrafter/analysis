- This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models of event comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehension theories to contemporary event cognition frameworks.

## Executive Summary
This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models of event comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehension theories to contemporary event cognition frameworks. The review covers key discourse comprehension accounts, including Construction-Integration, Event Indexing, Causal Network, and Resonance models, highlighting their contributions to understanding cognitive processes in comprehension. I then discuss contemporary theoretical frameworks of event comprehension, including Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007), the Event Horizon Model (Radvansky & Zacks, 2014), and Hierarchical Generative Framework (Kuperberg, 2021), which emphasize prediction, causality, and multilevel representations in event understanding. Building on these theories, I evaluate five computational models of event comprehension: REPRISE (Butz et al., 2019), Structured Event Memory (SEM; Franklin et al., 2020), the Lu model (Lu et al., 2022), the Gumbsch model (Gumbsch et al., 2022), and the Elman and McRae model (2019). The analysis focuses on their approaches to hierarchical processing, prediction mechanisms, and representation learning. Key themes that emerge include the use of hierarchical structures as inductive biases, the importance of prediction in comprehension, and diverse strategies for learning event dynamics. The review identifies critical areas for future research, including the need for more sophisticated approaches to learning structured representations, integrating episodic memory mechanisms, and developing adaptive updating algorithms for working event models.

## Method Summary
This review employs a theoretical analysis approach, synthesizing computational models of event comprehension through a systematic examination of five selected models (REPRISE, SEM, Lu model, Gumbsch model, Elman and McRae model). The methodology involves applying a placeholder framework that maps online comprehension processes, two-step prediction/updating operations, and schema learning mechanisms to each model. The analysis focuses on how these models address key mechanistic questions from event comprehension theories, including hierarchical structure, information flow, event schema learning, updating mechanisms, and integration with memory systems. Rather than empirical testing, the review provides a conceptual comparison of architectural assumptions and computational approaches.

## Key Results
- Hierarchical structures serve as inductive biases that enable more stable and predictive event models
- Prediction errors drive updates to event models, enabling adaptation to unexpected changes
- Gating mechanisms control information flow to maintain stable event models during normal processing while allowing updates during transitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical structures serve as inductive biases that enable more stable and predictive event models.
- Mechanism: Multiple levels of representation compress information from lower to higher levels, allowing smoother changes at abstract levels and facilitating prediction of future states.
- Core assumption: The environment has hierarchical structure that can be exploited for learning and prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Key themes that emerge include the use of hierarchical structures as inductive biases"
  - [section] "Hierarchical Structure...hierarchy is an inductive bias that modelers embed in their models"
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.4, average citations=0.2.
- Break condition: If environmental structure is non-hierarchical or the model cannot learn appropriate compression functions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prediction errors drive updates to event models, enabling adaptation to unexpected changes.
- Mechanism: When observed events deviate from predictions, errors propagate upward through the hierarchy to revise latent states and update the current event model.
- Core assumption: Prediction errors signal when the current event model is no longer accurate and needs revision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the importance of prediction in comprehension"
  - [section] "prediction error," the difference between our anticipations and actual occurrences. When this error spikes, it indicates that our current working model is no longer sufficiently accurate, triggering an update.
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.4, average citations=0.2.
- Break condition: If prediction errors are not properly computed or propagated, or if the model becomes insensitive to errors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gating mechanisms control information flow to maintain stable event models during normal processing while allowing updates during transitions.
- Mechanism: Sensory information is gated based on prediction error magnitude or uncertainty, opening during high-error periods (e.g., event boundaries) and remaining closed during stable periods.
- Core assumption: Event models need to be stable most of the time but must update during significant changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "gating mechanism that controls the stability and updating of the hidden layer vector" (Gumbsch model)
  - [section] "sensory information is gated by a learnable module (GateL0RD)" (Gumbsch model)
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.4, average citations=0.2.
- Break condition: If gating is too restrictive (preventing necessary updates) or too permissive (destabilizing models).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical representation learning
  - Why needed here: Event comprehension requires processing at multiple levels of abstraction, from sensory details to event schemas
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how information flows between levels in a hierarchical model?

- Concept: Prediction error-based learning
  - Why needed here: The system must detect when its current model is inaccurate and needs updating
  - Quick check question: What happens when prediction error exceeds a threshold in the Gumbsch model?

- Concept: Event segmentation and boundary detection
  - Why needed here: The system must identify when one event ends and another begins to update event models appropriately
  - Quick check question: How does the Gumbsch model identify end states of events?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Three-level hierarchy (scene, latent states, event types) with top-down predictions, lateral dynamics, and gated bottom-up updates; memory systems for episodic retrieval; attentional control mechanisms.
- Critical path: Input sensory information → hierarchical processing → prediction generation → comparison with observations → error propagation → latent state updates → event model revision.
- Design tradeoffs: Tradeoff between model stability (keeping event models consistent) and adaptability (allowing updates when needed); tradeoff between shared dynamics across event types (efficiency) and separate dynamics (specificity).
- Failure signatures: High prediction errors without model updates indicate gating problems; failure to learn end states suggests inadequate error propagation; inability to segment events indicates poor boundary detection.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a two-level hierarchy with simple RNN and test prediction accuracy on sequences with clear event boundaries.
  2. Add gating mechanism based on prediction error magnitude and measure stability vs. adaptability tradeoff.
  3. Implement episodic memory retrieval and test its effect on prediction accuracy in scenarios with missing information.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can hierarchical structures in event comprehension models be learned non-parametrically rather than treated as fixed hyperparameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies this as a critical area for future research, stating "Is there a way to non-parametrically learn the number of hierarchical levels instead of treating it as a hyper-parameter?"
- Why unresolved: Current models use predefined hierarchical structures that may not adapt to the varying complexity of different events or discourses. The paper suggests that the shape of hierarchy should depend on the hierarchical structure of the environment, but doesn't provide solutions for how this could be implemented.
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational model that can dynamically adjust its hierarchical structure based on input complexity, along with empirical validation showing this approach outperforms fixed-hierarchy models in comprehension tasks across diverse event types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the mechanisms for learning end states of events in an unsupervised manner?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "learning end states is an important computational challenge in modeling event comprehension" and discusses two potential mechanisms: relying on shifts in working event models or using moments of degraded prediction quality.
- Why unresolved: While the Gumbsch model proposes one approach (relying on shifts in latent states), the alternative mechanism of using prediction quality degradation hasn't been tested in any model. The paper doesn't provide definitive evidence for which mechanism is more effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of models using different end-state detection mechanisms across various event types, demonstrating which approach more accurately identifies event boundaries and improves comprehension performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do elaborative inference and prediction interact during event comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "it's unclear how elaborative inference and prediction interact" and poses questions about whether inference before prediction helps accuracy or whether inference occurs only when prediction quality degrades.
- Why unresolved: The Elman and McRae model learns co-occurrence patterns for elaborative inference, but doesn't model the interaction with prediction. The paper suggests this is an important gap but doesn't provide evidence for how these processes should be integrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational model that successfully integrates elaborative inference and prediction mechanisms, validated through behavioral experiments showing improved comprehension when both processes are coordinated.

## Limitations
- The review relies on theoretical analysis rather than empirical validation of model performance
- The analysis depends heavily on architectural descriptions without access to actual implementations
- Quantitative performance metrics or experimental results demonstrating model capabilities are not included

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The importance of hierarchical structure and prediction in event comprehension is well-established across multiple theoretical frameworks.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about specific gating mechanisms and their implementation in computational models are supported by architectural descriptions but lack empirical validation.
- **Low confidence**: The review does not provide sufficient detail on how models handle complex scenarios involving multiple interacting events or long-term dependencies.

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation Verification**: Obtain and run the actual code for at least two of the reviewed computational models to verify that their stated mechanisms (hierarchical processing, prediction, gating) function as described.
2. **Empirical Validation**: Design experiments to test whether prediction errors and hierarchical representations in these models correlate with human comprehension patterns during event processing tasks.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Systematically compare model performance on standardized event comprehension benchmarks to evaluate which architectural features most strongly predict successful event understanding.
