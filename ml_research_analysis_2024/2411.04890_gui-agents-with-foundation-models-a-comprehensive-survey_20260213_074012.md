## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of GUI agents powered by foundation models, particularly (M)LLMs, which can autonomously execute user instructions by interpreting and interacting with graphical user interfaces. The paper presents a unified framework consisting of five components - GUI Perceiver, Task Planner, Decision Maker, Memory Retriever, and Executor - and classifies existing approaches based on input modality and learning mode. The survey covers recent advancements in data resources, frameworks, and applications while highlighting key challenges including personalization, security, and inference efficiency.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on GUI agents built on foundation models through a comprehensive review of recent advancements in datasets, frameworks, and applications. The authors propose a generalized framework with five components for GUI agent development and classify existing work based on input modality (vision, text, behavior traces) and learning mode (prompting-based vs. SFT-based). The survey evaluates different approaches through case studies of industrial applications like Google Assistant, Apple Intelligence, and OpenAI Operator, while identifying open challenges and future research directions in the field.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integration of (M)LLMs into GUI agents significantly enhances their ability to understand and execute complex user instructions by leveraging multimodal processing capabilities.
- Mechanism: (M)LLMs process both visual (GUI screenshots) and textual (user instructions) inputs, enabling the agent to ground instructions in the current UI context. This allows for more accurate task planning and execution compared to unimodal models.
- Core assumption: The visual and textual modalities are semantically aligned and can be jointly processed to infer user intent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By leveraging the ability of (M)LLMs to process and interpret Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), these agents can autonomously execute user instructions, simulating human-like interactions such as clicking and typing."
  - [section 3.1] "UI perception is also an important problem in GUI agent research, some work [You et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024b] focuses on understanding and processing UIs, rather than building the agent."
- Break condition: If the GUI contains elements that are not visually distinguishable or if the instructions are ambiguous and not well grounded in the UI context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of a unified framework with distinct components allows for modular development and optimization of GUI agents.
- Mechanism: Each component specializes in a specific function, enabling targeted improvements and easier debugging. For example, the GUI Perceiver can be optimized for better UI understanding, while the Task Planner can be enhanced for more effective task decomposition.
- Core assumption: The separation of concerns into distinct components does not introduce significant overhead or communication delays between components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "We present a generalized (M)LLM-based GUI agent framework, consisting of five components: GUI Perceiver, Task Planner, Decision Maker, Memory Retriever, and Executor."
  - [section 3.2] "Consequently, this paper classifies existing work with the difference of input modality and learning mode in Figure 3."
- Break condition: If the communication overhead between components becomes a bottleneck or if the modular design introduces inconsistencies in the agent's behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning (M)LLMs on GUI-specific datasets significantly improves their performance in GUI understanding and interaction compared to zero-shot prompting.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained model to the specific domain of GUIs, allowing it to learn relevant features and patterns for UI understanding and task execution. This results in better accuracy and efficiency compared to relying solely on the general knowledge.
- Core assumption: The GUI-specific datasets are representative of the target application domain and contain sufficient diversity to generalize well.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "SFT-based GUI Agents: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) allows (M)LLMs to adapt to specific domains and perform customized tasks with high efficiency."
  - [section 2] "Most of the aforementioned datasets are primarily limited to English and image-based tasks. However, UGIF Dataset [Venkatesh et al., 2024] covers eight languages, Mobile3M [Wu et al., 2024 ] focuses on Chinese, and GUI-WORLD [Chen et al. , 2024a ] includes video annotations, expanding the dataset landscape for broader multilingual and multimodal research."
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning process overfits to the training data or if the target domain significantly differs from the data used for fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: GUI agents need to process both visual (screenshots) and textual (instructions) inputs to understand and execute user commands.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between single-modal and multimodal learning, and why multimodal learning is important for GUI agents?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: Reinforcement learning can be used to train GUI agents to learn optimal policies for task execution through trial and error, potentially improving their efficiency and adaptability.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a reinforcement learning system, and how can they be applied to training GUI agents?

- Concept: Computer vision
  - Why needed here: GUI agents rely on computer vision techniques to understand and interpret the visual information in GUI screenshots, such as identifying UI elements and their functions.
  - Quick check question: What are some common computer vision tasks used in GUI understanding, and how do they contribute to the overall performance of a GUI agent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GUI Perceiver -> Task Planner -> Decision Maker -> Executor -> Device action
- Critical path: User instruction → GUI Perceiver → Task Planner → Decision Maker → Executor → Device action
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. speed: More complex models may achieve higher accuracy but at the cost of increased inference time.
  - Generalization vs. specialization: Fine-tuning on specific datasets may improve performance on target tasks but may reduce the agent's ability to generalize to new domains.
  - Modularity vs. integration: A modular design allows for easier development and debugging but may introduce communication overhead between components.
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect UI understanding: The agent misinterprets the GUI layout or the function of UI elements.
  - Inaccurate task planning: The agent decomposes the user instruction into incorrect or inefficient steps.
  - Suboptimal action selection: The agent chooses actions that do not lead to the desired outcome or take an unnecessarily long path.
  - Device incompatibility: The agent's actions are not compatible with the target device or application.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the GUI Perceiver's ability to accurately identify UI elements and their functions on a variety of GUI screenshots.
  2. Evaluate the Task Planner's performance in decomposing complex user instructions into actionable steps on a benchmark dataset.
  3. Assess the Decision Maker's ability to select optimal actions based on the current UI state and task plan in a simulated environment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can personalized GUI agents effectively collect and utilize user-specific information (e.g., routines, preferences) to enhance task automation while respecting privacy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "Personalized GUI Agents" as a key challenge, noting that integrating personalized information could significantly enhance user experience but requires effective collection and utilization methods.
- Why unresolved: Balancing personalization with privacy concerns is complex, and there is no clear framework for safely collecting and using sensitive user data in GUI agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of privacy-preserving methods (e.g., federated learning, on-device processing) that demonstrate improved task performance without compromising user privacy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies to ensure the security of GUI agents, particularly in high-stakes environments like financial or social media applications, while maintaining transparency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights "Security of GUI Agents" as a critical challenge, emphasizing the need for agents to be secure, generalizable, and transparent in their actions.
- Why unresolved: Ensuring security without sacrificing usability or transparency is difficult, and current methods may not adequately address the risks of improper operations in sensitive applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of robust security protocols and transparency mechanisms (e.g., audit trails, user verification) that prevent malicious actions and are validated through real-world testing.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can inference efficiency be improved for (M)LLM-based GUI agents to reduce latency and enable seamless device-cloud collaboration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "Inference Efficiency" as a key challenge, noting that current agents face significant latency issues and that efficient device-cloud strategies are critical for real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: Optimizing inference speed while maintaining accuracy and enabling efficient device-cloud collaboration requires advancements in both hardware and algorithmic approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of reduced inference latency through techniques like model compression, edge computing, or optimized collaboration strategies, validated by measurable improvements in response times.
