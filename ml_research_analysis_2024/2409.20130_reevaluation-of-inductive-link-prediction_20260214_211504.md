core_contribution: Current inductive link prediction evaluation protocols rely on
  ranking true entities within small randomly sampled negative sets, which inflates
  performance scores and fails to measure true predictive ability. The authors show
  that a simple rule-based baseline exploiting entity type validity outperforms state-of-the-art
  models under this protocol, indicating the evaluation itself is flawed.

# Reevaluation of Inductive Link Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.20130
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20130
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** Current inductive link prediction evaluation protocols inflate performance scores through unrealistic negative sampling, with type-matching proposed as a more realistic alternative.

## Executive Summary
Current inductive link prediction evaluation protocols rely on ranking true entities within small randomly sampled negative sets, which artificially inflates performance scores and fails to measure true predictive ability. The authors demonstrate that a simple rule-based baseline exploiting entity type validity can outperform state-of-the-art models under this protocol, revealing fundamental flaws in the evaluation methodology. They propose a more realistic evaluation using full-entity rankings or type-matched negative sampling, which dramatically changes the performance ranking of methods. Under the corrected evaluation, graph neural network approaches like NBFNet, AStarNet, and RED-GNN lead, while NodePiece and GraIL-based models drop in rank.

## Method Summary
The authors identify that current inductive link prediction benchmarks use unrealistic negative sampling by ranking true entities against small sets of randomly sampled negatives. They propose type-matched negative sampling where candidates share the same entity type as the true answer, arguing this better reflects real-world constraints. They evaluate multiple baselines including a simple type-based rule and several state-of-the-art models across standard datasets, comparing performance under both random and type-matched evaluation protocols. The key insight is that the original protocol allows models to achieve high scores by learning simple type patterns rather than genuine link prediction capability.

## Key Results
- A simple rule-based baseline exploiting type validity outperforms sophisticated models under current evaluation protocols
- Type-matched negative sampling dramatically changes the performance ranking of methods
- Graph neural network approaches (NBFNet, AStarNet, RED-GNN) lead under the corrected evaluation
- NodePiece and GraIL-based models drop significantly in rank when evaluated with type-matched negatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The inflated scores in current evaluation protocols occur because models can exploit the unrealistic negative sampling strategy. When true entities are ranked against only a handful of random negatives, models can achieve high performance by learning simple heuristics like type compatibility rather than complex relational patterns. The proposed type-matched negative sampling creates a more challenging evaluation by ensuring negative candidates are type-valid, forcing models to distinguish between genuinely related entities rather than simply filtering by type.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inductive link prediction:** Predicting links for entities unseen during training; needed to understand the specific challenge being addressed, quick check: can you explain how this differs from transductive link prediction?
- **Negative sampling in ranking tasks:** The process of selecting negative examples for evaluation; needed to understand why current protocols are flawed, quick check: what's the difference between random and type-matched negative sampling?
- **Entity typing in knowledge graphs:** Assigning types to entities to constrain valid relations; needed to understand the baseline approach, quick check: how does type information constrain valid link predictions?
- **Knowledge graph completion benchmarks:** Standard evaluation protocols and datasets; needed to contextualize the findings, quick check: what are the typical negative sampling strategies used in current benchmarks?
- **Graph neural networks for link prediction:** Neural architectures designed to operate on graph-structured data; needed to understand the state-of-the-art approaches being evaluated, quick check: how do GNNs differ from embedding-based approaches for link prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Datasets -> Preprocessing (type extraction) -> Evaluation Protocol (random vs type-matched) -> Models (rule-based, GNNs, embedding methods) -> Performance metrics
- **Critical path:** Data preparation and evaluation protocol selection determine the difficulty of the task, which in turn determines which model architectures can succeed
- **Design tradeoffs:** Random negative sampling enables easier evaluation and higher scores but less realistic assessment; type-matched sampling provides realistic evaluation but may introduce type information leakage
- **Failure signatures:** Models that perform well under random sampling but poorly under type-matched sampling likely exploit type heuristics rather than learning genuine link patterns
- **3 first experiments:** 1) Reproduce the type-based baseline performance under current protocols, 2) Evaluate the same baseline under type-matched sampling, 3) Compare state-of-the-art model rankings between evaluation protocols

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings are based on specific datasets and may not generalize across all inductive link prediction scenarios
- Type-matched negative sampling may introduce new biases if type information is not uniformly available
- The proposed evaluation still may not perfectly reflect real-world deployment scenarios with multiple constraint factors

## Confidence
- **High:** Current evaluation protocols inflate performance scores, demonstrated by simple rule-based baseline outperforming sophisticated models
- **Medium:** Type-matched negative sampling provides more realistic evaluation, though practical implementation across diverse datasets may reveal challenges

## Next Checks
1. Apply type-matched negative sampling to additional benchmark datasets across different domains to verify consistent performance ranking changes
2. Conduct ablation studies on the rule-based baseline to determine which aspects of type compatibility drive its performance
3. Evaluate whether incorporating type information as a post-filtering constraint yields different performance characteristics than negative sampling approaches
