# ReGenesis: LLMs can Grow into Reasoning Generalists via Self-Improvement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02108
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02108
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ReGenesis achieves 7.1%-18.9% gains on in-domain tasks and 6.1% improvement on out-of-domain tasks

## Executive Summary
ReGenesis introduces a method for improving large language models' reasoning abilities through self-synthesized reasoning paths without additional supervision. The approach progresses from abstract reasoning guidelines to concrete task-specific paths, generating diverse reasoning structures that avoid the task-specific limitations of existing methods. Experiments demonstrate that ReGenesis achieves significant improvements on both in-domain tasks (7.1%-18.9% gains across five tasks) and out-of-domain tasks (6.1% improvement versus 4.6% average decline for baseline methods), effectively transforming LLMs into reasoning generalists through self-improvement.

## Method Summary
ReGenesis employs a three-stage process to generate reasoning paths: guidance adaptation (converting 25 abstract seed guidelines to task-specific ones), reasoning structure generation (creating concrete frameworks), and reasoning path generation (producing complete solutions). The method uses ground truth answers only for filtering incorrect paths, not for generation, and fine-tunes the model on the filtered reasoning paths. This approach avoids the task-specific limitations of existing methods by creating diverse, general reasoning structures that can transfer to out-of-domain tasks.

## Key Results
- In-domain performance: 7.1%-18.9% gains across five tasks (GSM8K, NumGLUE, ARC-c, ReClor, StrategyQA)
- Out-of-domain performance: 6.1% improvement versus 4.6% average decline for baseline methods
- A+S (Answers only for filtering, no hints) approach outperformed A+S+P (Answers with hints) on in-domain and 5 out of 6 OOD tests
- The method works with both Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 and Llama-3 8B models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Progressing from abstract to concrete reasoning structures generates more diverse and generalizable reasoning paths compared to task-specific approaches
- Mechanism: By first creating general task-agnostic reasoning guidelines, then adapting them to specific tasks, and finally generating reasoning structures before complete solutions, the method forces the model to consider multiple cognitive strategies rather than following rigid task-specific patterns
- Core assumption: Diverse reasoning structures lead to better generalization across out-of-domain tasks than uniform chain-of-thought approaches
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ReGenesis adopts a methodological approach that transitions from abstract and general reasoning guidelines to concrete and specific reasoning solutions"
  - [section 4.3.2]: "ReGenesis does not restrict the self-synthesized reasoning paths with task-specific patterns or human-designed CoT examples, leading to performance improvement in almost all OOD scenarios tested"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using ground truth only for filtering (not for generating reasoning paths) improves reasoning path quality
- Mechanism: Filtering incorrect reasoning paths with ground truth answers ensures only valid reasoning trajectories are used for fine-tuning, while keeping hints separate prevents the model from simply reverse-engineering answers
- Core assumption: Reasoning paths generated without answer hints contain more genuine reasoning steps than those generated with hints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3]: "the A+S approach outperformed A+S+P, showing better results on in-domain tests and 5 out of 6 OOD tests"
  - [abstract]: "we use the given ground-truth answers to filter out those reasoning solutions that are incorrect"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple diverse reasoning guidelines per instruction generate more robust reasoning patterns
- Mechanism: Using 25 different seed reasoning guidelines and generating reasoning paths for each creates a diverse dataset that captures multiple problem-solving approaches rather than a single rigid pattern
- Core assumption: Exposure to multiple reasoning approaches during training enables better adaptation to unseen problems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.5]: "Different language models vary in their preference for guidelines when self-synthesizing reasoning paths"
  - [abstract]: "ReGenesis uses a given LLM to self-synthesize reasoning paths by progressing from abstract to concrete"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-consistency in reasoning paths
  - Why needed here: The method uses majority vote filtering as an alternative when ground truth isn't available, requiring understanding of how self-consistency identifies correct reasoning
  - Quick check question: How does self-consistency determine which reasoning path is correct when multiple paths exist?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: The method builds on CoT approaches but extends them with more structured reasoning path generation
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes ReGenesis's reasoning structure generation from standard chain-of-thought prompting?

- Concept: Out-of-domain generalization
  - Why needed here: The key contribution is improving OOD performance, requiring understanding of what makes reasoning generalizable
  - Quick check question: Why do task-specific reasoning paths typically fail to generalize to out-of-domain problems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Seed reasoning guideline generator (25 general prompts) -> Guidance adaptation module (task-specific tailoring) -> Reasoning structure generator (concrete framework creation) -> Reasoning path generator (complete solution generation) -> Filtering system (ground truth validation) -> Fine-tuning pipeline (model improvement)

- Critical path: Seed prompt → Guidance adaptation → Reasoning structure → Reasoning path → Filtering → Fine-tuning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More guidelines increase diversity but computational cost
  - Stricter filtering improves quality but reduces dataset size
  - Including hints improves path generation but may reduce reasoning quality

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degrades on OOD tasks (overfitting to specific patterns)
  - Low utilization of training data (few correct reasoning paths)
  - Inconsistent improvements across different reasoning types

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with 5 vs 25 seed guidelines to measure diversity impact
  2. Compare filtering with vs without ground truth hints
  3. Measure OOD performance when training on single vs multiple datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific reasoning strategies or cognitive modules are most effective for improving LLM reasoning performance on different task types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions Zhou et al. (2024) developed techniques for LLMs to select and combine simple reasoning modules like critical thinking and step-by-step analysis, which inspired ReGenesis to generate diverse reasoning paths
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't analyze which specific reasoning strategies in their general guidelines are most effective for different task types, nor does it compare the effectiveness of different combinations of reasoning modules
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies testing individual reasoning strategies and their combinations across different task types, measuring which strategies contribute most to performance improvements

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the diversity of self-synthesized reasoning paths affect the model's ability to generalize to out-of-domain tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper hypothesizes that existing methods fail to generalize because their reasoning paths are too task-specific, but doesn't empirically measure the relationship between path diversity and OOD generalization
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that ReGenesis outperforms baselines on OOD tasks but doesn't quantify how path diversity metrics correlate with generalization performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring path diversity metrics (e.g., structural variation, vocabulary diversity) and correlating these with OOD performance across different training configurations

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can filtered-out reasoning paths that lead to incorrect answers still contribute to model improvement?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 mentions future work to explore leveraging filtered-out reasoning paths to further enhance language model performance
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses correct reasoning paths for fine-tuning and filters out incorrect ones without investigating whether these could still be useful for training
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing fine-tuning with only correct paths versus including filtered-out paths with error correction mechanisms or contrastive learning approaches

## Limitations
- Performance gains are task-dependent, with stronger results on GSM8K (18.9% gain) than ARC-c (7.1% gain)
- Computational cost increases with the need to generate multiple reasoning paths per instruction
- Dependency on ground truth answers for filtering may limit applicability to domains without clear correct answers

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core claim that ReGenesis improves in-domain performance compared to baseline methods is well-supported with multiple datasets showing consistent gains (7.1%-18.9% improvements across five tasks)
- Medium Confidence: The claim that ReGenesis generalizes better to out-of-domain tasks is supported by the 6.1% average improvement versus 4.6% average decline for baselines, though this relies on specific test sets and may not generalize to all OOD scenarios
- Medium Confidence: The assertion that abstract-to-concrete progression generates more diverse reasoning structures is supported by qualitative observations but lacks direct quantitative comparison of diversity metrics between ReGenesis and task-specific approaches

## Next Checks
1. Measure the actual diversity of reasoning paths generated by ReGenesis versus task-specific methods using established diversity metrics (e.g., edit distance between reasoning paths, clustering analysis of path structures) to empirically validate the abstract-to-concrete mechanism's effectiveness

2. Remove the guidance adaptation step to test whether the abstract-to-concrete progression is essential for performance gains, or if simpler approaches could achieve similar results with less computational overhead

3. Evaluate ReGenesis on a larger reasoning model (e.g., Llama-3 70B) and on datasets requiring longer reasoning chains to determine if the approach scales effectively with model size and task complexity
