# H2G2-Net: A Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Generative Network Framework for Discovery of Multi-Modal Physiological Responses

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.02905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02905
- Reference count: 5
- Key outcome: Outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs by 5%-20% in classification accuracy of pilot training program difficulty levels

## Executive Summary
H2G2-Net addresses the challenge of discovering human cognitive and emotional states from multi-modal physiological signals by leveraging their inherent hierarchical heterogeneous structure. The framework automatically learns graph structures without domain knowledge through trainable edge weights, capturing both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships across two processing levels. Extensive experiments on the CogPilot dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing graph neural networks for classifying pilot training program difficulty levels.

## Method Summary
The H2G2-Net framework processes multi-modal physiological data through a hierarchical architecture with sub-modality and modality levels. At the sub-modality level, GCN layers learn representations within each homogeneous modality (EMG, ECG, PPG, EDA, RES, ACC, GD, PD, EO). At the modality level, H2G2 layers with trainable adjacency matrices learn relationships between modalities by automatically discovering optimal graph structures. The model ends with fully-connected layers and softmax classification. Training uses leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on the CogPilot dataset with 20 subjects having complete modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieves 5%-20% higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art GNNs for pilot training difficulty levels
- Demonstrates effective automatic graph structure learning without requiring domain expertise
- Reveals interpretable meta-paths that show information flow patterns among physiological modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The H2G2-Net learns graph structure automatically without requiring domain knowledge by jointly optimizing edge weights in adjacency matrices.
- Mechanism: Each H2G2 layer learns a weighted adjacency matrix A = softmax(Φ) where Φ is a trainable weight matrix. This allows the model to discover which modality interactions are most important for prediction by assigning higher weights to informative connections.
- Core assumption: The softmax operation ensures normalized edge weights and the learned adjacency matrices represent meaningful information flows among modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "automatically learns a graph structure without domain knowledge"
  - [section] "Let H(l-1) ∈ Rm×d be the input feature matrix... then the operation of the l-th H2G2 layer... is defined as A = softmax(Φ)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on heterogeneous graph learning but don't explicitly validate automatic graph structure learning without domain knowledge

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-level hierarchical architecture captures both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships simultaneously.
- Mechanism: The sub-modality level applies GCNs to learn representations within each modality (intra-modality), then the modality level uses H2G2 layers to learn relationships between modalities (inter-modality). This hierarchical processing allows the model to first learn local patterns within each modality before combining them.
- Core assumption: Modalities can be meaningfully decomposed into homogeneous sub-modalities, and the order of processing (sub-modality first, then modality) is optimal for capturing hierarchical information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "two levels: modality and sub-modality, which can model the hierarchy and heterogeneity of the data simultaneously"
  - [section] "The modality level operates on a heterogeneous graph... The sub-modality level operates on multiple homogeneous graphs"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence; neighboring papers on hierarchical graph networks support the general concept but don't specifically validate this two-level approach for physiological data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic graph structures learned across multiple H2G2 layers identify significant meta-paths that reveal physiological information flow patterns.
- Mechanism: Each H2G2 layer learns a new adjacency matrix, creating a sequence of dynamic graph structures. The progression of these matrices shows how information flows evolve across layers, revealing important meta-paths like {EO} → {PPG} → {RES} that correspond to physiological responses during cognitive tasks.
- Core assumption: The sequence of learned adjacency matrices captures meaningful temporal evolution of information flows, and these meta-paths correspond to actual physiological mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the learned dynamic series of graph structures provides valuable insights on information flows among modalities"
  - [section] "We can see in Equation (3) that each H2G2 layer learns a new adjacency matrix and generates a new graph structure"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; while neighboring papers discuss dynamic graph learning, none specifically validate the interpretability of meta-path discovery in physiological contexts

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: GNNs are designed to operate on graph-structured data and can naturally capture the relationships between different physiological modalities and their sub-components.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how GCNs and traditional neural networks process data?

- Hierarchical Data Representation
  - Why needed here: Physiological signals have inherent hierarchical structure (modalities contain sub-modalities), and this structure contains important information about how different physiological systems interact.
  - Quick check question: Why might processing modalities at different levels of granularity improve model performance?

- Multi-modal Data Fusion
  - Why needed here: Cognitive states are reflected across multiple physiological systems simultaneously, so combining information from different modalities provides a more complete picture than any single modality alone.
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when trying to combine information from heterogeneous data sources?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw physiological signals (9 modalities) -> Sub-modality GCN layers -> Modality H2G2 layers -> Fully-connected layers -> Classification output

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess and normalize all physiological signals
  2. Apply GCNs to learn sub-modality representations within each modality
  3. Stack modality representations and apply H2G2 layers to learn inter-modality relationships
  4. Aggregate final representations and classify difficulty levels

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. learned graph structure: Using learned structure provides flexibility but requires more parameters and training data
  - Number of H2G2 layers: More layers capture longer meta-paths but increase computational cost and risk over-fitting
  - GCN vs. other GNN variants: GCNs are simpler but may miss some relational patterns that GAT or GIN could capture

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on LOSO validation indicates over-fitting to specific subjects
  - Learned adjacency matrices that are nearly uniform suggest the model isn't learning meaningful relationships
  - Sub-modality representations that don't improve when aggregated indicate the GCN layers aren't capturing intra-modality patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with fixed random graph structure instead of learned structure to establish baseline performance
  2. Train with only sub-modality level (no modality-level H2G2 layers) to measure contribution of hierarchical processing
  3. Train with different numbers of H2G2 layers (1, 2, 3) to find optimal meta-path length for this dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the H2G2-Net perform if combined with other state-of-the-art GNNs instead of just GCN?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "In the future, we will investigate the effectiveness of H2G2-Net combined with other state-of-the-art GNNs rather than GCN."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation only combines H2G2-Net with GCN, leaving potential performance improvements with other GNNs unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing H2G2-Net's performance when combined with various other GNNs (e.g., GAT, GraphSAGE) on the same datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the H2G2-Net framework be extended to handle dynamic multi-modal physiological data that changes over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current H2G2-Net focuses on static graph structures, but physiological data often has temporal dynamics that could be captured.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address how the model would handle time-varying graph structures or sequential data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing H2G2-Net on datasets with temporal components and comparing it to time-aware graph neural networks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the minimum amount of data required for H2G2-Net to effectively learn meaningful graph structures in multi-modal physiological datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a dataset with 35 subjects but doesn't explore how performance scales with dataset size.
- Why unresolved: No ablation studies or sensitivity analysis on dataset size or subject count are provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number of subjects or training samples to determine the minimum viable dataset size.

## Limitations

- Limited dataset size (20 subjects with complete modalities) raises concerns about generalizability and overfitting
- LOSO validation, while appropriate for personalized models, may not capture full generalization capability
- Lack of empirical validation that learned meta-paths correspond to actual physiological mechanisms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The hierarchical architecture design (modality and sub-modality levels) is well-specified and the mathematical formulation of H2G2 layers is clearly presented
- **Medium confidence**: The LOSO validation results showing performance improvements, though the limited dataset size and lack of comparison with alternative validation strategies reduce confidence
- **Low confidence**: The interpretability claims about learned meta-paths revealing physiological information flows, as there's no empirical validation that these structures correspond to actual biological mechanisms

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset size sensitivity**: Replicate the experiments with varying numbers of subjects (e.g., 10, 15, 20) to determine if the 5-20% improvement holds with smaller datasets, which would indicate the model isn't overfitting to the limited data
2. **Fixed vs. learned structure ablation**: Train the same architecture with randomly initialized fixed adjacency matrices instead of learned ones to quantify the actual contribution of automatic graph structure learning to the performance gains
3. **Physiological correlation analysis**: Compare the learned meta-paths with known physiological relationships (e.g., between PPG and ECG for heart rate estimation) to validate that the model is discovering meaningful biological connections rather than arbitrary optimization patterns
