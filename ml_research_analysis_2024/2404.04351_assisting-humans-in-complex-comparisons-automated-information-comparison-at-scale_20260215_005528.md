# Assisting humans in complex comparisons: automated information comparison at scale

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04351
- Reference count: 11
- Novel system enabling accurate, automated information comparison at scale across knowledge domains

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ASC²End, a novel system that enables accurate, automated information comparison at scale across knowledge domains. The system addresses scalability challenges in applying large language models for information comparisons by using abstractive summarization, retrieval augmented generation, and zero-shot prompting. ASC²End was evaluated on a news dataset and user-defined criteria, with models achieving desirable results in abstractive summarization using ROUGE scoring and comparison assessment using survey responses.

## Method Summary
ASC²End employs abstractive summarization to reduce document length while preserving semantic content, using 2000-token chunks summarized into 250-token segments. The system uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-specific information by performing semantic search on user-defined criteria. Zero-shot prompting directs LLM behavior for comparison tasks across domains without fine-tuning. The system processes documents through a pipeline of summarization, RAG retrieval, and comparison assessment to generate confidence scores for information comparisons.

## Key Results
- Models achieved desirable results in abstractive summarization using ROUGE scoring
- Comparison assessment quality validated through survey responses
- System demonstrated scalability with GPT-4 completing assessments in 0.38 minutes
- Enables efficient information comparison across large, complex datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Abstractive summarization enables information comparison at scale by reducing input length while preserving semantic content
- Mechanism: The system iteratively processes large documents in 2000-token chunks, generating 250-token summaries that retain key information while reducing context window pressure
- Core assumption: Abstractive summarization can preserve sufficient semantic content in summaries to support downstream comparison tasks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We utilize proven data-handling strategies such as abstractive summarization and retrieval augmented generation to overcome token limitations"
  - [section 3.1.2] "We preprocessed the obtained data by splitting each document into 2000 token chunks, with each chunk summarized into 250 token segments"
  - [section 4.1] "ROUGE scoring is widely used in many summarization-focused studies in involving generative LLMs as it provides a simple method of measuring the amount of information retained from the source text"
- Break condition: If semantic content loss during summarization exceeds threshold needed for accurate comparison, downstream comparison accuracy will degrade significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) provides context-specific information to support comparison assessment
- Mechanism: The system vectorizes user-defined criteria and performs semantic search to retrieve top-k passages relevant to document summaries, providing focused context for comparison
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity search can effectively retrieve relevant criteria passages for comparison against document content
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our system employs Semantic Text Similarity comparisons for generating evidence-supported analyses"
  - [section 3.2] "RAG retrieves relevant passages from the vector database by conducting a semantic search"
  - [section 5.1] "We addressed the QA limitations in RAG processes by incorporating an additional human-level LLM step to facilitate the comparison task instead of strictly using the RAG process for task completion"
- Break condition: If retrieved passages contain irrelevant information or miss critical criteria, comparison assessment accuracy will suffer

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot prompting enables flexible comparison assessment without model fine-tuning
- Mechanism: The system uses carefully crafted prompts with explicit guidelines, examples, and rules to direct LLM behavior for comparison tasks across domains
- Core assumption: Zero-shot prompting can effectively elicit desired comparison behavior from LLMs without domain-specific fine-tuning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Prompts were designed using zero-shot strategies to contextualize information for improved model reasoning"
  - [section 3.3] "To drive the outlined tasks in the CA module, a comparison prompt was provided to an LLM, as shown in Figure 4"
  - [section 3.4] "Zero-shot (Kojima et al., 2022) and few-shot (Wei et al., 2022) prompting techniques can be leveraged to direct answer structures and elicit human-like reasoning for response generation"
- Break condition: If prompt engineering fails to adequately direct LLM reasoning, comparison quality will be inconsistent or inaccurate

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic Text Similarity (STS)
  - Why needed here: Forms the basis for both RAG retrieval and comparison assessment
  - Quick check question: How does STS differ from lexical similarity and why is it more appropriate for document comparison?

- Concept: Abstractive vs Extractive Summarization
  - Why needed here: Abstractive summarization is used to reduce document length while maintaining semantic content
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between abstractive and extractive summarization in terms of information preservation?

- Concept: ROUGE Scoring
  - Why needed here: Used to evaluate summarization quality by measuring text overlap between summaries and source documents
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of ROUGE scoring for evaluating abstractive summarization quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document Summarization -> Criteria Embedding -> Retrieval Augmented Generation -> Comparison Assessment -> User Output
- Critical path: Raw document -> abstractive summarization -> RAG context -> comparison assessment -> confidence score
- Design tradeoffs: Token limitations vs information retention, model complexity vs runtime efficiency, zero-shot flexibility vs domain-specific accuracy
- Failure signatures: Low ROUGE scores indicate summarization quality issues; inconsistent comparison results indicate prompt engineering problems; slow runtime indicates computational resource constraints
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test summarization quality on sample documents using different chunk sizes and summary lengths
  2. Validate RAG retrieval accuracy with test criteria documents and document summaries
  3. Evaluate comparison assessment quality using survey participants with GPT-4 and Llama-2-70B models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the ASC²End system perform when scaling to much larger datasets beyond the 1253 articles tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that GPT-4 can complete a comparison assessment in 0.38 minutes, demonstrating scalability to larger datasets, but does not test with larger datasets
- Why unresolved: The current experiments only tested on a dataset of 1253 articles. The paper claims scalability but does not empirically validate performance on datasets significantly larger than this
- What evidence would resolve it: Running ASC²End on datasets with orders of magnitude more documents (e.g., tens of thousands or millions) and measuring performance metrics like processing time, accuracy, and resource utilization

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of ASC²End change when using different vector databases or embedding models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses FAISS as the vector database and BAAI's "bge-base-en-v1.5" as the embedding model, but does not compare these choices against alternatives
- Why unresolved: The selection of FAISS and the BAAI embedding model appears to be based on performance claims rather than direct comparison within the ASC²End framework
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking ASC²End using different combinations of vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma) and embedding models (e.g., OpenAI's embeddings, sentence-transformers) while measuring retrieval accuracy and system performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the RAG-to-comparison approach be further optimized to reduce the retrieval of irrelevant information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the similarity search sometimes returns irrelevant information due to imbalanced attention on the provided context, suggesting this is a limitation
- Why unresolved: The current approach retrieves passages based on relevance to the target topic rather than the candidate document summary, which can introduce noise
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing alternative retrieval strategies that prioritize context relevance, such as weighted similarity scoring or filtering mechanisms that evaluate the semantic alignment between retrieved passages and the document summary

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology relies heavily on subjective survey responses rather than comprehensive quantitative metrics
- Limited empirical validation of scalability claims beyond the 1253-article test dataset
- Zero-shot prompting approach may not generalize well across diverse domains without fine-tuning

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The system architecture combining abstractive summarization, RAG, and zero-shot prompting is technically sound and addresses known LLM token limitations
- **Medium Confidence:** The evaluation methodology provides initial validation but lacks comprehensive quantitative metrics for comparison assessment quality
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization across diverse knowledge domains remains unproven due to limited evaluation scope

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind comparison studies with domain experts across multiple industries to validate comparison assessment accuracy beyond the initial news dataset
2. Implement quantitative metrics for comparison quality assessment, such as information completeness scores and consistency measures across repeated evaluations
3. Test system performance with diverse document types and varying criteria complexity to evaluate scalability claims across knowledge domains
