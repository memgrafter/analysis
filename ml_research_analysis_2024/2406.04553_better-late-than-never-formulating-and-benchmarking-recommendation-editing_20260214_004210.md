# Better Late Than Never: Formulating and Benchmarking Recommendation Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04553
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes novel recommendation editing task with E-BPR baseline achieving up to 92.24% editing score

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the novel task of recommendation editing, which aims to modify trained recommendation models to remove unsuitable items without retraining or accessing training data. The authors propose a comprehensive framework with three primary objectives: strict rectification (editing explicit unsuitable items), collaborative rectification (editing similar unsuitable items), and concentrated rectification (avoiding unnecessary edits). They develop three evaluation metrics and present a simple yet effective baseline method using Editing Bayesian Personalized Ranking Loss (E-BPR).

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework for recommendation editing that modifies trained models using explicit editing pairs (user-item pairs where users have indicated dissatisfaction). The E-BPR loss treats explicit editing pairs as negative samples while preserving rankings of other items. The method can be applied to any trained recommendation model through embedding modification, making it model-agnostic. The framework includes three evaluation metrics: Editing Accuracy (EA) for strict rectification, Editing Collaboration (EC) for collaborative rectification, and Editing Prudence (EP) for concentrated rectification, with Editing Score (ES) as their harmonic mean.

## Key Results
- E-BPR achieves up to 92.24% editing score across various datasets and recommendation models
- The method demonstrates superior performance in editing unsuitable recommendations while preserving appropriate ones
- Benchmarking against existing methods shows the unique effectiveness of recommendation editing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: E-BPR loss effectively edits recommendations by treating explicit editing pairs as negative samples and maintaining rankings of other items.
- Mechanism: For each explicit editing pair (𝑢𝑒, 𝑖𝑒), the method generates top-k recommendations and applies BPR loss between 𝑖𝑒 and other items in the top-k list, pushing 𝑖𝑒 down in rankings while preserving other item positions.
- Core assumption: The top-k items for a user before editing remain relevant after editing, except for the removed unsuitable item.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present a straightforward yet effective benchmark for recommendation editing using novel Editing Bayesian Personalized Ranking Loss"
  - [section 4] "Our proposed E-BPR (Editing BPR) loss can be formalized as: L = ∑(𝑢𝑒,𝑖𝑒)∈EE ∑𝑗∈𝑅𝑢𝑒\{𝑖𝑒} -log(σ(𝑥𝑢𝑒,𝑗 - 𝑥𝑢𝑒,𝑖𝑒))"
- Break condition: If the unsuitable item was not originally in the top-k recommendations, this mechanism fails to address it since it only modifies items within the current recommendation set.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model editing through embedding modification preserves most recommendation quality while removing unsuitable items.
- Mechanism: The EFT method modifies final user and item embeddings directly without requiring knowledge of the original model's architecture, using gradients from the editing loss to update embeddings.
- Core assumption: User and item embeddings can be modified independently of the original model's architecture while maintaining overall recommendation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "To achieve the goal of model-agnostic recommendation editing, we propose to directly operate on user embedding P and item embedding Q"
  - [section 5.1.2] "In contrast, EFT modifies the final user and item embeddings through a model that generates these embeddings, without requiring detailed knowledge of the model's architecture"
- Break condition: If the original model uses complex non-linear transformations that depend on the original embeddings in ways that cannot be captured by simple embedding modifications.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The three-pronged evaluation framework ensures comprehensive assessment of recommendation editing effectiveness.
- Mechanism: Three metrics (EA, EC, EP) measure strict, collaborative, and concentrated rectification respectively, with ES as harmonic mean providing overall effectiveness score.
- Core assumption: These three aspects capture the essential dimensions of what makes recommendation editing successful in practice.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Based on the above properties, we propose a comprehensive evaluation approach to assess the effectiveness of the recommendation editing"
  - [section 3.2] "To measure the overall erroneous editing performance, note that the number of implicit and unnecessary editing pairs (EI and Ē) could be imbalanced, we propose Editing Score (ES), the harmonic mean between EC and EP"
- Break condition: If real-world scenarios require additional dimensions of evaluation not captured by these three metrics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
  - Why needed here: BPR forms the theoretical foundation for E-BPR loss by optimizing relative item rankings rather than absolute scores
  - Quick check question: How does BPR differ from traditional pointwise loss functions in recommendation systems?

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks for collaborative filtering
  - Why needed here: Understanding how graph-based models like LightGCN and XSimGCL differ from matrix factorization approaches is crucial for interpreting editing method performance differences
  - Quick check question: What advantage do graph-based models have over traditional matrix factorization in capturing collaborative signals?

- Concept: Model editing vs. model fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The distinction between modifying model parameters (fine-tuning) versus modifying embeddings (editing) is central to understanding EFT's approach
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences in resource requirements and privacy implications between model editing and traditional fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing: Load datasets, split into train/test, identify negative feedback as editing pairs
  - Base recommender: MF, LightGCN, or XSimGCL models trained on positive feedback
  - Editing methods: FT, EFT, LWF, L2, SRIU, RSR, SPMF, SML, SiReN, SiGRec, EGNN, BiEGNN
  - Evaluation pipeline: Compute EA, EC, EP, ES, Recall, and NDCG metrics

- Critical path: Dataset → Base model training → Editing pairs identification → Model editing → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs: Memory efficiency (EFT vs. FT), editing accuracy vs. prudence (regularization vs. replay methods), model agnosticism vs. performance

- Failure signatures: Low EC indicates failure to edit similar items; low EP indicates over-editing; high EA but low EC/EP suggests overfitting to explicit editing pairs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement E-BPR loss and verify it correctly ranks unsuitable items lower than others in simple MF model
  2. Compare FT vs. EFT on LightGCN model with Epinions dataset to validate model-agnostic editing claims
  3. Measure impact of editing pair quantity on EA, EC, and EP metrics to understand scalability limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can recommendation editing methods be designed to effectively handle the potential for adversarial attacks that manipulate the editing process?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the importance of rectifying unsuitable recommendations, but does not address the potential for malicious actors to exploit the editing process by introducing false negative signals.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on developing effective editing methods and evaluation metrics, but does not consider the security implications of the editing process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating the vulnerability of recommendation editing methods to adversarial attacks and proposing robust defenses against such attacks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can recommendation editing methods be designed to ensure fairness and prevent biased outcomes in the edited recommendations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes the importance of rectifying unsuitable recommendations, but does not address the potential for biased outcomes if certain items or content types are unfairly favored over others.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the technical aspects of editing methods and evaluation metrics, but does not consider the ethical implications of the editing process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating the potential for bias in recommendation editing methods and proposing techniques to mitigate bias and ensure fairness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can recommendation editing methods be designed to minimize the risk of catastrophic forgetting in dynamically evolving environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the importance of rectifying unsuitable recommendations, but does not address the potential for the system to forget previously learned preferences or associations due to continual edits.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the immediate task of editing recommendations, but does not consider the long-term impact of editing on the system's ability to provide consistent and reliable recommendations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating the impact of continual editing on the system's long-term performance and proposing techniques to mitigate the risk of catastrophic forgetting.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on synthetic editing scenarios where unsuitable items are known a priori, which may not fully capture real-world ambiguity in user feedback
- The study focuses on relatively small datasets (maximum 1 million interactions), leaving scalability questions for industrial-scale recommendation systems unanswered
- The framework does not address potential adversarial attacks or security vulnerabilities in the editing process

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core mechanism of E-BPR loss for editing recommendations is well-grounded in established BPR theory, with clear mathematical formulation and empirical validation across multiple datasets.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about model-agnostic editing capabilities are supported by experiments with three different base models, but the diversity of tested architectures remains limited.

**Medium confidence**: The three-metric evaluation framework comprehensively captures different aspects of editing quality, though the relative importance of each metric in practical scenarios requires further user studies.

## Next Checks

1. Test scalability by applying editing methods to datasets with 10M+ interactions to identify performance bottlenecks and memory constraints.

2. Conduct A/B testing with real users to validate that edited recommendations lead to improved user satisfaction compared to unedited or retrain-based approaches.

3. Investigate the robustness of editing methods when the original model architecture is unknown by applying them to black-box APIs rather than accessible model weights.
