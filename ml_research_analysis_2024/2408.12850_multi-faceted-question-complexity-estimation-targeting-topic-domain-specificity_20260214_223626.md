# Multi-Faceted Question Complexity Estimation Targeting Topic Domain-Specificity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12850
- Authors: Sujay R; Suki Perumal; Yash Nagraj; Anushka Ghei; Srinivas K S
- Reference count: 34
- Linear regression model achieves MSE of 3.06 and R-squared of 0.42 on 100-question dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for estimating question difficulty in educational settings by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and knowledge graph analysis. The framework operationalizes four key parameters - Topic Retrieval Cost, Topic Salience, Topic Coherence, and Topic Superficiality - each capturing a distinct facet of question complexity within a subject domain. These parameters are calculated using topic modeling, knowledge graph analysis, and information retrieval techniques. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 100 questions from a Computer Networks textbook, demonstrating its potential for application in question generation, assessment design, and adaptive learning systems.

## Method Summary
The framework estimates question complexity through four domain-specific parameters calculated using topic modeling and knowledge graph analysis. Questions are first preprocessed to extract keywords using KeyBERT, then topic distributions are generated using BERTopic trained on multiple textbooks. For each question, Topic Retrieval Cost measures how far topics are from the central topic, Topic Salience measures how well-represented topics are in the knowledge graph, Topic Coherence measures semantic similarity between related topics, and Topic Superficiality measures topic overlap. These features are then used to train a linear regression model that predicts question difficulty scores. The framework was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a curated dataset of 100 Computer Networks questions.

## Key Results
- Linear regression model trained on four extracted features achieves MSE of 3.06 and R-squared of 0.42
- Framework successfully operationalizes four distinct complexity parameters through NLP and knowledge graph techniques
- Evaluation conducted on 100 questions from Computer Networks textbook with manual difficulty labeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing question complexity into measurable components that reflect different cognitive demands. Topic Retrieval Cost captures the effort needed to locate relevant information, Topic Salience reflects the depth of topic coverage in authoritative sources, Topic Coherence measures semantic relationships between concepts, and Topic Superficiality indicates conceptual overlap. By quantifying these aspects through topic modeling and knowledge graph analysis, the framework creates a multidimensional representation of question complexity that correlates with human-assigned difficulty ratings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Topic Modeling**: Used to identify and represent underlying themes in educational content
  - Why needed: To quantify how questions span different conceptual areas
  - Quick check: Verify topic distributions capture meaningful subject matter divisions

- **Knowledge Graph Analysis**: Leverages structured information from DBpedia to assess topic relationships
  - Why needed: To measure semantic relationships and coverage depth beyond simple keyword matching
  - Quick check: Confirm topic-to-Wikipedia article mappings are accurate and comprehensive

- **Information Retrieval Cost**: Quantifies the effort needed to locate relevant information
  - Why needed: To capture the cognitive load of finding and integrating information
  - Quick check: Verify distance metrics between topics reflect intuitive conceptual relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: GPT-4 question generation -> Keyword extraction (KeyBERT) -> Topic modeling (BERTopic) -> Feature calculation -> Linear regression

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming steps are GPT-4 question generation and BERTopic training on multiple textbooks. The feature calculation for individual questions is relatively fast once the topic model and knowledge graph queries are established.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses DBpedia for knowledge graph analysis (good coverage but potential gaps) rather than domain-specific ontologies. Employs linear regression for simplicity rather than more complex models. Relies on GPT-4 for question generation rather than manual creation.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance if topic modeling fails to capture domain-specific concepts, if knowledge graph has coverage gaps for technical terms, or if the linear relationship between features and difficulty doesn't hold. Feature quality issues manifest as inconsistent difficulty predictions across similar questions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate topic distributions on a small subset of questions manually; 2) Test DBpedia query accuracy for a sample of technical terms; 3) Perform ablation study to determine individual feature contributions to model performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but based on the methodology and results, several important questions arise regarding the framework's generalizability and potential improvements.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to 100 questions from a single subject domain (Computer Networks)
- Reliance on DBpedia knowledge graph introduces potential coverage gaps for technical concepts
- Manual difficulty labeling introduces subjectivity that could affect model training
- Framework's performance across different educational domains remains untested

## Confidence
High Confidence: Methodology for calculating complexity parameters is clearly specified with detailed mathematical formulations; linear regression approach and evaluation metrics are standard and appropriate.
Medium Confidence: Framework design and parameter intuition are well-justified, but impact of individual parameters on final complexity score is not thoroughly analyzed.
Low Confidence: Generalizability across different subject domains and educational contexts is not established due to limited evaluation scope.

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Transferability Test**: Evaluate framework on question datasets from different subject domains (mathematics, biology, history) to assess generalizability beyond Computer Networks.
2. **Knowledge Graph Coverage Analysis**: Systematically analyze DBpedia's coverage of technical concepts in Computer Networks and other STEM domains to quantify potential gaps affecting complexity estimation.
3. **Parameter Importance Analysis**: Perform ablation studies to determine relative contribution of each complexity parameter to model performance and analyze feature importance.
