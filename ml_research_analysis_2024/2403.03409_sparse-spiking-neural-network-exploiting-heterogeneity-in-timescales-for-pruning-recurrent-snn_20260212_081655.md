- Primary result: Task-agnostic pruning method using Lyapunov exponents achieves sparse RSNNs with comparable performance to task-specific methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP), a task-agnostic methodology for designing sparse recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs). Unlike traditional approaches that prune dense networks trained on specific tasks, LNP starts with a randomly initialized dense model and prunes it using spectral graph sparsification methods and Lyapunov exponents to ensure stability. The method leverages heterogeneity in neuronal timescales to design a sparse Heterogeneous RSNN (HRSNN). The pruned HRSNN model can be trained for various tasks, such as image classification and temporal prediction, demonstrating comparable performance to task-dependent pruning methods while being more computationally efficient.

## Method Summary
LNP is a task-agnostic pruning algorithm that uses Lyapunov exponents and spectral graph sparsification to prune synapses and neurons in recurrent spiking neural networks while preserving stability. The method starts with a randomly initialized dense HRSNN and applies a 4-step pruning process: synapse pruning based on Lyapunov matrices and firing rate covariances, node pruning using betweenness centrality, eigenvector delocalization to enhance stability, and timescale optimization. The resulting sparse model can be trained for various tasks without task-specific pretraining, leveraging neuronal timescale heterogeneity to enhance performance and stability.

## Key Results
- LNP achieves sparse HRSNNs with fewer neurons and synapses while maintaining comparable performance to task-dependent pruning methods
- The task-agnostic approach generalizes across different tasks (image classification and time-series prediction) without overfitting
- Leveraging heterogeneity in neuronal timescales improves the quality of sparse HRSNN design and enhances performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LNP leverages Lyapunov exponents and spectral graph sparsification to prune synapses while preserving stability and performance of HRSNNs.
- Mechanism: The method computes a Lyapunov matrix based on harmonic mean of Lyapunov exponents from neighboring nodes. Synapses are probabilistically pruned based on this matrix and firing rate covariances, ensuring stability is maintained.
- Core assumption: The Lyapunov spectrum of an HRSNN accurately reflects its stability properties and can guide pruning without task-specific training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP) algorithm that uses graph sparsification methods and utilizes Lyapunov exponents to design a stable sparse RSNN"
  - [section]: "We leverage the Lyapunov spectrum of an HRSNN model and techniques from spectral graph sparsification algorithms to prune synapses and neurons while keeping the network stable"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations supporting Lyapunov-based pruning for SNNs
- Break condition: If the Lyapunov spectrum fails to capture network dynamics accurately or if pruning based solely on it leads to performance collapse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neuronal timescale heterogeneity improves the quality of sparse HRSNN design by aiding pruning and enhancing performance.
- Mechanism: By assigning distinct membrane time constants sampled from a gamma distribution, the model creates varied integration/relaxation dynamics. LNP uses this diversity to optimize timescales during pruning, leading to more stable and adaptable sparse networks.
- Core assumption: Diversity in neuronal timescales contributes to network stability and generalization across tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show that the LNP can leverage diversity in neuronal timescales to design a sparse Heterogeneous RSNN (HRSNN)"
  - [section]: "The proposed approach leverages the diversity of neuronal timescales in an HRSNN to assist in pruning and enhance the performance of the sparse HRSNN"
  - [corpus]: Moderate - prior works cited on heterogeneity benefits, but not specifically in LNP context
- Break condition: If timescale optimization does not improve stability or if uniform timescales perform equally well after pruning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Task-agnostic pruning produces sparse models that generalize across multiple tasks without overfitting.
- Mechanism: LNP prunes without task-specific training data, optimizing topology and neuronal timescales based on stability metrics rather than performance targets. This avoids overfitting to a single task and allows the same sparse model to be trained for different applications.
- Core assumption: Stability-focused pruning preserves essential network structure that supports diverse task learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The pruning algorithms developed in this paper is task-agnostic... the same sparse HRSNN obtained by LNP can be trained for various tasks, namely, image classification and time-series prediction"
  - [section]: "Instead of minimizing (or constraining) performance loss for a given task, LNP optimizes the model structure and parameters while pruning to preserve the stability of the sparse HRSNN"
  - [corpus]: Strong - direct comparison with task-dependent pruning showing better generalization
- Break condition: If task-agnostic pruning leads to significantly worse performance compared to task-specific methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lyapunov exponents and stability analysis of dynamical systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to compute and interpret Lyapunov exponents is essential for implementing the pruning algorithm and ensuring network stability.
  - Quick check question: What does a positive Lyapunov exponent indicate about a dynamical system's behavior?

- Concept: Spectral graph sparsification methods
  - Why needed here: These methods are used to reduce network complexity while preserving spectral properties, which is key to maintaining performance after pruning.
  - Quick check question: How does spectral graph sparsification differ from simple edge removal in terms of preserving network properties?

- Concept: Heterogeneity in neuronal parameters and its effects
  - Why needed here: The model leverages diversity in neuronal timescales; understanding why this matters helps in implementing and tuning the algorithm.
  - Quick check question: How does introducing heterogeneity in membrane time constants affect the computational capabilities of an SNN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input encoder -> Heterogeneous Recurrent Spiking Neural Network (HRSNN) core -> Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP) module -> Readout layer -> Decoder (for prediction tasks only)

- Critical path:
  1. Randomly initialize dense HRSNN/CHRSNN
  2. Apply LNP pruning (4 steps) to obtain sparse model
  3. Train sparse model on target task using STDP or BP
  4. Evaluate performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Task-agnostic vs. task-dependent pruning: generalization vs. task-specific optimization
  - Sparsity level vs. performance: higher sparsity may reduce computational cost but risk performance loss
  - Neuronal timescale diversity vs. model complexity: heterogeneity improves performance but increases parameter space

- Failure signatures:
  - Unstable dynamics after pruning (positive Lyapunov exponents)
  - Large performance drop post-pruning
  - Overfitting to specific tasks despite task-agnostic design
  - Insufficient sparsity gains relative to computational cost

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement LNP on a simple 2D chaotic system (e.g., Lorenz) to verify stability preservation
  2. Compare pruned HRSNN performance on image classification vs. time-series prediction
  3. Vary sparsity levels and measure tradeoff between computational efficiency and task performance
