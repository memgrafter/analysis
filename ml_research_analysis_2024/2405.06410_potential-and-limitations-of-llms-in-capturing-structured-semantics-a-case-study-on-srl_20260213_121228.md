# Potential and Limitations of LLMs in Capturing Structured Semantics: A Case Study on SRL

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.06410
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06410
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LLMs can capture semantic structures through prompt-based SRL, but scaling doesn't always improve performance and show significant error overlap with untrained humans (30%).

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates large language models' (LLMs) capability to capture structured semantics through semantic role labeling (SRL). The authors introduce PromptSRL, a few-shot SRL parser that uses carefully designed prompts to guide LLMs in mapping natural language to explicit semantic structures. Through experiments with multiple LLMs including Llama2 and ChatGPT, they find that while LLMs can indeed capture semantic structures, performance doesn't always scale with model size, and interestingly, LLMs make similar errors to untrained humans in nearly 30% of cases.

## Method Summary
The study employs a prompt-based approach called PromptSRL that uses four-stage pipeline: predicate disambiguation, role retrieval, argument labeling, and post-processing. The method leverages few-shot exemplars from training sets and frame descriptions from PropBank to design prompts for each stage. LLMs are used to identify arguments of predicates and assign semantic roles through these prompts without any fine-tuning. The approach is evaluated on CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2012 test sets using micro F1 score as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- LLMs can effectively capture semantic structures through prompt-based conditioning, demonstrating their ability to map natural language to explicit semantic roles.
- Scaling up LLMs does not consistently improve SRL performance, suggesting that model architecture and prompt design may be more critical than sheer size.
- Significant overlap exists between LLM errors and untrained human errors (up to 30%), particularly in handling C-arguments and R-arguments.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can map natural language to explicit semantic structures through prompt-based conditioning.
- Mechanism: The PromptSRL approach uses structured prompts that tie to linguistic theory (PropBank frame descriptions) to guide LLMs in extracting semantic roles. By providing exemplar role descriptions and JSON-formatted output expectations, the model learns to identify and label arguments corresponding to predicates.
- Core assumption: LLMs possess latent semantic understanding that can be surfaced via appropriate prompting without fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PromptSRL enables LLMs to map natural languages to explicit semantic structures, which provides an interpretable window into the properties of LLMs."
  - [section 3.3] "We adopt prompt-based inference with LLMs. We use LLMs to identify the arguments of the predicate and assign them their corresponding semantic roles through a designed prompt."
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to understand the semantic structure even with explicit prompts, or if the prompts are poorly designed relative to the linguistic theory.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Scaling up LLMs does not always improve SRL performance, indicating a non-linear relationship between model size and semantic understanding.
- Mechanism: While larger models like GPT-4 might be expected to perform better, the study finds that smaller models can perform comparably or even better in certain SRL tasks. This suggests that model architecture and prompt design may be more critical than sheer size for this specific task.
- Core assumption: Model performance is not solely determined by parameter count but also by how well the model's architecture aligns with the task's semantic requirements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs can indeed capture semantic structures, and scaling-up doesn't always mirror potential."
  - [section 5.1] "We find that SRL performances are not always proportional to LLMs' scales but reflect the varying capabilities of LLMs in capturing semantics with natural instructions (i.e., prompts)."
- Break condition: If scaling up the model consistently improves performance across all SRL tasks, contradicting the study's findings.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs make similar errors to untrained humans, suggesting shared limitations in semantic understanding.
- Mechanism: The overlap in errors between LLMs and untrained humans (up to 30%) indicates that both struggle with similar aspects of semantic role labeling, such as identifying discontinuous arguments (C-arguments) and resolving references (R-arguments). This suggests inherent difficulties in the task rather than model-specific limitations.
- Core assumption: The error patterns reflect fundamental challenges in understanding structured semantics, not just model limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We are surprised to discover that significant overlap in the errors is made by both LLMs and untrained humans, accounting for almost 30% of all errors."
  - [section 5.4] "Up to nearly 30% of overlapping mistakes are made by both the LLM and untrained humans."
- Break condition: If the error overlap is found to be coincidental or if human performance significantly improves with training, reducing the overlap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the core task of extracting predicate-argument structures is essential for grasping how LLMs are evaluated in this study.
  - Quick check question: What are the primary semantic roles (e.g., A0, A1) and how do they relate to the predicate in a sentence?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of PromptSRL hinges on the design of prompts that guide LLMs to output the desired semantic structures.
  - Quick check question: How do the frame descriptions from PropBank enhance the LLM's understanding of argument roles compared to symbolic abbreviations?

- Concept: Error Analysis in NLP
  - Why needed here: Analyzing the types of errors made by LLMs (e.g., C-arguments, R-arguments) provides insights into their limitations and areas for improvement.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes C-arguments from R-arguments, and why might these be challenging for both LLMs and humans?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Predicate disambiguation -> Role retrieval -> Argument labeling -> Post-processing
- Critical path: The most critical path is the argument labeling stage, where the LLM must accurately identify and label arguments based on the prompt. Errors here propagate through the post-processing stage.
- Design tradeoffs: The tradeoff between using more exemplars and maintaining a concise prompt length affects performance. More exemplars can improve understanding but may exceed token limits.
- Failure signatures: Common failures include incorrect handling of C-arguments and R-arguments, long-range dependency issues, and nuanced differences between similar argument roles.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate PromptSRL on a small dataset to ensure the basic pipeline works and the LLM can follow the prompts.
  2. Test different prompt designs (e.g., with/without frame descriptions) to optimize performance.
  3. Analyze error patterns to identify specific areas where the LLM struggles, such as C-arguments or R-arguments.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out specific open questions, but several implications emerge from the findings regarding the potential and limitations of LLMs in capturing structured semantics.

## Limitations
- The error overlap between LLMs and untrained humans may be influenced by the specific evaluation dataset or prompt design.
- The claim that scaling does not always improve performance is based on a limited set of models and tasks, which may not generalize to other semantic understanding tasks.
- The PromptSRL approach relies on carefully designed prompts, but the exact templates and their optimization are not fully specified.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: LLMs can map natural language to explicit semantic structures through prompt-based conditioning (Mechanism 1).
- **Medium Confidence**: Scaling up LLMs does not always improve SRL performance, indicating a non-linear relationship between model size and semantic understanding (Mechanism 2).
- **Medium Confidence**: LLMs make similar errors to untrained humans, suggesting shared limitations in semantic understanding (Mechanism 3).

## Next Checks
1. Replicate error analysis across diverse datasets to confirm the 30% overlap between LLM and human errors.
2. Test PromptSRL with a broader range of model sizes to validate the claim that scaling doesn't always improve performance.
3. Experiment with different prompt templates and exemplar counts to determine the optimal configuration for SRL tasks.
