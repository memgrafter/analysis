# Fine-Tuning and Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models for the Army Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.20297
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20297
- Authors: Daniel C. Ruiz; John Sell
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduced TRACLM family of fine-tuned LLMs and MilBench evaluation framework for Army domain applications

## Executive Summary
This paper presents TRACLM, a series of fine-tuned large language models specifically adapted for Army domain applications, and MilBench, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance on Army-specific tasks. Through three generations of iterative development, the authors demonstrate how fine-tuning open-source LLMs on Army doctrine and publications can significantly improve domain-specific knowledge while maintaining general capabilities. The MilBench framework provides both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods, leveraging Army exams and MilGLUE datasets to assess model performance across 11 distinct tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tuned open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-v0.1) on a corpus of over 4,300 unclassified Army documents, employing different training strategies across three TRACLM versions. The process involved data preprocessing, continued pretraining on domain-specific text, instruction tuning with synthetically generated Q&A pairs, and alignment techniques. MilBench was developed as a model-agnostic evaluation framework using multiple-choice questions derived from Army officer exams and MilGLUE datasets. The evaluation pipeline supports both automated quantitative scoring and human-in-the-loop qualitative assessments, with code made publicly available for reproducibility.

## Key Results
- TRACLM-v3 achieved 69.20% average accuracy across 11 Army-specific tasks, outperforming base models and open-source LLMs
- Each successive generation of TRACLM showed marked improvement, with TRACLM-v3 demonstrating superior performance on both domain-specific and general tasks
- The fine-tuning approach successfully injected Army-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities, though context window limitations and hallucination risks were identified

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning injects domain-specific Army knowledge into open-source LLMs, improving performance on Army-specific tasks
- Mechanism: Training a pre-trained LLM on a corpus of Army doctrine and publications exposes it to domain-specific vocabulary, acronyms, and concepts. This allows the model to learn the statistical patterns and relationships between these domain-specific terms and their context, leading to improved performance on tasks requiring Army knowledge
- Core assumption: The Army doctrine and publications corpus provides sufficient and representative domain-specific knowledge to improve LLM performance
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "each successive iteration of TRACLM displayed improved capabilities when applied to Army tasks and use cases"; [section] "Table 2: Performance across TRACLM Versions (†denotes Army-specific task)... each successive generation of TRACLM improved markedly over the preceding version(s)"; [corpus] The corpus consists of over 4,300 unclassified Army documents

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MilBench provides a quantitative evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance on Army-specific tasks
- Mechanism: MilBench leverages curated tasks from Army exams and MilGLUE datasets to create multiple-choice questions that test an LLM's knowledge of Army-specific concepts. By comparing the LLM's responses to the correct answers, MilBench can provide a quantitative measure of the LLM's performance on these tasks
- Core assumption: Multiple-choice questions are an effective way to evaluate an LLM's knowledge of Army-specific concepts
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MilBench offers a scalable, model-agnostic evaluation pipeline, supporting both quantitative and qualitative assessments"; [section] "MilBench is a collection of benchmarking datasets aggregated and maintained by TRAC and a modular software framework that enables organizations of all sizes to easily evaluate and assess LLMs at scale"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The TRACLM project provides a roadmap for fine-tuning open-source LLMs for domain-specific applications
- Mechanism: The paper details the techniques and lessons learned from fine-tuning three generations of TRACLM models, including data preprocessing, training pipeline design, and evaluation methods. This information can be used by other organizations to develop their own domain-specific LLMs
- Core assumption: The techniques and lessons learned from the TRACLM project are generalizable to other domain-specific LLM fine-tuning efforts
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Contributions include: A detailed road-map for fine-tuning three TRACLM versions, highlighting techniques that improved model performance with each iteration"; [section] "In response to our problem statement and research questions, this paper documents techniques, results, and lessons learned in both the development and evaluation of TRACLM and MilBench"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their pre-training process
  - Why needed here: Understanding LLMs and their pre-training is crucial for understanding how fine-tuning can improve their performance on domain-specific tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of pre-training in LLMs, and how does it differ from fine-tuning?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and domain-specific language
  - Why needed here: NLP techniques are used to preprocess and analyze the Army doctrine and publications corpus, and understanding domain-specific language is essential for creating effective evaluation tasks
  - Quick check question: What are some common NLP techniques used in domain-specific LLM fine-tuning, and how do they help improve model performance?

- Concept: Machine Learning (ML) evaluation metrics and benchmarks
  - Why needed here: Understanding ML evaluation metrics and benchmarks is crucial for interpreting the results of the TRACLM project and comparing its performance to other models
  - Quick check question: What are some common ML evaluation metrics used for LLMs, and how do they differ from those used for other ML models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TRACLM (fine-tuned LLMs) -> MilBench (evaluation framework) -> Army doctrine corpus (training data) -> Army exams/MilGLUE (evaluation tasks)

- Critical path:
  1. Acquire and preprocess the Army doctrine and publications corpus
  2. Fine-tune an open-source LLM on the preprocessed corpus for one epoch
  3. Generate synthetic Q&A pairs from the corpus using a larger LLM and fine-tune the model on these pairs
  4. Create evaluation tasks using Army exams and MilGLUE datasets
  5. Evaluate the fine-tuned LLM using MilBench
  6. Analyze the results and iterate on the fine-tuning process

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Corpus size vs. domain specificity: A larger corpus may provide more diverse training data, but a smaller, more domain-specific corpus may lead to better performance on Army-specific tasks
  - Fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering: Fine-tuning requires more computational resources but may lead to better performance, while prompt engineering is less resource-intensive but may not be as effective for complex tasks

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on Army-specific tasks: This may indicate that the fine-tuning process was not effective or that the evaluation tasks are not representative of the domain
  - High rate of hallucination: This may indicate that the LLM is not adequately grounded in the domain-specific knowledge and is generating incorrect information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune a small open-source LLM on a subset of the Army doctrine and publications corpus and evaluate its performance on a simple Army-specific task
  2. Compare the performance of the fine-tuned LLM to a general-purpose LLM on a set of Army-specific tasks
  3. Experiment with different fine-tuning techniques, such as using synthetic training data or applying model alignment methods, to improve the LLM's performance on Army-specific tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between continued pretraining and instruction-tuning in the TRACLM training pipeline for maximizing domain-specific knowledge acquisition while minimizing loss of general knowledge?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses TRACLM-v2's two-stage training pipeline (continued pretraining followed by instruction-tuning) versus TRACLM-v3's single-stage approach, noting this as an area requiring further research
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this question but does not provide comparative results between the two approaches under identical conditions. The performance differences observed could be due to multiple factors beyond the training pipeline structure
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment fine-tuning identical base models using both approaches with the same dataset, followed by comprehensive evaluation on both domain-specific and general benchmarks to measure knowledge retention and acquisition trade-offs

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of TRACLM models degrade when processing text containing Army jargon and acronyms that were not present in the training corpus?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the models' capabilities with Army-specific vocabulary but does not test their performance on out-of-distribution Army terminology or measure degradation rates
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates improved performance on known Army terminology, it does not quantify how well the models generalize to novel Army-specific terms or how their performance degrades with unfamiliar domain vocabulary
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of TRACLM models on progressively increasing amounts of novel Army terminology, measuring accuracy degradation and comparing performance against baseline models to determine the extent of learned generalization

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between context window limitations and hallucination rates in TRACLM models, and how does this vary across different types of Army domain tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies context window constraints and increased hallucination rates near the limit as limitations, theorizing this is influenced by the direct communication style of Army documents
- Why unresolved: The paper observes these issues but does not provide quantitative analysis of how hallucination rates correlate with context usage across different task types or document structures within the Army domain
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring hallucination rates at various distances from context window limits across different Army document types (operational orders, doctrine, technical manuals) to establish correlation patterns and task-specific vulnerabilities

## Limitations

- The evaluation framework relies on a curated set of Army-specific tasks that may not fully represent the breadth of domain knowledge required for operational use
- The corpus size, while substantial for doctrine documents, represents only a fraction of the information an Army professional encounters
- The paper acknowledges context window limitations and hallucination risks but does not provide quantitative measurements of these effects

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific corpora is well-established and the performance improvements on Army-specific benchmarks are empirically demonstrated

**Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of the TRACLM approach to other military domains or different LLM architectures is reasonable but not empirically validated

**Low Confidence**: The long-term stability and safety of the fine-tuned models for operational deployment, particularly regarding hallucination prevention and adversarial robustness, are not adequately addressed

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus Completeness Validation**: Conduct a comprehensive analysis comparing the training corpus coverage against a random sampling of actual Army documents used in operational contexts to identify potential knowledge gaps

2. **Task Format Diversity Testing**: Extend MilBench to include open-ended response evaluation and scenario-based assessments to validate that multiple-choice performance translates to more complex task completion

3. **Adversarial Robustness Assessment**: Systematically test TRACLM models against known LLM attack vectors and hallucination-inducing prompts to establish safety boundaries for operational use
