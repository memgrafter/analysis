# CivRealm: A Learning and Reasoning Odyssey in Civilization for Decision-Making Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.10568
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10568
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: A Civilization-inspired game environment evaluating decision-making agents' learning and reasoning abilities with imperfect information, dynamic spaces, and multi-agent interactions.

## Executive Summary
CivRealm is a novel game environment inspired by the Civilization series, designed to benchmark decision-making agents' capabilities in complex, open-ended scenarios. The environment features imperfect information, dynamic state and action spaces, multi-agent interactions, and requires diplomacy and negotiation skills. CivRealm includes mini-games targeting specific skills and supports both tensor-based (RL) and language-based (LLM) agent interfaces. The evaluation reveals that while RL agents perform reasonably in structured mini-games, they struggle with full-game complexity and sparse rewards. LLM-based agents, particularly hierarchical approaches, show better adaptation to open-ended gameplay but face challenges in long-term strategic planning.

## Method Summary
CivRealm implements a Civilization-inspired environment with imperfect information, dynamic state and action spaces, and multi-agent interactions. The environment includes mini-games targeting specific skills and supports both tensor-based RL and language-based LLM agent interfaces. Tensor-based agents operate through traditional state-action representations, while language-based agents interact through natural language prompts. The environment features a custom observation and action space design, incorporating temporal abstractions and hierarchical decision-making structures. A unique aspect is the integration of mini-games that target specific reasoning and planning skills, allowing for granular evaluation of agent capabilities.

## Key Results
- Tensor-based RL agents show reasonable performance in structured mini-games but struggle with full-game complexity and sparse rewards
- LLM-based agents, including hierarchical approaches (Mastaba), demonstrate better adaptation to open-ended gameplay
- Both agent types face challenges in long-term strategic planning and reasoning, highlighting the environment's difficulty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CivRealm leverages the complex, multi-faceted nature of Civilization-like gameplay to create a challenging benchmark for decision-making agents. The environment's design forces agents to balance exploration, diplomacy, resource management, and military strategy while operating under imperfect information. The dynamic state and action spaces prevent agents from relying on static strategies, while the multi-agent interactions require sophisticated social reasoning. The integration of mini-games allows for targeted skill assessment, while the full game provides a holistic evaluation of agent capabilities. The dual interface (tensor and language) enables comparison between traditional RL approaches and modern LLM-based agents.

## Foundational Learning
- **Imperfect Information Handling**: Agents must make decisions with incomplete knowledge of the game state - why needed for realistic strategic scenarios; quick check: evaluate performance with varying information disclosure levels
- **Dynamic State Space Adaptation**: The environment state changes continuously, requiring real-time adaptation - why needed for realistic strategic scenarios; quick check: measure performance consistency across different game phases
- **Multi-Agent Social Reasoning**: Success requires understanding and influencing other agents' behaviors - why needed for realistic strategic scenarios; quick check: assess diplomatic strategy effectiveness
- **Temporal Abstraction**: Long-term planning across multiple time scales - why needed for complex strategy games; quick check: evaluate planning horizon effectiveness
- **Sparse Reward Navigation**: Delayed and infrequent rewards require sophisticated credit assignment - why needed for realistic strategic scenarios; quick check: measure learning efficiency with different reward structures
- **Language-Based Reasoning**: LLM agents must parse and respond to complex game descriptions - why needed for natural interaction; quick check: evaluate language comprehension accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Environment Engine -> Observation Processor -> Agent Interface (Tensor or Language) -> Action Executor -> Game State Updater

**Critical Path**
Observation Processor -> Agent Decision -> Action Execution -> State Update -> New Observation

**Design Tradeoffs**
The environment prioritizes open-ended gameplay over simplified reward structures, trading immediate learning efficiency for more realistic strategic complexity. The dual interface design allows for broader agent evaluation but introduces implementation complexity. The mini-game integration provides targeted assessment but may not fully capture full-game dynamics.

**Failure Signatures**
- RL agents: Poor performance in long-term planning, difficulty with sparse rewards, over-specialization to mini-game patterns
- LLM agents: Inconsistent reasoning across different game states, prompt sensitivity, difficulty with numerical calculations

**First Experiments**
1. Run a single agent through all mini-games to establish baseline performance across different skill domains
2. Implement a simple heuristic agent to establish upper bounds for specific mini-game tasks
3. Test both agent interfaces in a simplified game mode with full information to isolate interface-specific challenges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation metrics remain incomplete for capturing full agent capabilities in complex scenarios
- Language-based interfaces rely heavily on prompt engineering, limiting generalization
- Direct performance comparisons between tensor-based and language-based approaches are difficult due to different evaluation metrics

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The environment design and implementation are technically sound, with clear documentation of game mechanics and agent interfaces. The reported performance differences between RL and LLM agents in mini-games are well-supported by empirical evidence.

**Medium Confidence**: The LLM-based agent performance claims, particularly regarding the hierarchical approach (Mastaba), are supported by results but may be influenced by specific prompt engineering choices and model selection. The generalization of these results to other LLM architectures requires further validation.

**Low Confidence**: Long-term strategic planning performance claims for both agent types are based on limited episodes and may not capture the full complexity of CivRealm's open-ended gameplay. The sparse reward handling mechanisms' effectiveness is not thoroughly evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. Implement cross-validation with multiple LLM architectures to verify the robustness of language-based agent performance across different model families and sizes.
2. Design a standardized evaluation framework that enables direct comparison between tensor-based and language-based agents using consistent metrics across all game modes.
3. Conduct extended testing sessions with increased episode counts and varied starting conditions to better assess long-term strategic planning capabilities and sparse reward handling.
