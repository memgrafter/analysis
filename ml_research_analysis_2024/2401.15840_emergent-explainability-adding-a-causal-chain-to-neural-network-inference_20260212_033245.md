# Emergent Explainability: Adding a causal chain to neural network inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15840
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15840
- Authors: Adam Perrett
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Proposes framework for causal AI explainability through emergent communication

## Executive Summary
This position paper introduces a novel approach to explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) by proposing the use of emergent communication (EmCom) to create causal understanding in AI model outputs. The framework aims to shift from traditional associative relationships between inputs and outputs to a more nuanced causal interpretation, potentially transforming how we interact with and trust AI systems across multiple domains. The paper presents a theoretical framework that leverages synthetic data to train agents that communicate task-specific messages, enabling the emergence of a generalized communication language that could provide causal explanations for AI decisions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework where synthetic data is used to train agents that communicate task-specific messages, with the goal of creating emergent communication that generalizes across unseen data. The methodology involves shifting from conventional associative relationships to causal interpretations through a communication channel between agents. The framework suggests that as the number of "taught" examples increases, the generalization of communication approaches 100% testing accuracy on unseen data. While the theoretical framework is well-articulated, specific implementation details and empirical validation remain theoretical at this stage.

## Key Results
- Theoretical framework shows emergent communication can achieve near-perfect generalization (100% testing accuracy) on unseen data as taught examples increase
- Proposes shift from associative to causal interpretation in AI model outputs through emergent communication
- Suggests potential to redefine AI interactions across domains like healthcare, fostering trust and informed decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a communication channel between agents that allows for the emergence of task-specific languages. These languages encode causal relationships rather than just associative patterns, enabling the model to provide explanations that reflect true causal chains rather than mere correlations. The synthetic data environment allows agents to develop communication protocols that capture the underlying causal structure of the task domain, which can then be generalized to new instances.

## Foundational Learning
- **Emergent Communication (EmCom)**: Why needed - To create task-specific languages that emerge from agent interactions; Quick check - Agents must develop consistent communication protocols across training runs
- **Causal Inference**: Why needed - To move beyond associative relationships to true cause-effect understanding; Quick check - Framework must demonstrate ability to distinguish correlation from causation
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Why needed - To create controlled environments for testing causal relationships; Quick check - Synthetic data must preserve causal structures while being diverse enough for generalization
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Why needed - To enable communication channels that can develop emergent languages; Quick check - Agent interactions must lead to stable communication protocols
- **Explainability in AI**: Why needed - To make AI decision-making transparent and trustworthy; Quick check - Generated explanations must be interpretable by humans
- **Causal Chain Construction**: Why needed - To provide step-by-step reasoning for AI outputs; Quick check - Each step in the causal chain must be verifiable and logically connected

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generator -> Multi-agent Training System -> Communication Protocol Emergence -> Causal Chain Extraction -> Human Interpretable Explanations

**Critical Path**: Data generation → agent training → communication emergence → causal chain formation → explanation output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades empirical validation for theoretical innovation, prioritizing conceptual advancement over practical implementation. The use of synthetic data enables controlled experimentation but may limit real-world applicability.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include agents developing non-generalizable communication protocols, emergence of communication that doesn't capture true causal relationships, or failure to produce human-interpretable explanations from the emergent communication.

**First 3 Experiments**: 
1. Test emergent communication generalization on increasingly complex synthetic datasets
2. Validate causal chain extraction from agent communications using known causal structures
3. Evaluate human interpretability of generated explanations through user studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the emergent communication framework perform when applied to real-world healthcare datasets compared to synthetic data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the framework using synthetic data and mentions that integration with human interpretable message passing is currently theoretical, suggesting further work is needed to apply it to real-world datasets.
- Why unresolved: The current research is limited to synthetic data, and the paper explicitly states that integration with human interpretable message passing is theoretical, indicating that real-world applications have not yet been tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using real-world healthcare datasets and comparing the performance and explainability of the framework to existing methods would provide evidence of its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific mechanisms by which the emergent communication framework achieves causality in AI model outputs, and how can these mechanisms be quantified?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the shift from associative to causal interpretation and mentions that the messages used in emergent communication can be made human interpretable, implying a causal relationship between the message and the output.
- Why unresolved: While the paper outlines the theoretical framework for achieving causality, it does not provide detailed mechanisms or quantification methods for how this causality is established and measured.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed experimental results showing the causal pathways and quantitative measures of causality in the model outputs would clarify the mechanisms by which the framework achieves causal understanding.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the emergent communication framework address potential biases in AI models, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the importance of understanding causality to mitigate potential bias in AI models, especially in healthcare, but does not provide specific strategies for addressing these biases within the emergent communication framework.
- Why unresolved: The paper emphasizes the need for causal understanding to address bias but lacks a detailed discussion on how the emergent communication framework specifically tackles bias issues.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experiments demonstrating the framework's ability to identify and mitigate biases in AI models, particularly in healthcare applications, would provide insights into its effectiveness in addressing bias.

## Limitations
- Framework remains theoretical with no empirical validation or experimental results presented
- Relies entirely on synthetic data without testing on real-world datasets or practical applications
- Lacks concrete implementation details, performance metrics, and quantitative validation of claims

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework validity: Medium
- Practical applicability: Low
- Empirical claims: Low
- Novel contribution: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement the proposed framework using synthetic datasets and validate the claimed 100% testing accuracy on unseen data
2. Conduct experiments to quantify the causal relationships established through emergent communication using established causal inference metrics
3. Test the framework's performance on real-world healthcare datasets to evaluate practical applicability and bias mitigation capabilities
