# GigaPevt: Multimodal Medical Assistant

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.16654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16654
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: 93.36% QA accuracy, 71.59% NLI accuracy on RuMedBench dataset

## Executive Summary
GigaPevt addresses the challenge of building an intelligent medical assistant by combining multimodal sensing (facial video, audio, text) with large language models. It integrates specialized models for facial recognition, socio-demographic attributes, facial expressions, BMI estimation, and remote photoplethysmography, all feeding into a dialogue manager powered by a large language model with retrieval-augmented generation and chain-of-thought prompting. This approach enhances contextual awareness during patient interaction. In evaluations on the RuMedBench dataset, GigaPevt achieves 93.36% accuracy on question-answering and 71.59% on natural language inference, outperforming baseline models and demonstrating the benefit of multimodal context and advanced prompting.

## Method Summary
GigaPevt combines specialized medical models with a large language model to create a multimodal medical assistant. The system integrates facial recognition, socio-demographic analysis, facial expression detection, BMI estimation, and remote photoplethysmography into a dialogue manager using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The client-side handles face detection, text-to-speech, and automatic speech recognition, while the server-side manages model orchestration and dialog logic. The system was evaluated on the RuMedBench dataset for question-answering and natural language inference tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93.36% accuracy on question-answering tasks on RuMedBench dataset
- Achieves 71.59% accuracy on natural language inference tasks on RuMedBench dataset
- Outperforms baseline GigaChat model by 1.18% on question-answering task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion with facial video, audio, and text enables richer patient context than text-only systems.
- Mechanism: Specialized models (face detection, expression recognition, BMI estimation, rPPG) extract physiological and demographic signals that are integrated into the LLM's prompt context.
- Core assumption: Non-verbal cues provide clinically relevant information that improves diagnostic dialogue quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GigaPevt achieves 93.36% accuracy on question-answering and 71.59% on natural language inference, outperforming baseline models and demonstrating the benefit of multimodal context and advanced prompting."
  - [section 3] "The GigaPevt combines specialized medical models with the rich dialog capabilities of LLM, which account for broad context in visual, audio, and text modalities."
- Break condition: If the multimodal inputs are noisy or misaligned, the additional context could confuse the LLM rather than help it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) improves medical dialogue quality by grounding responses in structured knowledge.
- Mechanism: RAG retrieves relevant medical dialogues and questions to supplement the user's input; CoT prompts guide the LLM through multi-step reasoning before generating an answer.
- Core assumption: Medical queries often require reasoning over multiple facts; structured retrieval and explicit reasoning steps reduce hallucinations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "We resorted to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique... as it can help supplement the user's request with the found relevant information and the Chain of Thoughts (CoT)... as it was successfully used in challenging NLP scenarios."
  - [section 4.1] "The GigaPevt model with the RAG technique substantially outperforms GigaChat... by 1.18%."
- Break condition: If the retrieval corpus is incomplete or outdated, RAG could introduce irrelevant or incorrect facts, harming performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables continuous cardiovascular monitoring without wearable devices.
- Mechanism: POS algorithm processes subtle RGB changes in facial video to estimate pulse rate, RR intervals, and stress index.
- Core assumption: Facial skin perfusion correlates reliably with cardiac signals under varying lighting and motion conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) model allows extracting a photoplethysmography signal using a video of a user's face. Our system used the Plane Orthogonal-to-Skin (POS) algorithm... According to [Liu et al., 2023], this method has high accuracy, robustness, and speed."
- Break condition: High motion, poor lighting, or occlusions break the rPPG signal, leading to missing or inaccurate health indicators.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal data fusion in AI systems
  - Why needed here: GigaPevt integrates visual, audio, and text streams; understanding fusion techniques is critical to design and debug the pipeline.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between early fusion (concatenating features) and late fusion (independent models + ensemble) for multimodal medical data?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: RAG + CoT are central to GigaPevt's dialogue quality gains; engineers must know how to construct retrieval indices and craft effective prompts.
  - Quick check question: How does adding retrieved evidence to a prompt affect LLM hallucination rates in medical QA tasks?

- Concept: Remote photoplethysmography signal processing
  - Why needed here: rPPG is used for non-contact heart rate and stress estimation; understanding the POS algorithm helps tune preprocessing and evaluate robustness.
  - Quick check question: What preprocessing steps (e.g., face tracking, ROI selection) are most critical for stable rPPG under realistic conditions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Client (MediaPipe face detector, TTS, ASR) -> Server (Flask backend) -> Model Manager -> Specialized Models (face ID, socio-demographics, expression, BMI, rPPG) -> GP Dialog Logic (GigaChat + RAG + CoT)
- Critical path: Video frame -> Face detection -> Specialized models -> Feature aggregation -> LLM prompt -> Response generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latency vs. model accuracy: Lightweight face detector on client reduces server load but may miss faces in poor lighting.
  - Modality completeness vs. privacy: Continuous video capture improves health monitoring but raises privacy concerns.
  - RAG relevance vs. response speed: Larger retrieval indices improve grounding but increase latency.
- Failure signatures:
  - Missing or misdetected faces -> downstream models fail or use stale context.
  - ASR errors -> incorrect medical history leading to wrong recommendations.
  - RAG misses -> LLM defaults to generic answers without domain grounding.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run end-to-end latency test: frame capture -> all specialized models -> LLM response (target <2s for acceptable UX).
  2. Ablation study: compare accuracy with and without each specialized model (expression, BMI, rPPG) to quantify marginal gains.
  3. Stress test: evaluate rPPG robustness under varying lighting and motion (synthetic data + real user recordings).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single Russian-language medical dataset, unclear generalizability to other languages or clinical settings
- No real-world deployment metrics or patient safety outcomes reported
- Privacy implications of continuous facial video capture not discussed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Integration architecture is technically sound and performance gains over baseline are measurable
- **Medium confidence**: Clinical utility of multimodal context is supported by benchmarks but lacks real-world validation
- **Low confidence**: rPPG robustness under realistic clinical conditions assumed but not empirically tested

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation on non-Russian medical dialogue datasets to assess generalization
2. Perform ablation studies under stress conditions (low light, high motion, occlusions) to measure performance degradation
3. Implement privacy impact assessment quantifying data retention, transmission security, and re-identification risks
