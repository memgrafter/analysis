# FairML: A Julia Package for Fair Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01585
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01585
- Reference count: 13
- FairML.jl is a Julia package for fair classification in machine learning using preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing stages.

## Executive Summary
FairML.jl introduces a comprehensive framework for addressing unfairness in classification through a three-stage approach: preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing. The package implements resampling methods to balance data across sensitive feature categories, incorporates fairness constraints into logistic regression and support vector machine models, and optimizes classification cut-off values to improve fairness metrics. The framework demonstrates effectiveness in reducing disparate impact and disparate mistreatment while maintaining reasonable accuracy, particularly when combining preprocessing and post-processing with in-processing techniques.

## Method Summary
The framework addresses fairness through three complementary stages. The preprocessing stage uses resampling to reduce disparate impact by balancing data across sensitive feature categories. The in-processing stage incorporates fairness constraints directly into logistic regression and support vector machine models to mitigate both disparate impact and disparate mistreatment during training. The post-processing stage optimizes classification cut-off values to improve fairness metrics without significantly sacrificing accuracy. The package also handles mixed effects data by adapting fairness constraints for group-specific random effects, providing a flexible and modular approach to fair classification.

## Key Results
- The three-stage framework effectively reduces disparate impact, false negative rate difference, and false positive rate difference
- Combined preprocessing and post-processing with in-processing yields the best results for fairness metrics
- The package maintains reasonable accuracy while improving fairness across multiple datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The three-stage approach addresses fairness from multiple angles: preprocessing balances the training data to reduce inherent bias, in-processing enforces fairness constraints during model training to prevent discrimination from being learned, and post-processing optimizes decision thresholds to correct residual unfairness without retraining models.

## Foundational Learning
- Disparate impact: when a model's predictions disproportionately affect certain groups - needed to understand what fairness violations to address; check by examining group-wise prediction rates
- Resampling techniques: methods to balance class distributions across sensitive attributes - needed to prepare fair training data; check by comparing pre/post resampling group distributions
- Fairness constraints in optimization: mathematical formulations that penalize unfair predictions during training - needed to train inherently fair models; check by verifying constraint incorporation in objective functions
- Post-processing optimization: adjusting decision thresholds after training to achieve fairness - needed for last-mile fairness improvements; check by comparing fairness metrics before/after threshold adjustment
- Mixed effects modeling: statistical framework for handling hierarchical/grouped data - needed to apply fairness at appropriate levels; check by validating group-specific constraint application
- Logistic regression with fairness: extending linear classification with fairness-aware regularization - needed for interpretable fair models; check by examining coefficient changes with fairness constraints

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Preprocessing (resampling) -> In-processing (fair logistic regression/SVM) -> Post-processing (threshold optimization)

Critical path: Data preparation (handling sensitive attributes and outcomes) -> Model training with fairness constraints -> Fairness metric evaluation and threshold adjustment

Design tradeoffs: Binary vs. multi-class sensitive attributes (simplicity vs. generality), computational cost of resampling vs. fairness gains, strict fairness constraints vs. model performance

Failure signatures: Increased variance in predictions with resampling, convergence issues with strict fairness constraints, suboptimal fairness gains with poor initial data quality

First experiments:
1. Apply preprocessing only to a binary classification dataset and measure changes in disparate impact
2. Implement in-processing with fairness constraints on logistic regression and compare to unconstrained baseline
3. Combine preprocessing and post-processing on an SVM model and evaluate fairness-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Framework assumes binary sensitive attributes and outcome variables, limiting generalizability to multi-class settings
- Effectiveness depends heavily on original data quality and representativeness, with limited discussion of sampling bias implications
- Mixed effects data handling is mentioned but not extensively validated across different hierarchical structures
- Evaluation focuses on three fairness metrics without examining broader social or legal implications

## Confidence
High confidence in technical implementation and modular design in Julia
Medium confidence in numerical results showing effectiveness on specific datasets
Low confidence in generalizability to real-world deployment without additional diverse testing

## Next Checks
1. Test performance on multi-class sensitive attributes and outcome variables to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate behavior under different sampling strategies and data distributions to understand robustness
3. Implement additional fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity) and compare results across different definitions
