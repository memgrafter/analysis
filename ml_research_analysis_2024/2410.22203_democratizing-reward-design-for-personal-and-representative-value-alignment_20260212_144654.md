# Democratizing Reward Design for Personal and Representative Value-Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22203
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22203
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: System learns individual value definitions through language-model-based preference elicitation and constructs personalized reward models that can be used to align AI behaviour.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning AI agents with diverse human values, which often get suppressed when using standard aggregation methods. It introduces Interactive-Reflective Dialogue Alignment, a system that iteratively engages users in reflecting on and specifying their subjective value definitions through language-model-based preference elicitation. The system learns individual value definitions and constructs personalized reward models for aligning AI behavior. The evaluation involved two studies with 30 participants, one focusing on "respect" and the other on ethical decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The findings demonstrate diverse definitions of value-aligned behavior and show that the system can accurately capture each person's unique understanding. The approach enables personalized alignment and can inform more representative and interpretable collective alignment strategies.

## Method Summary
The system employs an iterative dialogue-based approach to capture individual value definitions. Users engage with a chat interface where they provide feedback on agent trajectories, explain their reasoning, and reflect on alternative perspectives. The system uses language models for in-context learning to build and refine a reward model based on user feedback. It employs active learning with uncertainty-based sampling to strategically select trajectories where the model is least confident. The process involves three main phases: feedback collection (trajectory assessment and rationale reflection), uncertainty reduction (active learning), and reward modeling. The system can learn both individualized and collective reward models, with the former capturing personal value definitions and the latter averaging across participants.

## Key Results
- The system accurately captured each person's unique understanding of value-aligned behavior in both studies.
- Individualized reward models outperformed collective models when participants showed low agreement in their value interpretations.
- The approach revealed 12 distinct behavioral features that participants used to explain respectful behavior, demonstrating the diversity of value definitions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured reflection enhances language-based reward modelling by engaging users in deliberate, analytical thinking about their value definitions.
- Mechanism: The system prompts users to reflect on their initial feedback by presenting hypotheses about their decision-making features and alternative perspectives. This reflection process engages System 2 thinking, helping users articulate and refine their values.
- Core assumption: Users can improve their ability to communicate preferences when guided through a structured reflection process that encourages them to consider alternative perspectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This system learns individual value definitions through language-model-based preference elicitation and constructs personalized reward models that can be used to align AI behaviour."
  - [section 2.2] "Reflection has several notable benefits that can help users clarify their understanding of their preferences and values."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on value alignment but don't specifically address reflection-based preference elicitation.
- Break condition: If users become frustrated with the reflection prompts or if the LLM-generated hypotheses consistently misrepresent user preferences, the reflection process may hinder rather than help value articulation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Individualized reward models outperform collective models when there is high diversity in value interpretations among participants.
- Mechanism: The system captures unique value definitions through personalized dialogue, creating reward models that are specifically tailored to each individual's preferences rather than averaging across a population.
- Core assumption: Value interpretations vary significantly between individuals and this diversity cannot be effectively captured through aggregation methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.0.1] "We observed a Fleiss' kappa value between all participants' labels on the 50 labelled trajectories of 𝜅 = 0.336, indicating 'fair' agreement among participants."
  - [section 5.0.4] "We found 12 behavioural features that participants used to explain whether they thought the agent was respectful."
  - [corpus] Moderate - papers discuss value alignment challenges but don't provide empirical evidence of individual vs. collective model performance differences.
- Break condition: When participants show high agreement in their value interpretations (as in Study 2 with kappa = 0.460), collective models may outperform individualized approaches.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Language-based reward models can effectively capture non-Markovian value judgments that consider temporal sequences rather than instantaneous states.
- Mechanism: By taking entire trajectories as input and using chain-of-thought reasoning, the language model can evaluate agent behavior over multiple time steps, capturing features that require historical context.
- Core assumption: Many human value judgments depend on sequences of actions and historical context rather than just the current state of the environment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.4.1] "An important finding from our study was the prevalence of non-Markovian features in participants' evaluations of respectful behaviour."
  - [section 3.2.4] "Since our LLM-based reward model receives a full trajectory as input and outputs a reward, it can deal with non-Markovian rewards."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on value alignment but don't specifically address non-Markovian reward modeling.
- Break condition: If the language model cannot effectively reason about temporal sequences or if users' value judgments are primarily based on instantaneous states rather than historical context.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: The system builds on RLHF techniques by using human feedback to train reward models, but extends it with personalized dialogue and reflection.
  - Quick check question: How does RLHF differ from traditional reinforcement learning in terms of reward function design?

- Concept: Preference Elicitation
  - Why needed here: The system uses both item-based and feature-based preference elicitation to gather user feedback on agent behavior and the features that drive their decisions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between item-based and feature-based preference elicitation, and when might each be more appropriate?

- Concept: Active Learning
  - Why needed here: The system employs uncertainty-based sampling to strategically select trajectories where the model is least confident, maximizing the information gained from each user interaction.
  - Quick check question: How does uncertainty-based sampling differ from random or diversity-based sampling in active learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feedback collection (trajectory assessment and rationale reflection) -> Uncertainty reduction (active learning) -> Reward modeling (in-context learning with LLMs)
- Critical path: User specifies value -> System shows diverse trajectories -> User provides feedback -> System prompts reflection -> User refines understanding -> System reduces uncertainty -> Final reward model generated
- Design tradeoffs: Language-based reward modeling vs. supervised learning (sample efficiency vs. performance with more data), individualized vs. collective models (personalization vs. data efficiency), reflection prompts vs. user fatigue (deeper understanding vs. engagement).
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on test set (model not capturing user preferences), low user engagement with reflection prompts (reflection process not valuable), high variance in user feature usage (difficulty in creating generalizable models).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance of IRDA system vs. baseline language model without reflection on a simple grid world environment.
  2. Test individualized vs. collective models with varying levels of preference diversity among participants.
  3. Evaluate the impact of reflection prompts on user ability to articulate their value definitions through pre/post surveys.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the diversity of value interpretations vary across different domains or types of AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that Study 1 (respect in a grid world) showed higher preference diversity than Study 2 (moral dilemmas in autonomous vehicles), suggesting context-dependent variation in value interpretations.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compared two specific domains. The extent and patterns of diversity across a broader range of AI applications remain unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring value diversity across multiple AI domains, including different types of tasks, user groups, and cultural contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between individualized and collective approaches for value alignment in multi-stakeholder AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that individualized reward models enable personalization while also providing a foundation for more representative collective alignment strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a framework for determining when to prioritize individual preferences versus collective ones, or how to make informed trade-offs in group contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research on the performance and fairness of different aggregation methods for individual reward models, considering factors like preference heterogeneity and the nature of the collective decision.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the Interactive-Reflective Dialogue Alignment system be extended to handle temporally extended scenarios and complex value judgments that span multiple time steps?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that participants often based their judgments on sequences of actions rather than single states, highlighting the prevalence of non-Markovian features in value judgments.
- Why unresolved: While the current system takes entire trajectories as input, it's unclear how to scale this approach to handle longer time horizons or more complex value judgments that require reasoning about multiple agents and their interactions over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies evaluating the system's performance on scenarios with longer time horizons and more complex value judgments, as well as research on methods for representing and reasoning about temporally extended value judgments.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (30 participants total) limits generalizability of findings to broader populations.
- Limited to two specific domains (respect in dialogue and autonomous vehicle ethics) raises questions about applicability to other AI systems.
- Heavy reliance on language models for hypothesis generation and reward modeling may not scale effectively to more complex tasks.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The observation that participants exhibit diverse value definitions and that individualized reward models can capture these differences more effectively than collective models in low-agreement scenarios.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that structured reflection improves users' ability to articulate their values, though evaluation focused on model performance rather than direct measurement of user articulation.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that language-based reward models can effectively handle non-Markovian features and temporal reasoning, as the paper identifies these features but doesn't provide systematic analysis of the language model's ability to capture temporal dependencies.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse participant pool (N > 100) across multiple value domains to assess whether the observed diversity in value definitions generalizes beyond the initial sample.
2. Design a controlled experiment that isolates temporal features from other aspects of agent behavior to systematically test the language model's ability to capture non-Markovian value judgments.
3. Implement the system on a more complex decision-making environment (e.g., multi-agent coordination task) to evaluate whether the language-based reward modeling approach scales effectively with task complexity.
