## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to dynamic planning in hierarchical active inference models, addressing the challenge of planning realistic actions in changing environments. The core method idea involves combining discrete decision-making with continuous motor control through a hybrid unit that integrates active inference with Bayesian model reduction. This allows for dynamic inference by comparing continuous trajectories with discrete intentions, enabling flexible adaptation to environmental changes. The primary result is a deep hybrid model that effectively simulates tool use tasks, demonstrating the ability to infer and plan in complex, dynamic scenarios while maintaining hierarchical relationships between the self, objects, and other agents.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach introduces a hybrid architecture that combines discrete decision-making with continuous motor control. At its core is a hybrid unit that integrates active inference with Bayesian model reduction, enabling dynamic inference by comparing continuous trajectories with discrete intentions. The model operates in a hierarchical structure, maintaining relationships between the self, objects, and other agents. This framework allows for efficient motor learning and advanced control over bodily movements, facilitating adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

## Key Results
- Hybrid unit effectively integrates active inference with Bayesian model reduction
- Model demonstrates ability to infer and plan in complex, dynamic scenarios
- Successfully simulates tool use tasks with efficient motor learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by bridging the gap between discrete decision-making and continuous motor control. Active inference provides a framework for predictive coding and action selection based on minimizing prediction errors, while Bayesian model reduction allows for efficient updating of beliefs in response to environmental changes. By combining these elements, the model can dynamically adjust its plans based on both high-level intentions and low-level sensory feedback. The hierarchical structure enables the system to maintain context at different levels of abstraction, from immediate motor control to long-term goal planning.

## Foundational Learning
- Active inference: Predictive coding framework for action and perception; needed for uncertainty handling; check by verifying free energy minimization
- Bayesian model reduction: Efficient updating of beliefs; needed for adapting to environmental changes; check by confirming belief updating speed
- Hierarchical modeling: Multi-level representation of self, objects, and agents; needed for context maintenance; check by tracing information flow between levels

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
- Sensory input -> Hierarchical encoder -> Hybrid unit -> Motor output
- External environment -> Object/agent models -> Self-model -> Intention module
- Continuous trajectory generator -> Discrete intention comparator -> Bayesian updater

Critical Path:
1. Sensory input processing through hierarchical encoder
2. Hybrid unit integration of active inference and Bayesian model reduction
3. Dynamic inference and planning based on continuous trajectories and discrete intentions
4. Motor output generation and action execution

Design Tradeoffs:
- Discrete vs. continuous action spaces: Balance between computational efficiency and action granularity
- Hierarchical depth: Tradeoff between context maintenance and computational complexity
- Model update frequency: Balance between responsiveness and computational load

Failure Signatures:
- Poor adaptation to environmental changes: Indicates issues with Bayesian model reduction
- Inconsistent action selection: Suggests problems in active inference integration
- Breakdown in hierarchical relationships: Points to encoding or information flow issues

Three First Experiments:
1. Test basic tool use in static environment
2. Introduce dynamic changes to evaluate adaptation capabilities
3. Vary task complexity to assess scalability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on specific hybrid architecture may limit adaptability to other action spaces
- Evaluation focused primarily on simulated tool use tasks
- Computational demands may pose scalability challenges for real-time applications

## Confidence
- Hybrid unit effectiveness in integrating active inference with Bayesian model reduction: Medium
- Model's ability to dynamically infer and plan in complex scenarios: Medium
- Efficient motor learning and advanced control over bodily movements: Low
- Potential applications in robotics and AI: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive testing across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks beyond tool use to assess the model's generalizability and robustness.
2. Perform a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art planning and control algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and performance metrics.
3. Implement the model on resource-constrained hardware to evaluate its scalability and real-time applicability in practical robotics scenarios.
