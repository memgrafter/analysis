core_contribution: This study adapts Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to
  measure alignment between human and artificial intelligence by eliciting pairwise
  similarity ratings for words and images. GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with
  human semantic judgments among tested models (Spearman r up to 0.758 for text, 0.606

# A Flexible Method for Behaviorally Measuring Alignment Between Human and Artificial Intelligence Using Representational Similarity Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00577
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: GPT-4o showed strongest alignment with human semantic judgments (Spearman r up to 0.758 for text, 0.606 for images), but no model adequately captured human inter-individual variability

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a behavioral method for quantifying alignment between human semantic representations and artificial intelligence using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). The approach elicits pairwise similarity ratings for words and images from both humans and LLMs, then correlates the resulting dissimilarity matrices to measure representational alignment. GPT-4o demonstrated the strongest alignment with human semantic judgments among tested models, particularly when using text descriptions rather than image processing. The method reveals that alignment can be improved through prompt engineering and shows that human ratings are more consistent across modalities than LLM ratings. However, current models fail to capture the inter-individual variability observed among human participants.

## Method Summary
The method uses pairwise similarity ratings to construct dissimilarity matrices (DSMs) for both human participants and LLMs. For each stimulus pair, raters assign similarity scores (0-100) which are converted to dissimilarities (100 minus rating). These ratings are organized into symmetrical DSMs, which are then correlated using Spearman rank correlation to quantify representational alignment. The approach includes simulated participant identities by assigning different names/honorifics to each model run, enabling measurement of inter-subject variability through intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Cross-modal RSA compares text-based human ratings with image-based SPOSE model distances to assess modality-agnostic conceptual representations.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with human semantic judgments among tested models (Spearman r up to 0.758 for text, 0.606 for images)
- Smaller models like Llama-3 and Phi-3 achieved good alignment with human ratings, outperforming GPT-3.5 despite being much smaller
- No model adequately captured the inter-individual variability observed among human participants
- Human ratings were more consistent across text and image modalities than cross-modal LLM ratings
- Alignment improved when using text descriptions instead of direct image processing (GPT-4-Vision)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RSA captures alignment by correlating distance matrices from human and AI similarity ratings
- Mechanism: Pairwise similarity ratings create behavioral dissimilarity matrices (DSMs) for each system; Spearman rank correlation between flattened DSMs quantifies representational alignment
- Core assumption: Distance in rating space reflects representational structure in the system
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RSA... uses pairwise similarity ratings to quantify alignment between AIs and humans"
  - [section] "ratings elicited by participants... comprise a behavioral distance metric... organized into a symmetrical matrix... correlated with one another to quantify the agreement of the pairwise ratings"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on RSA mechanism; weak anchor
- Break condition: If pairwise ratings do not reflect true representational structure (e.g., due to noise or systematic bias), RSA correlation will misrepresent alignment
