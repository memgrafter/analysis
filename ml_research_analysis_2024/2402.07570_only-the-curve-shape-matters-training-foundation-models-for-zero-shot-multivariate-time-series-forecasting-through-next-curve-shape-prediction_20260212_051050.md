# Only the Curve Shape Matters: Training Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Multivariate Time Series Forecasting through Next Curve Shape Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07570
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07570

## Executive Summary
This paper presents General Time Transformer (GTT), a foundation model for zero-shot multivariate time series forecasting that treats forecasting as a channel-wise next curve shape prediction problem. The model segments time series into non-overlapping curve shapes with unified numerical magnitude and uses an encoder-only architecture with temporal and channel attention stages. Pretrained on 200M diverse time series samples, GTT demonstrates superior zero-shot forecasting performance on unseen datasets, often surpassing state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and exhibits improved performance with fine-tuning while following scaling laws with respect to model size and training data scale.

## Method Summary
GTT introduces a novel approach to time series forecasting by treating it as a channel-wise next curve shape prediction problem. The method segments time series into non-overlapping curve shapes with unified numerical magnitude, allowing each time series to be represented as a sequence of these shapes. An encoder-only architecture with temporal and channel attention stages processes these representations. The model is pretrained on 200M diverse time series samples, enabling it to capture patterns across various domains and achieve strong zero-shot forecasting performance on unseen datasets.

## Key Results
- GTT achieves superior zero-shot forecasting performance on unseen datasets, often surpassing state-of-the-art supervised baselines
- The model demonstrates improved performance with fine-tuning on target datasets
- GTT follows a scaling law with respect to model size and training data scale

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core mechanism behind GTT's effectiveness lies in its curve shape representation approach. By segmenting time series into non-overlapping curve shapes with unified numerical magnitude, the model captures local temporal patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. The encoder-only architecture with temporal and channel attention stages allows the model to learn both within-channel temporal dependencies and cross-channel relationships simultaneously. This design enables the model to generalize across diverse time series patterns and achieve strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Curve Shape Representation**: Time series segmentation into non-overlapping curve shapes with unified numerical magnitude
  - Why needed: Enables capturing local temporal patterns while maintaining computational efficiency
  - Quick check: Verify that curve shapes capture meaningful patterns by visualizing segmentations

- **Encoder-Only Architecture**: Uses only encoder components for processing time series data
  - Why needed: Simplifies training and inference while maintaining strong performance
  - Quick check: Compare performance against decoder-encoder architectures on forecasting tasks

- **Temporal and Channel Attention**: Simultaneous attention across time and channels
  - Why needed: Captures both within-channel temporal dependencies and cross-channel relationships
  - Quick check: Validate attention weights focus on relevant temporal and cross-channel patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Time Series -> Curve Shape Segmentation -> Encoder (Temporal Attention -> Channel Attention) -> Next Curve Shape Prediction

**Critical Path**: The critical path for forecasting involves: (1) segmenting input time series into curve shapes, (2) encoding these shapes through temporal and channel attention layers, and (3) predicting the next curve shape in the sequence.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The curve shape representation trades off temporal resolution for computational efficiency and generalization. The encoder-only architecture simplifies the model but may limit certain sequence-to-sequence capabilities. The unified numerical magnitude assumption enables cross-domain generalization but may lose some dataset-specific scaling information.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include: (1) poor performance on datasets with long-range dependencies that span multiple curve shapes, (2) reduced accuracy when temporal patterns don't align well with fixed curve shape lengths, and (3) limitations in handling irregular time series patterns.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Evaluate zero-shot forecasting performance on diverse benchmark datasets (UQ and custom datasets)
2. Compare performance against state-of-the-art supervised baselines on the same datasets
3. Test fine-tuning performance on target datasets to measure adaptation capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The curve shape segmentation approach may not capture long-range dependencies that span multiple curve shapes
- The assumption that "only the curve shape matters" remains empirically supported but theoretically underexplored
- The superiority of the encoder-only architecture for all forecasting scenarios lacks comprehensive comparison with decoder-encoder alternatives

## Confidence

**High confidence** in zero-shot forecasting performance claims on benchmark datasets (UQ and custom evaluation), given extensive experimental validation across diverse datasets and baselines.

**Medium confidence** in the generalizability of curve shape representation across all time series domains, as results show robustness but edge cases remain unexamined.

**Low confidence** in the claimed superiority of the encoder-only architecture for all forecasting scenarios, given limited comparison with decoder-encoder architectures.

## Next Checks

1. Test GTT's performance on datasets with known long-range temporal dependencies to evaluate whether curve shape segmentation limits predictive capability.

2. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying curve shape length parameters to determine sensitivity to this hyperparameter and identify optimal configurations across different data types.

3. Compare GTT against state-of-the-art decoder-encoder architectures on sequence-to-sequence forecasting tasks where output sequences significantly differ from input sequences in length or structure.
