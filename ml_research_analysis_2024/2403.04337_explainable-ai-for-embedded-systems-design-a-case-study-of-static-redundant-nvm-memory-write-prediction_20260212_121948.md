# Explainable AI for Embedded Systems Design: A Case Study of Static Redundant NVM Memory Write Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04337
- Reference count: 32
- This paper demonstrates how eXplainable AI (XAI) can improve embedded system design by analyzing ML models for predicting static silent stores—redundant memory writes that can be eliminated to enhance performance and energy efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a two-step methodology for applying eXplainable AI (XAI) to embedded system design, using static silent store prediction as a case study. The approach combines ML model development with XAI techniques to make model decisions interpretable for embedded systems designers. Using SHAP and Anchors methods, the study identifies key static program features that influence silent store predictions, such as zero constant writes and loop induction variables. The research demonstrates that XAI can provide consistent explanations aligned with known causes of silent stores, offering valuable insights into ML model behavior in embedded contexts.

## Method Summary
The study uses a multi-layer neural network (5 dense layers: 64→32→16→8→1 neurons) with ReLU activations and sigmoid output, trained with Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4) for 3000 epochs with early stopping. The dataset contains 89K static silent stores from 222 programs, with 127 original features reduced to 76 after correlation analysis. SHAP (using deep explainer) and Anchors (precision ≥0.95) are applied to interpret model predictions. The methodology focuses on binary classification (silent/noisy store) with precision and recall as key metrics, addressing the imbalanced dataset challenge.

## Key Results
- SHAP and Anchors XAI methods provide consistent explanations aligned with known causes of silent stores
- Key static program features identified include operations writing zero constants to memory and loop induction variables
- Combined SHAP values for feature vectors show reasonable correlation with actual silent store ratios
- Balanced precision-recall trade-off is crucial for effective explainability in embedded system contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SHAP values reliably identify influential static program features by computing Shapley values that average marginal contributions across all feature coalitions. This works when the model's prediction function is smooth enough for meaningful averaging.

### Mechanism 2
Anchors validates local explanations by generating predicates that maintain specified precision thresholds over feature space neighborhoods. This is effective when the precision-defined neighborhood is large enough to capture generalizable feature interactions.

### Mechanism 3
Combined SHAP values for feature vectors correlate with actual silent store ratios by averaging SHAP values across instances containing each vector. This approximation is valid when SHAP aggregation represents true causal effects.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Binary classification evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1)
  - Why needed here: The dataset is imbalanced, so accuracy alone would be misleading; precision and recall reveal model behavior on silent vs. noisy stores.
  - Quick check question: If a model has precision 0.6 and recall 0.29 on silent store prediction, what does that say about its false positive and false negative rates?

- **Concept:** Feature importance and interaction effects in ML models
  - Why needed here: Silent store prediction depends on combinations of static features; understanding isolated vs. combined effects is key to interpretability.
  - Quick check question: Why might a feature that rarely occurs alone still be important when combined with others?

- **Concept:** Model-agnostic vs. model-specific XAI methods
  - Why needed here: The study uses SHAP and Anchors, which work with any ML model, allowing flexibility in model choice.
  - Quick check question: What is a key advantage of model-agnostic XAI over model-specific methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Data pipeline → Feature extraction → ML model training → XAI explanation generation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Load and clean dataset
  2. Train NN or RF model with balanced precision/recall
  3. Compute SHAP values for global feature importance
  4. Validate with Anchors predicates

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Precision vs. recall: Higher precision reduces false positives but may miss true silent stores; tradeoff depends on application cost.
  - SHAP vs. Anchors: SHAP gives global importance but is computationally heavy; Anchors gives local, interpretable rules but may oversimplify.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low SHAP-Recall correlation → Dataset imbalance or model bias
  - Anchors predicates with many terms → Feature space too complex for simple rules
  - High variance in combined SHAP values → Small sample sizes for feature vectors

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train NN with default hyperparameters, measure precision/recall, plot SHAP beeswarm for top 10 features.
  2. Generate Anchors predicates for 10 correctly predicted silent stores, check precision threshold compliance.
  3. Compute combined SHAP values for all 3-feature vectors, plot against actual silent store ratios, compute correlation coefficient.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the trade-off between precision and recall in ML models for silent store prediction be optimized to balance explainability and code optimization goals?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses the challenge of balancing precision and recall in ML models for silent store prediction, particularly in the context of an imbalanced dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights that models with higher precision than recall are better suited for explainability but does not provide a clear methodology for optimizing this trade-off in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different ML models and their precision-recall trade-offs, along with their effectiveness in explaining silent store predictions and optimizing code performance.

### Open Question 2
How can XAI methods be adapted to handle the inherent imbalance in datasets for static silent store prediction?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the dataset used is imbalanced, which affects the performance and explainability of ML models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the impact of dataset imbalance on model performance, it does not propose specific techniques to address this issue within the context of XAI.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of techniques to preprocess or augment imbalanced datasets, ensuring that XAI methods can provide accurate and meaningful explanations.

### Open Question 3
Can XAI methods be extended to explain ML models for other embedded system design problems beyond silent store prediction?
- Basis in paper: The paper suggests that XAI could be relevant for various embedded system design tasks, such as predicting execution time, power consumption, and security.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on static silent store prediction as a case study and does not explore the application of XAI to other embedded system design problems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies and experiments applying XAI methods to different embedded system design problems, demonstrating their effectiveness and adaptability.

## Limitations
- The dataset is relatively small (89K instances) and highly imbalanced (90% noisy stores), which may affect generalizability of XAI explanations.
- The study focuses only on static program features, potentially missing runtime dynamics that influence silent store behavior.
- Confidence in generalizability to other embedded system contexts is medium given the specific nature of the dataset and problem domain.

## Confidence
- SHAP and Anchors providing consistent explanations: High (results align with known silent store causes)
- Generalizability to other embedded system contexts: Medium (specific dataset and problem domain)
- Effectiveness of two-step methodology: Medium (based on single case study)

## Next Checks
1. Test the XAI methods on a larger, more diverse dataset to assess generalizability.
2. Apply the methodology to a different embedded system design problem to evaluate its broader applicability.
3. Conduct a user study with embedded systems designers to validate the practical utility and interpretability of the XAI explanations in a real-world design context.
