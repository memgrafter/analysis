# Challenging the Performance-Interpretability Trade-off: An Evaluation of Interpretable Machine Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.14429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14429
- Reference count: 40
- This study shows interpretable GAMs can match or exceed black-box models' predictive accuracy while maintaining full transparency.

## Executive Summary
This study challenges the common assumption that interpretable machine learning models must sacrifice predictive performance for transparency. Through systematic comparison of seven generalized additive models (GAMs) against seven black-box models using twenty benchmark datasets, the authors demonstrate that interpretable models can achieve competitive accuracy. The evaluation shows that GAMs like EBM, IGANN, and GAMI-Net not only match but in some cases exceed the performance of black-box models while providing exact visual explanations of their decision-making process.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates seven GAM implementations against seven commonly used black-box models across twenty benchmark datasets. The experimental pipeline includes default hyperparameter settings, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation for all models. Performance is measured using AUROC for classification and RMSE for regression, while interpretability is assessed through visual shape plots and six evaluation criteria. The comprehensive study runs 68,500 model configurations to provide statistically significant comparisons.

## Key Results
- Interpretable GAMs achieve competitive predictive performance while maintaining full transparency
- EBM outperforms most black-box models on average, challenging the performance-interpretability trade-off assumption
- GAMs show minimal improvement from hyperparameter tuning compared to black-box models
- Visual shape plots provide exact, not approximate, explanations of model behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GAMs can match or exceed black-box models' predictive accuracy while remaining interpretable.
- Mechanism: GAMs use additive structure with non-linear shape functions per feature, enabling flexible modeling without loss of interpretability.
- Core assumption: The dataset is tabular and contains meaningful features that can be individually modeled.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "interpretable GAMs, particularly EBM, IGANN, and GAMI-Net, achieve competitive predictive performance while maintaining full transparency, with EBM even outperforming most black-box models on average."
  - [section 2.2] "GAMs are a type of ML model that allows for the estimation of non-linear relationships between predictor variables... They are an extension of linear models, in which the linearity assumption is relaxed, allowing for more flexible and powerful modeling capabilities."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations on this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If features are highly correlated or if complex feature interactions dominate the target relationship, the additive assumption may break down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hyperparameter tuning provides minimal performance gains for GAMs compared to black-box models.
- Mechanism: GAMs have inherent structural constraints that make them robust to hyperparameter variations.
- Core assumption: Default hyperparameter configurations for GAMs are already well-tuned for general performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "The majority of GAMs, including EBM, P-Splines, TP-Splines, GAMI-Net, and ExNN, generally show little or no improvement" in the tuned setting.
  - [section 4.1] "In contrast, the largest differences can be noted for NAM... shows improvements in almost all datasets, indicating that NAM is very tuning-intensive."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations on this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the dataset has very specific characteristics that require careful hyperparameter selection, tuning may become more critical.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Visual shape plots provide exact, not approximate, explanations of model behavior.
- Mechanism: GAMs' additive structure allows decomposition into individual feature effects that sum to produce predictions.
- Core assumption: The model is trained on a representative dataset and the shape functions accurately capture the underlying relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "GAMs are based on the structure of additive index models... each feature can possibly have a partial contribution to all corresponding shape functions."
  - [section 4.2] "the shape plots are not just an approximate explanation of relevant relationships, but an exact description of how the intrinsically interpretable model computes a prediction."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations on this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the dataset contains many complex interactions between features, the additive assumption may lead to misleading visualizations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Additive modeling and feature decomposition
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GAMs separate feature effects is crucial for interpreting their visualizations and performance.
  - Quick check question: How does the additive structure of GAMs differ from linear models, and what advantage does this provide?

- Concept: Hyperparameter tuning and its impact on different model families
  - Why needed here: Understanding why GAMs require less tuning than black-box models helps in model selection and deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why do some models (like NAM) show significant improvements with tuning while others (like EBM) do not?

- Concept: Interpretability criteria and their trade-offs
  - Why needed here: Evaluating models based on interpretability requires understanding the different dimensions and their relative importance.
  - Quick check question: How would the ranking of models change if monotonicity was weighted more heavily than visualizability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing -> Model implementations -> Evaluation pipeline -> Interpretability assessment

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess dataset
  2. Train models with default hyperparameters
  3. Perform cross-validation and calculate metrics
  4. Tune hyperparameters and repeat steps 2-3
  5. Generate and analyze shape plots
  6. Evaluate interpretability using criteria

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. model diversity: Including many models increases runtime but provides comprehensive comparison
  - Interpretability vs. performance: Some highly interpretable models may sacrifice some predictive accuracy
  - Default vs. tuned hyperparameters: Default settings provide fair baseline but may miss some performance gains

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence in TP-Splines for some datasets
  - Overfitting in NAM leading to jagged shape functions
  - NAM and ExNN producing non-interpretable visualizations
  - Random forest and XGBoost requiring extensive tuning for optimal performance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run all models on a small, well-understood dataset (e.g., college dataset) to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare shape plots of a simple GAM (e.g., P-Splines) with a linear model to understand visual differences
  3. Test hyperparameter tuning impact by comparing default vs. tuned configurations on a medium-sized dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focused primarily on tabular data, leaving questions about GAMs' performance on unstructured data types
- Computational efficiency differences between GAMs and black-box models during training and inference were not fully explored
- While demonstrating competitive performance, the study doesn't address model robustness to noisy or corrupted features

## Confidence
- High confidence: GAMs can achieve competitive predictive accuracy on tabular datasets
- Medium confidence: Visual interpretability of GAMs provides exact rather than approximate explanations
- Medium confidence: Hyperparameter tuning provides minimal performance gains for most GAMs

## Next Checks
1. Test GAM performance on non-tabular datasets (images, text) to assess generalizability
2. Compare training/inference times across models to evaluate computational efficiency
3. Evaluate model robustness to noisy or corrupted features to test stability assumptions
