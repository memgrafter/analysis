## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16682
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16682
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Comprehensive review of nearly 100 papers on federated generative models (2019-2024), highlighting GAN dominance in clinical applications, emerging superiority of Diffusion models, and open challenges in scalability and privacy

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews nearly 100 papers on federated generative models from 2019-2024, focusing on their integration with federated learning methods and privacy considerations. The review reveals that federated GANs have dominated clinical applications with well-developed privacy and integrity evaluation methods, while recently proposed diffusion-based federated models show superior performance in convergence and communication costs compared to GAN-based approaches. The paper identifies scalability and cross-device federated learning as persistent open challenges, with privacy and integrity in tabular data-based models and non-GAN-based federated learning requiring further research. Emerging hot topics include one-shot federated learning, pre-trained diffusion models, and large language model-based generative federated learning.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of nearly 100 papers published between 2019-2024, comparing them across multiple dimensions including generative model methods, federated learning algorithms, data types, privacy measures, evaluation methods, number of devices, and code availability. The review focuses on three main categories: GAN-based federated learning, diffusion/VAE-based federated learning, and other federated generative model applications. The methodology involves extracting key information from each paper to create comprehensive comparison tables and synthesize findings to identify trends, state-of-the-art models, privacy considerations, and open research challenges in federated generative models.

## Key Results
- Federated GANs have garnered significant attention with numerous clinical applications and well-developed privacy/integrity evaluation methods
- Recently proposed Diffusion-based Federated Models outperform GAN-based models in convergence and communication costs
- Scalability and cross-device FL remain open challenges for federated generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Generative models in FL protect privacy by keeping raw data local while enabling model training
- Mechanism: Clients train local generative models on their private data and only share model updates (parameters, gradients) rather than raw data with the server
- Core assumption: Model updates contain less sensitive information than raw data, and aggregation of multiple updates further obscures individual contributions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed systems that allow clients to train models on their data and only share models instead of local data."
  - [section 2.1] "Instead of sharing (possibly sensitive) training data with a central server, each client (a.k.a participant), such as a smartphone or computer, train local models on their individual datasets and only share model updates."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus papers discussing this specific mechanism
- Break condition: Model updates contain sufficient information to reconstruct sensitive data (adversarial attacks), or differential privacy guarantees are insufficient

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Federated generative models enable synthetic data generation without centralizing sensitive datasets
- Mechanism: Multiple clients collaboratively train generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models) in a distributed fashion, creating synthetic data that preserves statistical properties while protecting individual privacy
- Core assumption: Collaborative training across diverse datasets creates more robust generative models than any single client could produce, while keeping data distributed
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Generative Models are designed to learn the distribution of a dataset and generate new data samples that are similar to the original data."
  - [section 5.1] "Many prior works have tried integrating generative models into Federated Learning setups to protect sensitive data and increase model performance by preventing data sharing with central servers."
  - [corpus] Assumption: The corpus papers like "New Money: A Systematic Review of Synthetic Data Generation for Finance" likely discuss similar privacy-preserving synthetic data generation approaches
- Break condition: Poor data quality or distribution mismatch between clients leads to low-quality synthetic data that fails to preserve useful statistical properties

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Federated generative models address non-IID data challenges through collaborative learning and data augmentation
- Mechanism: Clients with non-identical data distributions collaborate to train generative models that can synthesize data representative of the overall distribution, improving model performance on heterogeneous datasets
- Core assumption: The generative model can learn to represent the union of all client data distributions even when individual client datasets are non-IID
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using Federated Learning and Generative Models together can be susceptible to attacks, and designing the optimal architecture remains challenging."
  - [section 5.1] "The idea of combining GANs with FL to address non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data challenges is extensive and varied."
  - [corpus] Assumption: Papers like "Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Systematic Review" likely discuss mechanisms for handling non-IID data in federated settings
- Break condition: Extreme non-IID conditions where generative models cannot adequately represent the combined data distribution, leading to biased or poor-quality synthetic data

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning fundamentals (client-server architecture, model aggregation, communication rounds)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how FL works is essential for grasping how generative models can be integrated into this framework
  - Quick check question: What are the four main steps in the training process of a FL system according to the paper?

- Concept: Generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models) and their training objectives
  - Why needed here: Different generative model architectures have different properties and requirements when federated
  - Quick check question: What are the two neural networks involved in a GAN, and what are their respective goals?

- Concept: Differential privacy and its application in federated settings
  - Why needed here: Privacy is a key motivation for using federated generative models, and understanding DP guarantees is crucial
  - Quick check question: What are the two parameters (ε and δ) that control the privacy-utility tradeoff in differential privacy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Client-side generative models (GAN generator/discriminator, VAE encoder/decoder, or Diffusion Model components) → Local training → Model update sharing → Server-side aggregation → Global model broadcast → Repeat until convergence
- Critical path: Data → Local generative model training → Model parameter/gradient updates → Secure aggregation → Global model synchronization → Synthetic data generation
- Design tradeoffs: Privacy vs utility (stronger privacy mechanisms like DP may reduce synthetic data quality), communication efficiency vs model accuracy (more frequent updates may improve accuracy but increase communication costs), computational burden on clients vs central server capabilities
- Failure signatures: Poor synthetic data quality (indicates training issues or extreme non-IID conditions), privacy leakage through model updates (indicates insufficient privacy protection), communication bottlenecks (indicates scalability issues)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic federated GAN with FedAvg aggregation on a simple dataset (MNIST) to verify the framework works
  2. Test privacy protection by attempting to reconstruct client data from shared model updates with and without DP
  3. Evaluate synthetic data quality by training a classifier on synthetic data and testing on real data across different non-IID data partitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can federated generative models be optimized for IoT devices with limited computational resources?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that only GANs are currently used for IoT devices and notes that making other generative models more efficient for these environments remains an open problem.
- Why unresolved: Existing generative models are computationally intensive, and lightweight alternatives suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices have not been adequately developed or evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and experimental validation of lightweight federated generative models (e.g., optimized VAEs or diffusion models) that demonstrate efficient performance on IoT devices with limited memory and processing power.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective defense mechanisms against privacy and integrity attacks in federated diffusion models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that privacy and integrity attacks in diffusion-based federated learning models remain unresolved and require additional research.
- Why unresolved: While diffusion models show promise in federated learning, their vulnerability to attacks like membership inference and model poisoning has not been thoroughly investigated or addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive security evaluations demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed defense mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy, secure aggregation) against various attacks on federated diffusion models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does scalability impact the performance and robustness of federated generative models as the number of clients increases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies scalability analysis and consideration as open problems among generative-based federated learning models, particularly for federated VAEs and diffusion models.
- Why unresolved: Most existing research focuses on small-scale setups, and the impact of increasing client numbers on model convergence, communication efficiency, and robustness is not well understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of federated generative models across different scales of client participation, identifying bottlenecks and proposing scalable solutions.

## Limitations
- Paper selection methodology not fully specified, creating uncertainty about review comprehensiveness
- Limited empirical validation of claimed performance improvements between GAN and Diffusion-based approaches
- Most claims rely on literature review rather than original experiments
- Cross-device scalability assessments are theoretical rather than empirically validated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: GANs remain dominant in clinical applications with established privacy evaluation methods
- **Medium confidence**: Diffusion models show promise for better convergence and communication efficiency, but real-world deployment data is limited
- **Low confidence**: Claims about one-shot FL and LLM-based approaches being "emerging hot topics" lack sufficient supporting evidence in the review

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical comparison of communication costs between federated GAN and Diffusion models across varying device counts
2. Implement privacy attack experiments to quantify information leakage from model updates in both GAN and Diffusion-based FL
3. Test scalability limits by deploying federated generative models across 1000+ heterogeneous devices with varying data distributions
