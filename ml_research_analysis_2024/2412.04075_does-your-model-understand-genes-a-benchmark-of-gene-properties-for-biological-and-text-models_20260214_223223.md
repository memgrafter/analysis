# Does your model understand genes? A benchmark of gene properties for biological and text models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.04075
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04075
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Text-based models and protein language models generally outperform expression-based models on genomic and regulatory tasks, while expression-based models excel in localization tasks

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating gene embeddings from diverse models—text-based, biological, and classical—on gene property prediction tasks. The benchmark covers five categories of gene properties (genomic, regulatory, localization, biological processes, and protein properties) using curated databases. Models are evaluated using simple predictive models and cross-validation, revealing systematic performance differences across task families. The benchmark enables broad comparison of deep learning models and supports improvement in biological understanding and therapeutic discovery.

## Method Summary
The benchmark compiles hundreds of gene properties from curated databases across five categories: genomic properties, regulatory functions, localization, biological processes, and protein properties. For each category, binary, multi-label, and multi-class classification tasks are defined. Gene embeddings from various models—including text-based models, single-cell RNA foundation models, DNA and protein sequence models, and classical baselines—are extracted and used to train simple predictive models (logistic/linear regression) via 5-fold cross-validation. Performance is measured using AUC-ROC, F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Text-based models and protein language models generally outperform expression-based models on genomic and regulatory tasks
- Expression-based models excel in localization tasks compared to other model types
- The benchmark reveals systematic performance differences across task families, enabling broad evaluation of diverse deep learning models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by providing a standardized framework for comparing gene embeddings across diverse model types using consistent task definitions and evaluation protocols. By using simple predictive models and cross-validation, it isolates the quality of the embeddings themselves rather than model-specific architectures. The multi-category approach captures different aspects of gene function, revealing where different model types excel.

## Foundational Learning

**Gene embeddings**: Vector representations of genes learned from various data sources (text, sequences, expression). *Why needed*: Provide a common representation space for comparing different model types. *Quick check*: Verify embedding dimensionality matches model specifications.

**Cross-validation**: Repeated partitioning of data into training and testing sets. *Why needed*: Provides robust performance estimates and reduces overfitting risk. *Quick check*: Ensure stratification maintains class balance across folds.

**Gene property databases**: Curated sources like Reactome, Human Protein Atlas, OpenTargets, UniProt. *Why needed*: Provide ground truth labels for benchmark tasks. *Quick check*: Verify dataset completeness and consistency across sources.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data sources → Property extraction → Task definition → Model embedding extraction → Predictive model training → Cross-validation → Performance metrics

**Critical path**: Embedding extraction → Predictive model training → Cross-validation → Performance evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Simple predictive models (linear/logistic regression) vs. complex architectures - favors fair comparison over model capacity
- Fixed embedding extraction vs. fine-tuning - prioritizes zero-shot evaluation over potential performance gains
- Multi-category tasks vs. focused tasks - provides comprehensive evaluation at cost of complexity

**Failure signatures**: 
- Embedding extraction failures indicate model incompatibility or missing dependencies
- Cross-validation errors suggest class imbalance or data formatting issues
- Poor performance may indicate insufficient training data or inappropriate model-task pairing

**First experiments**:
1. Test embedding extraction for each model type to verify compatibility
2. Run cross-validation on a single task to validate pipeline functionality
3. Compare performance of simple vs. MLP predictive models on representative tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How much do differences in training data composition across models influence the observed performance gaps on specific task families? The paper notes performance differences between models with different training data but doesn't quantify the relative influence of data composition versus architecture.

**Open Question 2**: Can task-specific fine-tuning of embeddings substantially improve performance compared to the zero-shot approach used in the benchmark? The benchmark uses frozen embeddings, leaving the potential gains from fine-tuning unexplored.

**Open Question 3**: To what extent does the lexical bias in gene descriptions (over-representation of well-studied genes) limit the generalizability of text-based models to understudied genes? The benchmark aggregates performance without stratifying by annotation depth or study frequency.

## Limitations
- Embedding extraction reproducibility may vary across model types, particularly for specialized biological models
- Reliance on publicly available datasets introduces potential variability in data quality and completeness
- Simple linear/logistic regression models may not fully capture the capabilities of more sophisticated architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the benchmark design and task categorization framework
- **Medium confidence** in the cross-model performance rankings due to potential embedding extraction variability
- **Medium confidence** in the generalizability of findings across different biological contexts

## Next Checks
1. Test embedding extraction reproducibility across multiple runs for each model type to establish stability metrics
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the predictive model complexity to assess impact on performance rankings
3. Validate benchmark results using an independent, held-out dataset not included in the original task compilation to test generalization
