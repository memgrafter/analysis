## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for handling missing modalities in Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks, specifically addressing scenarios where either audio or visual data is absent during inference. The proposed approach employs a Relation-aware Missing Modal (RMM) generator to recall missing modality information by leveraging relationships between available modalities, followed by an Audio-Visual Relation-aware (AVR) diffusion model to enhance feature representations through cross-modal knowledge. Experimental results on MUSIC-AVQA and AVQA datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy when modalities are missing, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The framework addresses missing modalities through a two-step process: first, the RMM generator creates pseudo features for missing modalities using a slot-based architecture that identifies relevant slots from available modalities through addressing vectors; second, the AVR diffusion model enhances the combined real and pseudo features through iterative noise reduction that leverages cross-modal relationships. The system is trained end-to-end with three loss functions: RMMR loss for the RMM generator, AVE loss for the AVR diffusion model, and standard cross-entropy loss for the AVQA backbone. The complete framework is evaluated on two benchmark datasets (MUSIC-AVQA and AVQA) with missing modality ratios of 30%, 50%, and 70%.

## Key Results
- The proposed framework achieves significant accuracy improvements on MUSIC-AVQA and AVQA datasets when either audio or visual modalities are missing
- Performance gains are consistent across all question types (counting, comparison, average, existence, location, and temporal)
- The two-step approach of pseudo feature generation followed by diffusion-based enhancement outperforms both baseline AVQA models and ablations using only one component

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The RMM generator can effectively recall missing modality information by leveraging relationships between available modalities
- Mechanism: Uses slot-based architecture where each modality is represented by L learnable parameter vectors (slots). When a modality is missing, addressing vectors identify which slots from available modalities are most correlated with the missing modality, then generate pseudo features through weighted summation
- Core assumption: Relationships between modalities contain sufficient information to reconstruct missing modality features
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "RMM generator generates pseudo features for missing modalities by leveraging relationships between available modalities"; [section] "Each generators consists of L slots denoted as G = {Gv j ,Ga j ,Gt j}L j=1... Each slot contains data that serves as a reminder of the corresponding modality"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The AVR diffusion model enhances feature representations by leveraging cross-modal knowledge through iterative noise reduction
- Mechanism: Takes pseudo feature from RMM generator and real feature from available modality, concatenates them, and passes through diffusion process where forward process adds noise and reverse process removes noise to learn enhanced representations
- Core assumption: Diffusion process can effectively learn to enhance features by leveraging complementary information between modalities
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "AVR diffusion model with Audio-Visual Enhancing (AVE) loss to further enhance audio-visual features by leveraging the relationships and shared cues between the audio-visual modalities"; [section] "The real feature of the available modality (visual) and the pseudo feature of the missing modality (audio) are combined and passed into the AVR diffusion model"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combination of RMM generator and AVR diffusion model creates a two-step process that mimics human trimodal interpretation
- Mechanism: First step recalls missing modality information by associating available modalities; second step enhances features from both pseudo and real modalities by leveraging mutual cues; ensures enhanced features from both modalities contribute to accurate predictions
- Core assumption: Human cognitive processes of trimodal interpretation can be effectively modeled through these two computational steps
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This approach ensures that the enhanced features from both modalities contribute to more accurate and robust predictions"; [section] "Our novelty consists of two key steps: (1) using trimodal relations to handle missing modalities and (2) enhancing features with complementary audio-visual relations"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and their forward/reverse processes
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the AVR diffusion model works to enhance features through iterative noise reduction
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between the forward process (adding noise) and reverse process (removing noise) in diffusion models?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and addressing vectors
  - Why needed here: The RMM generator uses addressing vectors to determine which slots are most relevant for generating pseudo features
  - Quick check question: How does the addressing vector computation (using softmax over similarity scores) help identify relevant slots for modality recall?

- Concept: Multi-modal feature fusion and representation learning
  - Why needed here: Both RMM and AVR models need to effectively combine and represent information from different modalities
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in representing and fusing information from audio, visual, and text modalities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input encoders (visual, audio, text) → RMM Generator → Pseudo feature generation → Real feature + Pseudo feature → AVR Diffusion model → Enhanced features → Enhanced features + question feature → AVQA Backbone → Answer prediction

- Critical path: The flow from input modalities through RMM generator to AVR diffusion and finally to the AVQA backbone represents the critical path for handling missing modalities

- Design tradeoffs: Using diffusion models adds computational complexity but provides better feature enhancement; slot-based architecture in RMM allows flexible modality recall but requires tuning the number of slots; combining pseudo and real features leverages cross-modal knowledge but may introduce noise

- Failure signatures: Poor pseudo feature quality (high RMMR loss); AVR diffusion failing to improve features (AVE loss not
