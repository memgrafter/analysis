# DAM: Towards A Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.17880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17880
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Foundation model for time series forecasting that generalizes across domains

## Executive Summary
DAM introduces a foundation model for time series forecasting that achieves strong generalization across diverse domains. The model uses a transformer backbone with a novel history sampling regime (HSR) that employs a long-tail distribution over time steps, enabling efficient global temporal perspective while maintaining focus on recent history. DAM outputs continuous basis function coefficients rather than fixed-length forecasts, allowing predictions at any horizon without retraining. The model is trained on 25 diverse time series datasets and demonstrates superior performance on 39 of 80 dataset-horizon combinations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
DAM is a transformer-based foundation model for time series forecasting that takes irregularly sampled historical data and outputs a continuous function of time via basis coefficients. The model employs a history sampling regime (HSR) using a long-tail distribution over time steps to efficiently capture both distant and recent temporal dynamics. Rather than producing fixed-length forecasts, DAM generates coefficients for a composition of sine and cosine basis functions at various frequencies, creating a continuous function that can be evaluated at any horizon. The model is trained on 25 diverse datasets simultaneously, forcing it to learn universal temporal representations that transfer effectively to held-out datasets without additional training.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models on 39 of 80 dataset-horizon combinations
- Excels at zero-shot transfer, achieving strong performance on 8 held-out datasets without retraining
- Demonstrates capability for very-long-term forecasting and imputation tasks
- Provides interpretability through basis composition and attention mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DAM achieves generalization across domains by using a flexible transformer backbone with randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution.
- Mechanism: The history sampling regime (HSR) allows the model to access both distant and recent past data efficiently, giving it a global perspective of temporal dynamics while retaining focus on recent history. This enables learning patterns across datasets with different sampling rates and patterns.
- Core assumption: Randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution provide sufficient information to learn universal temporal patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history"
  - [section] "The DAM uses a long-tail distribution over time steps, x = t/R, where R is the sample resolution (e.g., hourly). We call this the history sampling regime (HSR)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct comparisons to other sampling methods in related papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DAM generalizes well by outputting continuous basis function coefficients instead of fixed-length forecasts.
- Mechanism: The model outputs coefficients for a composition of sine and cosine functions at various frequencies, creating a continuous function of time that can be evaluated at any horizon without retraining. This eliminates the need for pre-determined forecast horizons.
- Core assumption: Temporal patterns in time series can be effectively represented by a composition of sinusoidal basis functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons"
  - [section] "The DAM forecasts using basis functions... This function is not constrained by a pre-determined horizon, thus enabling longer term forecasts"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - related papers focus on transformers but not continuous basis function output.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DAM achieves strong zero-shot transfer by training on a diverse set of 25 datasets simultaneously.
- Mechanism: Training on multiple datasets with different characteristics (resolutions, patterns, domains) forces the model to learn robust, universal temporal representations that transfer to unseen datasets without additional training.
- Core assumption: Temporal patterns have sufficient commonality across diverse domains to enable transfer learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer"
  - [section] "We trained the single DAM used in this paper on 25 publicly available datasets, 10 of which are common benchmark datasets"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - related papers don't report zero-shot transfer results on held-out datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Transformers can process irregularly sampled data through self-attention mechanisms, which don't require fixed input lengths or regular sampling.
  - Quick check question: How does the multi-head self-attention mechanism handle irregularly sampled time series data?

- Concept: Basis function decomposition
  - Why needed here: Continuous basis functions allow forecasting at any horizon without retraining, unlike fixed-length output methods.
  - Quick check question: Why are sine and cosine functions chosen as basis functions instead of learned basis functions?

- Concept: History sampling regimes
  - Why needed here: Enables efficient access to both recent and distant past data, providing global temporal perspective while maintaining focus on recent history.
  - Quick check question: How does the long-tail distribution affect the model's ability to capture long-term temporal patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Transformer backbone (4 layers, 4 heads) → Time-Value token embedding → Cross-attention with basis tokens → Feed-forward blocks → ToME reduction → Basis coefficient collapse → Affine adjustment
- Critical path: Input → HSR sampling → Embedding → Transformer layers → Basis coefficient generation → Continuous function evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Flexibility vs. training complexity (training on 25 datasets vs. specializing on one), continuous output vs. computational cost of basis evaluation, random sampling vs. fixed-length context
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on datasets with sharp changes (spikes), overfitting on small datasets, failure to capture long-term trends, high training cost compared to specialized models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test DAM on a single dataset with varying context sizes and HSR parameters to understand sensitivity
  2. Compare continuous basis function output vs. fixed-length output on the same dataset
  3. Evaluate zero-shot transfer performance on a held-out dataset from the same domain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DAM's performance scale with increased model size and training across diverse datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the DAM benefits from training across diverse datasets and suggests further scaling of the model architecture.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides preliminary scaling law results from training on a single dataset (ETTh1) with limited model sizes. A comprehensive study across multiple datasets and model scales is needed to fully understand the DAM's scaling properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting extensive experiments with varying model sizes and training on multiple diverse datasets, measuring performance on a range of forecasting tasks, and comparing the results to other foundation models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the DAM be extended to incorporate multivariate time series forecasting while maintaining its generalizability and performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on univariate forecasting and acknowledges the potential benefits of cross-variable information but does not explore this aspect.
- Why unresolved: The current DAM design does not explicitly handle multivariate data, and it is unclear how to incorporate cross-variable information without compromising the model's generalizability and performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating multivariate variants of the DAM, comparing their performance to existing multivariate forecasting methods, and assessing their ability to generalize across diverse datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the DAM be further improved to handle time series with sharp changes (spikes) and irregular sampling patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the DAM struggles with sharp changes and irregular sampling, suggesting that representing such data with basis functions is challenging.
- Why unresolved: The current DAM architecture relies on basis function composition, which may not be well-suited for capturing abrupt changes and handling highly irregular sampling patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Exploring alternative forecasting mechanisms that can better handle sharp changes and irregular sampling, such as incorporating neural networks or adaptive basis functions, and evaluating their performance on datasets with challenging characteristics.

## Limitations

- Limited evidence comparing the long-tail history sampling regime against alternative sampling strategies
- Lack of detailed architectural specifications, particularly for the ToME reduction step
- Potential limitations in capturing complex temporal patterns with sinusoidal basis functions
- No evidence of performance on time series with sharp discontinuities or highly irregular sampling

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core architecture design (transformer + basis function output) is technically sound and the reported zero-shot transfer performance on 8 held-out datasets provides strong evidence for the model's generalization capability. The continuous basis function output mechanism is well-justified and clearly explained.

**Medium Confidence:** The superiority claims over state-of-the-art models (39 of 80 dataset-horizon combinations) are supported by the experimental results, but the evaluation methodology lacks detail about hyperparameter tuning and comparison fairness. The paper doesn't provide confidence intervals or statistical significance tests for the performance differences.

**Low Confidence:** The claims about interpretability through basis composition and attention mechanisms are weakly supported. The paper mentions interpretability but doesn't provide concrete examples or quantitative measures of how the basis coefficients or attention weights relate to interpretable temporal patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on History Sampling:** Implement and compare DAM with alternative history sampling strategies (uniform, exponential, fixed-length context) on the same datasets to quantify the contribution of the long-tail HSR to performance. This would validate whether the claimed "efficient global perspective" is truly necessary or if simpler sampling methods suffice.

2. **Basis Function Capacity Analysis:** Systematically vary the number and types of basis functions (e.g., add learned basis functions, test different frequency ranges) and measure the impact on forecasting accuracy, particularly for datasets with different temporal characteristics. This would test the assumption that sinusoidal bases are sufficient for capturing universal temporal patterns.

3. **Zero-Shot Transfer Robustness:** Evaluate DAM's zero-shot transfer performance across domain gaps by testing on datasets from domains not represented in the training set (e.g., financial data if training was on sensor/medical data). This would validate whether the model truly learns universal temporal representations or is overfitting to domain-specific patterns.
