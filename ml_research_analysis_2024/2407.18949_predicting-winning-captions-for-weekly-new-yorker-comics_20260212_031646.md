# Predicting Winning Captions for Weekly New Yorker Cartoons

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.18949
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18949
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: GPT-4V in a 5-shot setting performs best at generating winning New Yorker cartoon captions according to SS-SCORE metric

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using vision transformer encoder-decoder models to generate captions for New Yorker cartoons, aiming to emulate the wit and humor of winning entries in the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest. The authors propose several baseline models, including CLIP-GPT2, LLaVA-NeXT, and GPT-4V, and evaluate them using automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, as well as manual quality assessment. The results show that GPT-4V in a 5-shot setting performs best according to their SS-SCORE metric, which measures the proportion of times a model generates the best caption compared to human-written captions. The authors discuss the challenges of using automated metrics for this task and provide qualitative examples of generated captions.

## Method Summary
The authors use the New Yorker Caption Contest dataset from Hugging Face (approximately 2.6K entries) and implement multiple vision encoder-decoder models including CLIP-GPT2, LLaVA-NeXT, and GPT-4V with various training settings (0-shot, 5-shot, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and finetuning with QLoRA). They evaluate models using automated metrics (BLEU and ROUGE) and manual SS-SCORE assessment that measures the proportion of times a model generates the best caption compared to human-written captions. The approach involves encoding cartoons into embeddings using vision transformers and decoding these into captions using language models with appropriate prompt engineering techniques.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V in 5-shot setting achieves the highest SS-SCORE, outperforming other approaches including LLaVA-NeXT with Chain-of-Thought prompting
- CLIP-GPT2 models struggle to capture semantic content despite mimicking the correct tone and style, likely due to CLIP being trained on natural images rather than cartoons
- Automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE show poor correlation with caption quality for this task, highlighting the need for manual evaluation
- Metadata inclusion improves caption quality for some models, suggesting that additional context helps with humor understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: GPT-4V with 5-shot prompting achieves the best SS-SCORE because it leverages its large knowledge base and few-shot learning capability to adapt to the specific style of humorous captions.
- **Mechanism**: The model is presented with 5 examples of cartoon-caption pairs, allowing it to learn the format, tone, and style expected in high-quality captions. This few-shot learning approach enables GPT-4V to generate captions that are more aligned with human-written captions.
- **Core assumption**: GPT-4V has been pre-trained on a vast amount of data that includes cultural references and humor, making it capable of understanding and generating witty captions.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "GPT-4V in a 5-shot setting performs best according to their SS-SCORE metric"; [section 6.2]: "GPT-4V in the 5-shot setting performs the best, with GPT-4V in the Chain-of-Thought setting performing second best."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: LLaVA-NeXT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting generates improved captions by breaking down the reasoning process into intermediate steps, encouraging more sophisticated decision-making.
- **Mechanism**: The CoT prompt guides the model through a series of reasoning steps, starting with detailed image description, identifying uncanny aspects, generating multiple caption concepts, and refining them. This structured approach helps the model produce more contextually relevant and humorous captions.
- **Core assumption**: LLaVA-NeXT can effectively utilize the intermediate reasoning steps to enhance its caption generation, especially when it has prior knowledge of the task.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a prompt engineering technique designed to enhance language models' performance on logic, calculation, and decision-making tasks by structuring the input prompt to simulate human reasoning."; [section 4.2.3]: "We provide LLaVA-NeXT with a series of intermediate reasoning steps that encourages more sophisticated decision-making."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: CLIP-GPT2 models struggle with cartoon captioning because CLIP was trained on natural images and may not capture the proper image features needed for decoding humorous captions.
- **Mechanism**: The CLIP vision model encodes the cartoon into a multi-modal embedding space, which GPT2 then decodes into a caption. However, since CLIP was trained on natural images, it may not effectively encode the stylized representations and abstract concepts found in cartoons, leading to poor caption generation.
- **Core assumption**: The image features extracted by CLIP are not suitable for generating captions that require understanding of humor and cultural nuances specific to cartoons.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 6.3]: "We note that although the CLIP-GPT2 models are able to mimic the correct tone and style of high-quality captions, they are unable to capture the semantic content of the image. This is likely because the CLIP vision model was trained on natural images, and these cartoons do not exhibit the same color distribution as those natural images."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image recognition
  - **Why needed here**: ViTs are used to encode cartoons into embeddings that can be decoded into captions. Understanding how ViTs work is crucial for implementing and troubleshooting the encoding-decoding pipeline.
  - **Quick check question**: How do ViTs differ from traditional convolutional neural networks in handling image data?

- **Concept**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
  - **Why needed here**: CoT prompting is used to guide the model through a series of reasoning steps, improving its ability to generate humorous and contextually relevant captions.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key components of a CoT prompt, and how do they contribute to better reasoning in language models?

- **Concept**: Few-shot learning
  - **Why needed here**: Few-shot learning allows models like GPT-4V to adapt to the specific style of cartoon captioning by learning from a small number of examples.
  - **Quick check question**: How does few-shot learning differ from zero-shot learning, and what are the advantages of using few-shot learning in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Cartoon image -> Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder -> Embedding -> Language model (GPT2/LLaVA-NeXT/GPT-4V) with prompt -> Generated caption

- **Critical path**: 1. Encode cartoon image using ViT 2. Generate caption using language decoder with appropriate prompt 3. Evaluate generated caption against human-written captions using SS-SCORE

- **Design tradeoffs**: Model size vs. computational resources (larger models like GPT-4V perform better but require more resources); Automated metrics vs. manual evaluation (BLEU and ROUGE may not capture humor, necessitating manual SS-SCORE assessment); Prompt complexity vs. model performance (more complex prompts like CoT may improve quality but require careful design)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor SS-SCORE despite high BLEU/ROUGE scores (automated metrics may not align with human judgment of humor); Generated captions that describe images literally (model may not grasp the task's requirement for humor and wit); Inconsistent performance across different cartoons (model may struggle with cultural nuances or abstract concepts)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Test CLIP-GPT2 with and without metadata to observe the impact on caption quality 2. Implement and compare LLaVA-NeXT with 0-shot, 5-shot, and CoT prompting settings 3. Evaluate GPT-4V in both 5-shot and CoT settings to determine which approach yields better SS-SCORE

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the performance of vision transformer models compare to traditional CNN-based models for generating humorous captions for New Yorker cartoons?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper discusses the use of vision transformers for this task but does not compare their performance to CNN-based models.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on vision transformer models and does not explore or benchmark against CNN-based approaches.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conduct experiments using CNN-based models for the same task and compare their performance metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE scores, SS-SCORE) to those of the vision transformer models presented in the paper.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the impact of different types of metadata (e.g., image descriptions, explanations of humor, entities) on the quality of generated captions?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions experimenting with different metadata combinations but does not provide a detailed analysis of their individual impacts.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper combines all metadata in some experiments but does not isolate and analyze the effect of each type of metadata separately.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Design experiments that systematically vary the types of metadata provided to the model and measure the resulting changes in caption quality using the SS-SCORE metric and qualitative analysis.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the complexity of the cartoon (e.g., number of characters, scene complexity, cultural references) affect the ability of models to generate appropriate captions?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper discusses the challenges of generating captions for cartoons but does not analyze how different cartoon complexities impact model performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide a detailed breakdown of cartoon complexities or analyze their relationship with caption generation performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Categorize cartoons in the dataset based on complexity factors and analyze model performance across these categories using metrics like SS-SCORE and qualitative assessments.

## Limitations
- Reliance on automated metrics (BLEU and ROUGE) that may not adequately capture the nuanced quality of humorous captions
- Small dataset size (approximately 2.6K entries) potentially limiting generalizability
- Lack of exploration of temporal dynamics of humor evolution and cultural context changes

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The observation that GPT-4V with 5-shot prompting outperforms other approaches is well-supported by both quantitative metrics and manual evaluation.

**Medium Confidence**: The explanation for CLIP-GPT2's poor performance due to mismatch between natural image training and cartoon domain is plausible but could benefit from direct empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting for LLaVA-NeXT is based on theoretical reasoning rather than robust empirical comparison, as the results show mixed performance.

## Next Checks

1. **Direct Domain Adaptation Test**: Fine-tune the CLIP vision encoder on a subset of cartoon images and retrain the CLIP-GPT2 model to empirically validate whether the domain mismatch hypothesis explains the poor performance.

2. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Evaluate model performance on cartoon caption contests from different cultural contexts (e.g., international versions) to assess whether the models capture culturally-specific humor or rely too heavily on American cultural references.

3. **Temporal Consistency Analysis**: Track caption quality across different time periods within the New Yorker Caption Contest dataset to determine if models capture evolving humor trends or if their performance degrades over time as humor styles change.
