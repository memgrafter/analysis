- Introduces document accessibility measures to IR by adapting transportation planning concepts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the concept of document accessibility from transportation planning into information retrieval (IR), defining it as a measure of the potential for documents to be retrieved given an IR system. The authors draw an analogy between physical space and information space, proposing two accessibility measures: a cumulative opportunity measure that counts retrievable documents within a rank cutoff, and a gravity-based measure that weights documents by their reciprocal rank. These measures provide a higher-level evaluation of IR systems, focusing on document retrievability rather than traditional effectiveness metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes applying transportation accessibility concepts to information retrieval by measuring the potential for documents to be retrieved within a given IR system. Two specific measures are introduced: cumulative opportunity accessibility, which counts all retrievable documents within a rank cutoff, and gravity-based accessibility, which weights documents by their reciprocal rank position. The framework treats information space similarly to physical space, where documents are locations and retrieval is the transportation mechanism. These measures aim to provide system administrators with tools to evaluate and improve document visibility and detect biases in access patterns.

## Key Results
- Introduced document accessibility as a novel evaluation framework for IR systems
- Proposed cumulative opportunity measure counting retrievable documents within rank cutoff
- Developed gravity-based measure weighting documents by reciprocal rank, analogous to expected search length

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by treating information retrieval as a spatial accessibility problem, where documents are locations in information space and retrieval systems are transportation networks. By applying transportation planning concepts, the measures capture the potential for documents to be accessed rather than just the quality of retrieved results. The gravity-based measure specifically leverages the inverse relationship between rank position and document importance, similar to how distance affects accessibility in physical space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Space Theory**: Understanding how documents exist in abstract space rather than physical space; needed to map transportation concepts to IR; quick check: verify documents can be positioned based on similarity metrics
- **Reciprocal Rank Weighting**: The inverse relationship between rank position and document importance; needed to weight accessibility scores; quick check: confirm weight decreases as rank increases
- **Transportation Accessibility Metrics**: Cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures from urban planning; needed as conceptual foundation; quick check: validate these measures work in physical space first
- **IR System Evaluation**: Traditional metrics like precision, recall, nDCG; needed as comparison baseline; quick check: ensure accessibility complements rather than replaces existing metrics
- **Document Retrieval Potential**: The concept of measuring retrievability rather than just retrieval quality; needed for the core contribution; quick check: verify measures capture system-wide accessibility
- **Bias Detection in IR**: Methods for identifying systematic access inequalities; needed for practical application; quick check: test on systems with known access biases

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> IR System -> Document Corpus -> Accessibility Measures (Cumulative Opportunity, Gravity-Based) -> System Evaluation

**Critical Path**: User query enters system → documents are retrieved and ranked → accessibility measures calculate potential access → results inform system design and bias detection

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes system-level evaluation over individual query performance, trading granular effectiveness metrics for broader accessibility insights. This approach sacrifices immediate user satisfaction measurement for long-term system optimization and bias detection capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: If accessibility scores remain consistently low across diverse query sets, this indicates fundamental system design flaws. If certain document types show systematically lower accessibility, this reveals potential biases in ranking algorithms or collection coverage issues.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply accessibility measures to a standard IR test collection and compare results with traditional effectiveness metrics
2. Test measures on synthetic datasets with known access biases to validate bias detection capabilities
3. Evaluate computational performance and scalability on progressively larger document collections

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lacks empirical validation with real-world datasets and comparison to established IR metrics
- Does not account for user satisfaction or task completion, focusing solely on document retrievability
- No analysis of computational complexity or scalability for large-scale systems

## Confidence

High confidence: The conceptual framework of applying transportation planning accessibility concepts to IR is well-founded and provides a novel perspective on system evaluation.

Medium confidence: The mathematical formulation of cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures is sound, but their practical utility remains unproven.

Low confidence: Claims about detecting and addressing system biases through accessibility measures lack empirical support and validation.

## Next Checks

1. Implement the proposed accessibility measures on standard IR test collections (e.g., TREC datasets) and compare results with traditional metrics like precision, recall, and nDCG to establish baseline performance.

2. Conduct user studies to validate whether higher accessibility scores correlate with improved user satisfaction and task completion rates across different information-seeking scenarios.

3. Test the scalability of accessibility measures on large-scale IR systems with varying document collections and query distributions to assess computational feasibility and practical applicability.
