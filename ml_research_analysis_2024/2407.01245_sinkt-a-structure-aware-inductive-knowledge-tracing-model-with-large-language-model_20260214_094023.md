# SINKT: A Structure-Aware Inductive Knowledge Tracing Model with Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01245
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01245
- Authors: Lingyue Fu; Hao Guan; Kounianhua Du; Jianghao Lin; Wei Xia; Weinan Zhang; Ruiming Tang; Yasheng Wang; Yong Yu

- Primary result: Outperforms 12 existing transductive KT models on four real-world datasets with state-of-the-art accuracy and AUC metrics

## Executive Summary
SINKT is a knowledge tracing model that addresses the limitations of traditional approaches by incorporating large language models (LLMs) to handle both transductive and inductive knowledge tracing tasks. The model uses LLMs to encode semantic and structural information of questions and concepts, enabling it to handle unseen questions and overcome cold-start problems. SINKT constructs a heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions, uses graph attention networks for structural encoding, and employs a GRU-based student state encoder to model learning behavior. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT outperforms existing models and effectively handles the inductive KT task, which is a first in the field.

## Method Summary
SINKT uses LLMs to construct a concept-question heterogeneous graph and encode semantic information of questions and concepts. The model employs a multi-layer graph attention network to encode structural information and a GRU-based student state encoder to model sequential learning behavior. The response predictor combines student state, question representation, and concept representation to predict student responses. SINKT is trained using cross-entropy loss and can handle both transductive and inductive knowledge tracing tasks by leveraging the semantic and structural information provided by LLMs.

## Key Results
- SINKT outperforms 12 existing transductive KT models on four real-world datasets
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with accuracy and AUC metrics
- Effectively handles the inductive KT task, predicting responses for unseen questions
- Demonstrates ability to overcome data sparsity and cold-start problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Using large language models to encode semantic and structural information enables handling unseen questions and concepts.
- **Mechanism**: SINKT replaces traditional ID embeddings with LLM-generated semantic representations of questions and concepts. By encoding these as rich vector representations and incorporating structural relationships via a concept-question heterogeneous graph, the model can generalize to new questions without requiring interaction history.
- **Core assumption**: Semantic and structural information captured by LLMs sufficiently captures the knowledge required to predict student performance on unseen questions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "SINKT addresses the challenges of data sparsity and cold-start problems by incorporating semantic and structural information of questions and concepts through large language models, rather than relying on ID embeddings."
  - [section]: "SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for concepts and questions. Then, we use a Pretrained Language Model (PLM) to encode semantic information of questions and concepts instead of training ID embeddings."
- **Break condition**: If the semantic and structural information provided by LLMs is not sufficiently comprehensive or accurate for representing unseen questions, the model will fail to generalize effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Incorporating structural information through graph attention networks improves prediction accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: SINKT constructs a heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions, then uses graph attention networks to encode the structural relationships. This allows the model to capture complex dependencies between concepts and questions that are not apparent from interaction data alone.
- **Core assumption**: The structural relationships between concepts and questions, as captured by the graph, are relevant and useful for predicting student performance.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for concepts and questions."
  - [section]: "To encode such structural information, we carefully design a multi-layer heterogeneous graph encoder... The three types of edges in the heterogeneous graph G, i.e., concept-question, concept-concept, and question-concept, are considered by SINKT."
- **Break condition**: If the structural relationships in the graph are noisy or irrelevant, the model's performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The student state encoder effectively captures sequential learning behavior and concept-level forgetting.
- **Mechanism**: SINKT uses a GRU-based student state encoder that takes concept-level representations of student interactions and models the sequential dynamics of learning. This captures both knowledge acquisition and forgetting patterns.
- **Core assumption**: The sequential patterns in student interactions, when represented at the concept level, contain sufficient information about knowledge states and forgetting.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "To model learning history of students, we use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture the sequential learning behavior... Hidden state h_t ∈ R^d represents the knowledge state of the student at time step t."
- **Break condition**: If the concept-level representations do not adequately capture the nuances of student knowledge states, or if the GRU fails to model the sequential dynamics effectively, the predictions will be inaccurate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs)
  - **Why needed here**: SINKT uses GAT layers to encode structural information from the concept-question heterogeneous graph. Understanding how GNNs work is crucial for grasping how the model aggregates information from neighboring nodes.
  - **Quick check question**: How does a GAT layer differ from a standard GNN layer in terms of how it aggregates information from neighbors?

- **Concept**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their role in knowledge representation
  - **Why needed here**: SINKT leverages LLMs to generate semantic representations of questions and concepts, and to create the concept-question graph. Understanding how LLMs can be used for knowledge representation is key to understanding SINKT's approach.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the advantages of using LLMs for semantic encoding compared to traditional embedding methods?

- **Concept**: Knowledge Tracing (KT) and the challenges of transductive vs. inductive learning
  - **Why needed here**: SINKT is a KT model that addresses both transductive and inductive learning tasks. Understanding the differences between these tasks and the challenges they present is essential for understanding SINKT's contributions.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the key difference between transductive and inductive knowledge tracing, and why is inductive learning more challenging?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLM Pipeline -> Textual Information Encoder (TIEnc) -> Structural Information Encoder (SIEnc) -> Student State Encoder -> Response Predictor
- **Critical path**: The critical path for making a prediction is: input question and student history → TIEnc and SIEnc encode semantic and structural information → Student State Encoder processes learning history → Response Predictor combines all information to make final prediction.
- **Design tradeoffs**: SINKT trades off model complexity and training time for improved generalization to unseen questions. Using LLMs for semantic encoding and graph construction adds computational overhead but enables handling cold-start problems.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on unseen questions, overfitting to training data, slow convergence during training, or sensitivity to hyperparameters.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify that the TIEnc correctly encodes semantic information by checking the similarity of representations for semantically similar questions/concepts.
  2. Test the SIEnc's ability to capture structural information by evaluating the model's performance with different graph structures.
  3. Validate the Student State Encoder by analyzing the hidden states to ensure they capture relevant sequential patterns in student learning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM-generated graphs and semantic encodings introduces potential variability based on LLM quality and prompt engineering
- Model complexity may limit scalability to larger educational datasets
- Limited comparison with only 12 existing models, may not represent the full landscape of knowledge tracing approaches

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: SINKT's effectiveness on transductive KT tasks (verified through comparison with 12 existing models)
- **Medium confidence**: SINKT's ability to handle inductive KT tasks (limited by lack of established baselines in this emerging area)
- **Medium confidence**: The architectural design choices (graph construction, semantic encoding) due to reasonable theoretical foundations but limited ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies removing LLM components to quantify their contribution to performance gains
2. Test SINKT on additional educational datasets with varying characteristics to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate model performance with different LLM configurations and prompts to establish robustness to LLM variability
