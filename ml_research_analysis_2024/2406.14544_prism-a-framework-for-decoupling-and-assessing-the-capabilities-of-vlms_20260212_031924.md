- This paper introduces Prism, a framework that decouples visual perception and reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Prism, a framework that decouples visual perception and reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Prism separates VLM-based perception from LLM-based reasoning, enabling systematic evaluation of each component. It achieves competitive performance on the MMStar benchmark, matching or exceeding VLMs 10x larger, when using a 2B LLaVA visual captioner with GPT-3.5. The framework also reveals that small-scale VLMs often perform well in perception but are bottlenecked by limited reasoning capacity. By modularizing these processes, Prism provides insights for VLM optimization and serves as an efficient, cost-effective solution for vision-language tasks.

## Method Summary
Prism implements a modular architecture that decouples visual perception from reasoning in VLMs. The framework uses a small VLM (2B parameters) to generate detailed visual captions, which are then fed to a large language model (GPT-3.5) for reasoning. This separation allows for systematic evaluation of each component's capabilities and enables the use of more powerful reasoning models without requiring proportional increases in VLM size. The modular design provides flexibility in component selection and allows for targeted improvements in either perception or reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Prism achieves competitive performance on the MMStar benchmark, matching or exceeding VLMs 10x larger
- When using a 2B LLaVA visual captioner with GPT-3.5, Prism demonstrates efficient performance
- The framework reveals that small-scale VLMs often perform well in perception but are bottlenecked by limited reasoning capacity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The decoupling approach works by leveraging the strengths of specialized models. Small VLMs excel at extracting visual features and generating descriptive captions, while large language models are superior at complex reasoning tasks. By separating these functions, Prism allows each component to operate within its optimal capacity. The VLM focuses on accurate visual perception without the burden of complex reasoning, while the LLM handles reasoning using the detailed visual information provided. This division of labor enables efficient use of computational resources and allows for scaling each component independently based on task requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Image -> Small VLM (2B) -> Detailed Captions -> Large LLM (GPT-3.5) -> Answer

Critical Path: The critical path involves the VLM processing the image and generating detailed captions, which are then passed to the LLM for reasoning and answer generation. The quality of captions directly impacts the LLM's ability to reason effectively.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model Size vs. Performance: Using a small VLM reduces computational costs but relies heavily on the LLM's reasoning capabilities
- Caption Detail vs. Processing Time: More detailed captions improve reasoning accuracy but increase processing time and token usage
- Component Independence vs. Integration: Decoupling allows for independent optimization but may lose some benefits of end-to-end training

Failure Signatures:
- Poor caption quality leading to incorrect reasoning
- LLM misinterpreting visual information from captions
- Latency issues due to sequential processing of VLM and LLM
- Token limit exceeded when generating very detailed captions

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test Prism with different VLM sizes (e.g., 1B, 4B, 7B) to determine the optimal balance between perception quality and computational efficiency
2. Evaluate the impact of caption detail on reasoning performance by varying the maximum token limit for caption generation
3. Compare Prism's performance with monolithic VLMs across multiple benchmarks to validate generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The evaluation is limited to a single benchmark (MMStar), raising questions about generalizability to other datasets and task types
- The framework's effectiveness with VLMs larger than 2B parameters is not explored, leaving uncertainty about scalability
- Cost-effectiveness claims are based on relative performance rather than absolute computational costs, which would provide a more complete picture of efficiency gains

## Confidence

High confidence in the technical implementation of the decoupling framework and its ability to separate visual perception from reasoning tasks. Medium confidence in the performance claims on MMStar benchmark, as results are promising but limited to one dataset. Low confidence in the generalizability of findings to other benchmarks and VLM scales, as comprehensive cross-dataset validation is not provided.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate Prism's performance across multiple vision-language benchmarks (e.g., VQA, GQA, NLVR2) to assess generalizability beyond MMStar.

2. Test the framework with larger VLM variants (5B, 10B parameters) to determine if the decoupling approach maintains efficiency gains at scale.

3. Conduct a comprehensive cost analysis comparing absolute computational requirements and inference times between monolithic VLMs and the Prism modular approach across different hardware configurations.
