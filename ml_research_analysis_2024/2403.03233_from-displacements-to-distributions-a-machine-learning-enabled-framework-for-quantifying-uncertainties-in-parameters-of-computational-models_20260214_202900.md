# From Displacements to Distributions: A Machine-Learning Enabled Framework for Quantifying Uncertainties in Parameters of Computational Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03233
- Authors: Taylor Roper; Harri Hakula; Troy Butler
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Combines data-consistent inversion and LUQ to quantify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, reducing total variation metrics from 0.808 to 0.160–0.161 in synthetic examples.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework that bridges machine learning and data-consistent inversion to quantify uncertainties in computational model parameters. By combining Learning Uncertain Quantities (LUQ) with data-consistent (DC) inversion, the authors transform noisy spatial or spatio-temporal measurements into distributions over model parameters. The framework employs robust RBF-based filtering for spatial data, leverages RKHS theory for analyzing learned quantities of interest (QoI) maps, and introduces an iterative DC inversion approach that updates parameter distributions as new data becomes available over time.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates LUQ and DC inversion to handle both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in model parameters. LUQ maps noisy measurements to learned QoI, while DC inversion updates prior distributions based on these QoI to produce posterior distributions. The method introduces RBF-based filtering for spatial data, provides RKHS theoretical foundations for analyzing learned QoI maps, and develops a numerical sufficiency test for filtered data. The iterative DC inversion framework allows for sequential updating as new measurements arrive, making it suitable for time-evolving systems.

## Key Results
- Total variation (TV) metrics improved from 0.808 to 0.390, and further to 0.160–0.161 using iterative updates
- RBF-based filtering demonstrated robustness for spatial data processing
- Framework successfully applied to randomly generated waves and shells of revolution (wind turbine towers and trommel screens)
- RKHS analysis provides theoretical justification for learned QoI map smoothness and stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by first learning a QoI map from noisy measurements using machine learning techniques, then using this map within a data-consistent inversion framework to update prior distributions of model parameters. The RBF filtering ensures spatial data is appropriately processed before learning, while the RKHS framework provides theoretical guarantees on the learned maps' properties. The iterative nature allows the system to incorporate new information over time, refining parameter distributions progressively.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Data-Consistent Inversion**: Framework for updating prior distributions using QoI from noisy measurements
   - Why needed: Traditional Bayesian inversion can be computationally expensive and may not handle epistemic uncertainties well
   - Quick check: Verify that DC inversion produces distributions that are consistent with observed QoI

2. **Learning Uncertain Quantities (LUQ)**: Machine learning approach to map measurements to QoI
   - Why needed: Direct measurement-to-parameter mapping is often impossible due to noise and complexity
   - Quick check: Ensure learned QoI maps have good generalization to unseen data

3. **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Filtering**: Technique for processing spatial data
   - Why needed: Spatial measurements often contain noise that must be filtered before analysis
   - Quick check: Verify filter preserves important spatial features while removing noise

4. **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: Mathematical framework for analyzing function spaces
   - Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for analyzing learned QoI maps
   - Quick check: Confirm learned maps satisfy RKHS smoothness conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Measurements -> RBF Filtering -> LUQ Learning -> QoI Map -> DC Inversion -> Parameter Distribution -> (Optional) Iterative Update

Critical Path: RBF Filtering → LUQ Learning → DC Inversion → Parameter Distribution

Design Tradeoffs:
- Filter complexity vs. preservation of spatial features
- Model complexity vs. interpretability of learned QoI maps
- Computational cost vs. accuracy of posterior distributions
- Iteration frequency vs. convergence stability

Failure Signatures:
- Poor TV metric improvements indicate issues with either LUQ learning or DC inversion
- Filter artifacts suggest RBF parameters need adjustment
- Unstable iterative updates indicate insufficient regularization or model mismatch

First Experiments:
1. Apply RBF filtering to synthetic noisy spatial data and verify feature preservation
2. Train LUQ model on filtered data and evaluate QoI map accuracy on test set
3. Run DC inversion with learned QoI and compare posterior distribution to ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework validation limited to synthetic data; real-world experimental validation is absent
- Robustness of RBF filtering claims based on theoretical analysis rather than empirical testing with actual measurement noise
- RKHS-based analysis lacks empirical benchmarks for complex physical systems
- No comparison with established uncertainty quantification methods like Bayesian inversion or ensemble Kalman filters

## Confidence
- Algorithmic contributions (LUQ, DC inversion, RBF filtering): Medium
- Theoretical foundations (RKHS analysis): High
- Practical applicability to real-world problems: Low
- Computational scalability for large systems: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to experimental datasets (e.g., structural health monitoring data) to verify filter performance under realistic noise conditions
2. Compare TV metric improvements against state-of-the-art Bayesian inversion or ensemble Kalman filter approaches on benchmark problems
3. Test the iterative DC inversion on a real-time monitoring scenario with streaming data to assess computational scalability and accuracy decay over multiple updates
