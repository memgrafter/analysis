# ViewFusion: Learning Composable Diffusion Models for Novel View Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.02906
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02906
- Authors: Bernard Spiegl; Andrea Perin; Stéphane Deny; Alexander Ilin
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves LPIPS scores of 0.033 (variable input) and 0.053 (single view) on NMR dataset using composable diffusion models without pose information

## Executive Summary
ViewFusion introduces a novel approach for novel view synthesis that leverages composable diffusion models to combine information from multiple input views. The key innovation is a learned weighting mechanism that adaptively focuses on the most informative input views for each region of the target view, enabling the model to operate without pose information while maintaining flexibility across variable numbers of inputs. Unlike previous methods, ViewFusion can handle pose-free views, generalizes across multiple scenes and object classes, and generates plausible views even when input is severely underdetermined. The method demonstrates competitive performance on the Neural 3D Mesh Renderer dataset while offering significant improvements in flexibility and applicability to real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
ViewFusion processes a variable number of input views through parallel U-Net streams, with each stream producing both a noise prediction and a per-pixel weight mask. These weights are normalized via softmax and applied to the noise predictions, which are then summed to form the final noise prediction used in the diffusion denoising process. The model operates without explicit pose information, instead using the target view angle as conditioning. Training uses L2 loss on noise predictions with a linear noise schedule over 2000 timesteps, and the model can handle anywhere from 1 to 6 input views per training batch. The architecture is based on Saharia et al. (2022) with dual heads for noise and weights, and feature-wise affine transformations for conditioning on target angle and timestep.

## Key Results
- Achieves LPIPS scores of 0.033 (variable input) and 0.053 (single view) on NMR dataset
- Outperforms or matches comparable methods while offering significant flexibility improvements
- Successfully generates plausible views in severely underdetermined conditions (e.g., single view generating rear view)
- Demonstrates ability to adaptively weight input views based on their informativeness for different regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learned weighting mechanism adaptively focuses on the most informative input views for each region of the target view
- Mechanism: The model produces per-pixel weight masks that are normalized via softmax and applied to noise predictions from each view stream, then summed to form the final noise prediction
- Core assumption: Different input views contain varying amounts of information about different regions of the target view
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the most informative input views are taken into account"
  - [section 3.1]: "The weights tensor W∈R(3×N)×H×W is then normalized using softmax along the channel dimension. Next, these normalized weights are applied to the noise, and the weighted noise contributions are then summed"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific weighting mechanism
- Break condition: If the weighting mechanism fails to identify the most informative views, the model would produce lower quality novel views with incorrect details

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model can handle variable numbers of input views at both train and test time
- Mechanism: Each input view is processed through identical U-Net streams in parallel, and the weighted sum aggregation naturally scales to any number of views
- Core assumption: The model architecture can process an arbitrary number of view streams without architectural changes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time"
  - [section 3.1]: "Given a variable set of input views {xi∈R3×H×W}N i=1 we concatenate...to each of the views"
  - [section 4.3]: "Additionally, we use the same model (without retraining) to compute the metrics for the setting where it receives anywhere between one and six views"
- Break condition: If the model encounters a number of views significantly larger than seen during training, the aggregation might become unstable or lose effectiveness

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Generative nature allows plausible view generation even in severely underdetermined conditions
- Mechanism: The diffusion process provides stochasticity that enables sampling multiple plausible views when the input is insufficient to determine a unique output
- Core assumption: The diffusion denoising process inherently contains enough variability to generate diverse, plausible outputs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature)"
  - [section 3.2]: Probabilistic interpretation showing how the mixture of experts formulation enables permutation-invariant, generative behavior
  - [section 4.4]: Figure 5 shows the model generating multiple plausible rear views when only front views are provided
- Break condition: If the diffusion process becomes too deterministic or the noise schedule is insufficient, the model would fail to generate diverse plausible views

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models and score-based generative modeling
  - Why needed here: The entire approach is built on the diffusion framework, using iterative denoising to generate novel views
  - Quick check question: How does the score function ∇y log p(yt-1|ct) relate to the noise prediction in the model?

- Concept: Mixture of experts and permutation invariance
  - Why needed here: The model combines information from multiple views using a weighted sum, requiring the combination to be invariant to view order
  - Quick check question: Why is it important that the transition probability p(yt-1|ct) doesn't depend on the order of input views?

- Concept: Softmax weighting and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The per-pixel weighting masks are normalized using softmax to create a proper weighting scheme
  - Quick check question: What property does softmax normalization ensure when applied to the weight masks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input views → U-Net streams (parallel) → Noise predictions + weight masks → Softmax normalization → Weighted sum → Final noise prediction → Denoising step
- Critical path: The denoising loop where each timestep processes all views in parallel, aggregates weighted noise, and produces the next timestep output
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Flexibility (variable input views) vs. computational cost (linear scaling with view count)
  - Generative capability (plausible underdetermined views) vs. inference speed
  - No explicit 3D embedding (simplicity) vs. potential 3D consistency issues
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor quality views when using too few or uninformative views
  - Blurry or incorrect details when the weighting mechanism fails
  - Slow inference when processing many views or high resolution
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test single-view performance to verify the baseline denoising capability
  2. Test multi-view aggregation with known informative views to verify weighting works
  3. Test underdetermined conditions (e.g., single view generating rear view) to verify generative capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper explicitly states that training on larger datasets like Objaverse or CO3D would be interesting to improve performance while maintaining flexibility
- The paper mentions that latent diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) could be explored to address slow inference speed
- The paper suggests that incorporating explicit 3D scene embeddings could be investigated to improve 3D consistency

## Limitations
- Lack of explicit 3D scene embedding may lead to inconsistencies in generated views
- Linear computational scaling with view count could become prohibitive for many input views
- Notably slow inference due to iterative denoising process, challenging for real-time applications

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of learned weighting for noise gradient aggregation and the ability to handle variable input views are well-supported by the architecture description and experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about generative capability in underdetermined conditions are supported by qualitative examples but lack comprehensive quantitative analysis across different degrees of underdetermination
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance comparisons with other methods are reasonable but limited to a specific dataset and resolution (64×64), with no evaluation at higher resolutions or on more diverse datasets

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset Generalization**: Evaluate the pre-trained model on a different novel view synthesis dataset (e.g., RealEstate10K or LLFF) without fine-tuning to assess generalization capability across scene types and acquisition methods
2. **Ablation on Weighting Mechanism**: Conduct an ablation study comparing the learned weighting approach against fixed equal weighting and simple concatenation baselines to quantify the contribution of the adaptive weighting mechanism to overall performance
3. **Scaling Analysis**: Systematically evaluate performance and inference time as a function of input view count (1-10 views) to characterize the practical limits of the linear scaling and identify potential bottlenecks in the architecture
