# FinBen: A Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.12659
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12659
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: FinBen is the first comprehensive open-source benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in the financial domain, introducing 36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks across seven critical aspects.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FinBen, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in the financial domain. FinBen addresses the gap in extensive evaluation studies by providing 36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks across seven critical aspects: information extraction, textual analysis, question answering, text generation, risk management, forecasting, and decision-making. The benchmark includes novel tasks like stock trading, agent-based evaluation, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation, along with three new datasets for text summarization, QA, and stock trading. Evaluation of 15 representative LLMs reveals that while LLMs excel in information extraction and textual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting.

## Method Summary
FinBen is constructed by curating 36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks organized into seven critical aspects. The benchmark introduces three novel datasets (EDTSum for text summarization, FinTrade for stock trading, and Regulations for compliance QA) and incorporates existing datasets from established financial NLP benchmarks. Fifteen representative LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, and various open-source models are evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot approaches. The evaluation employs task-specific metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, Sharpe ratio, and Matthews correlation coefficient. The benchmark has been used to host a shared task at IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams whose solutions outperformed GPT-4.

## Key Results
- FinBen reveals LLMs excel in information extraction and textual analysis but struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting
- GPT-4 performs best in information extraction and stock trading tasks, while Gemini leads in text generation and forecasting
- The FinBen benchmark successfully hosted a shared task at IJCAI-2024 where 12 teams developed solutions that outperformed GPT-4

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FinBen enables accurate assessment of LLM capabilities across multiple financial domains.
- Mechanism: By providing 36 diverse datasets spanning 24 financial tasks organized into 7 critical aspects, FinBen offers a structured framework that captures the complexity and breadth of real-world financial applications.
- Core assumption: Financial tasks require different skill sets, and comprehensive evaluation across these domains reveals true LLM capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks, covering seven critical aspects: information extraction (IE), textual analysis (TA), question answering (QA), text generation (TG), risk management (RM), forecasting (FO), and decision-making (DM)."
  - [section 2.1] "We propose a novel taxonomy for financial evaluation tasks, categorizing and assessing LLMs across seven financial domains... Information Extraction focuses on identifying key entities and relationships... Textual Analysis delves into content and sentiment analysis... Question Answering evaluates the model's ability to comprehend and respond to financial queries..."
- Break condition: If the taxonomy doesn't accurately represent real financial workflows, or if tasks are too narrow to capture domain complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FinBen reveals LLM performance limitations in complex reasoning and numerical understanding.
- Mechanism: By including tasks that require causal reasoning, numerical labeling, and multi-step financial calculations, FinBen exposes areas where LLMs struggle despite excelling in simpler information extraction and textual analysis tasks.
- Core assumption: Complex financial tasks require advanced reasoning capabilities that current LLMs haven't fully developed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While LLMs excel in IE and textual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting."
  - [section 4.1] "for more complex information extraction tasks, such as causal detection (CD) and numerical understanding (FNXL and FSRL), even GPT-4's performance is limited, with Gemini showing only slightly better results"
- Break condition: If task design doesn't accurately test reasoning capabilities, or if evaluation metrics don't capture nuanced performance differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FinBen drives innovation by providing a standardized benchmark for financial LLM development.
- Mechanism: By hosting shared tasks and releasing comprehensive datasets, FinBen creates a competitive environment that encourages researchers to develop novel solutions that outperform existing models.
- Core assumption: Standardized benchmarks with clear evaluation metrics enable fair comparison and motivate innovation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FinBen has been used to host the first financial LLMs shared task at the FinNLP-AgentScen workshop during IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams. Their novel solutions outperformed GPT-4"
  - [section 2.3] "FinBen offers several innovations: a broader range of tasks and datasets, the first evaluation of stock trading, novel agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation"
- Break condition: If shared tasks don't attract meaningful participation, or if solutions don't generalize beyond benchmark datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Financial domain taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Understanding the seven financial aspects (IE, TA, QA, TG, RM, FO, DM) is crucial for interpreting FinBen results and designing new financial LLM applications
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between textual analysis and information extraction in financial contexts?

- Concept: Financial evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Knowing metrics like F1 score, Exact Match Accuracy, Sharpe Ratio, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient is essential for correctly interpreting benchmark results
  - Quick check question: When would you use Matthews Correlation Coefficient instead of F1 score in financial classification tasks?

- Concept: Zero-shot vs few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding these evaluation approaches is critical for interpreting LLM performance on FinBen tasks
  - Quick check question: How would you design prompts for zero-shot evaluation of a new financial task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset curation pipeline -> Task categorization system -> Evaluation framework -> Shared task platform
- Critical path: Dataset collection -> taxonomy mapping -> prompt engineering -> evaluation execution -> result analysis -> shared task deployment
- Design tradeoffs: Broader task coverage vs. evaluation consistency, open-source accessibility vs. commercial model inclusion, task difficulty vs. benchmark completion feasibility
- Failure signatures: Poor task coverage indicating taxonomy gaps, inconsistent evaluation metrics across tasks, model performance saturation suggesting task simplicity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a simple model on information extraction tasks to verify baseline functionality
  2. Test a complex reasoning task to identify LLM limitations
  3. Run a cross-task analysis to validate taxonomy organization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do LLMs perform on financial tasks in languages other than English, particularly for non-English speaking markets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that tasks are based on American market data and English texts, which may limit the benchmark's applicability to global financial markets.
- Why unresolved: The FinBen benchmark primarily uses English datasets, and there is no evaluation of LLMs' performance on non-English financial tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluations of LLMs on financial tasks in various languages, including datasets from non-English speaking markets, would provide insights into their generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific limitations of smaller LLMs (less than 70 billion parameters) in handling complex financial reasoning and decision-making tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that smaller models have difficulty adhering to trading instructions consistently due to limited comprehension and constrained context windows.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focused on larger models, leaving the performance of smaller models on complex tasks unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating smaller LLMs on the same tasks as larger models, particularly in stock trading and forecasting, would highlight their specific limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LLMs be improved to better handle imbalanced data in risk management tasks such as credit scoring and fraud detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that LLMs with low instruction-following abilities tend to classify all cases into a single class in imbalanced datasets, resulting in poor performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide solutions or methods to address the challenges LLMs face with imbalanced data in risk management.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of techniques to improve LLMs' handling of imbalanced data, such as advanced sampling methods or specialized training strategies, would address this issue.

## Limitations

- The evaluation of LLM performance across diverse financial tasks faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of datasets and evaluation metrics, making cross-task performance comparison difficult
- The selection of 15 representative LLMs may not capture the full landscape of available models, and the computational requirements for comprehensive evaluation are substantial
- Claims about FinBen's impact on driving innovation in financial LLMs are based on initial results but long-term impact remains to be seen

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core claims about FinBen's comprehensive coverage of 24 financial tasks across 7 domains and its status as the first open-source benchmark for financial LLMs. The dataset curation process and task taxonomy are well-documented and verifiable.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about relative model performance, particularly the assertion that GPT-4 excels in information extraction while Gemini leads in text generation and forecasting. These findings are based on the specific evaluation setup and may vary with different prompting strategies or evaluation conditions.

**Low Confidence**: Predictions about FinBen's impact on driving innovation in financial LLMs. While the IJCAI-2024 shared task results are promising, long-term impact on the field remains to be seen.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-metric aggregation validation**: Implement a standardized method for comparing model performance across different tasks with varying evaluation metrics, such as using normalized scores or rank-based aggregation.

2. **Model selection expansion**: Evaluate additional representative LLMs beyond the initial 15, particularly newer models released after the paper's publication, to verify whether the observed performance patterns hold.

3. **Resource-efficient evaluation**: Develop and validate a reduced computational approach that maintains evaluation fidelity while requiring fewer computational resources, enabling broader adoption of the benchmark.
