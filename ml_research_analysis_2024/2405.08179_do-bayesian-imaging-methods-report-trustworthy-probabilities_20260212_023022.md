# Do Bayesian imaging methods report trustworthy probabilities?
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.08179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08179
- Reference count: 40
- Bayesian imaging methods often fail to provide reliable uncertainty quantification despite improved estimation accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether Bayesian imaging methods produce trustworthy probabilities that reflect true uncertainty in image reconstruction. The authors develop a Monte Carlo methodology to benchmark credible regions from Bayesian models against those derived from true posterior distributions, using a test dataset to approximate nature's prior. The approach quantifies discrepancies between desired and empirically observed coverage probabilities through an error measure. Testing five canonical Bayesian imaging techniques reveals that newer methods achieving higher image estimation accuracy often fail to deliver reliable uncertainty quantification, with some producing overconfident credible regions that rarely contain the true solution while others are overly conservative.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a Monte Carlo methodology to assess whether Bayesian imaging methods produce meaningful probabilities under experiment replication rather than just subjective beliefs. The approach benchmarks credible regions from Bayesian models against those derived from true posterior distributions, using a test dataset to approximate nature's prior. An error measure quantifies the discrepancy between desired and empirically observed coverage probabilities. The methodology is applied to five canonical Bayesian imaging techniques ranging from classical Markov random fields to modern data-driven approaches like DDRM. The framework evaluates both the accuracy of image estimation and the reliability of uncertainty quantification across different methods.

## Key Results
- Newer Bayesian imaging methods achieve higher image estimation accuracy but often fail to provide reliable uncertainty quantification
- Some methods produce highly overconfident credible regions that rarely contain the true solution
- Progress in image estimation accuracy does not necessarily translate to improved UQ performance
- Existing Bayesian methods generally struggle to deliver trustworthy probabilities for uncertainty quantification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by comparing the empirical coverage of Bayesian credible regions against their nominal coverage rates across multiple realizations. By approximating nature's prior using a test dataset and measuring the frequency with which true solutions fall within reported credible regions, the approach reveals whether reported probabilities reflect actual uncertainty. The error measure quantifies systematic deviations between desired and observed coverage, distinguishing overconfident methods that underestimate uncertainty from conservative methods that overestimate it. This Monte Carlo validation provides an empirical test of whether Bayesian imaging methods' uncertainty quantification can be trusted for decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- **Nature's prior approximation**: Using test datasets to represent the underlying data distribution; needed to evaluate method performance without knowing the true prior; quick check: verify test set is representative of application domain
- **Credible region coverage**: The probability that true solutions fall within reported confidence bounds; essential for assessing UQ reliability; quick check: compare nominal vs empirical coverage rates
- **Error measure for UQ**: Quantifying discrepancies between desired and observed coverage probabilities; critical for benchmarking methods; quick check: ensure error measure captures both overconfidence and underconfidence

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data generation -> Bayesian method application -> Credible region computation -> Empirical coverage assessment -> Error quantification
- **Critical path**: The Monte Carlo simulation loop where multiple datasets are generated, Bayesian methods applied, and coverage statistics computed to produce the final error measure
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing computational cost of Monte Carlo validation against accuracy of error estimates; using test datasets to approximate nature's prior introduces approximation error
- **Failure signatures**: Overconfident methods show low empirical coverage despite high nominal coverage; conservative methods show high empirical coverage but wide credible regions; poor UQ may occur despite good image estimation
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Test framework on synthetic data with known ground truth to validate methodology; 2) Apply to a simple Bayesian method with analytical posterior for baseline comparison; 3) Compare results across different test dataset sizes to assess approximation stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain regarding the generalizability of the findings across different imaging modalities and acquisition settings. The study focuses on specific canonical methods and test scenarios, raising questions about whether the observed discrepancies in uncertainty quantification would persist in other contexts. The approximation of nature's prior using a test dataset introduces potential biases that could affect the error measure's accuracy.

## Limitations
- Results based on specific canonical methods may not generalize to all Bayesian imaging approaches
- Test dataset approximation of nature's prior may introduce biases affecting error measure accuracy
- Focus on particular imaging scenarios limits conclusions about cross-domain applicability

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the methodological framework for evaluating Bayesian imaging methods' uncertainty quantification
- **Medium confidence** in the comparative performance rankings across the five tested methods
- **Low confidence** in the absolute error values due to the approximation of nature's prior

## Next Checks
1. Apply the Monte Carlo validation methodology to additional imaging modalities (e.g., ultrasound, MRI) to assess cross-domain generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the test dataset size and composition to quantify the impact of nature's prior approximation
3. Implement and test the framework on emerging Bayesian methods beyond the five canonical approaches to determine if newer techniques consistently underperform in UQ despite superior estimation accuracy
