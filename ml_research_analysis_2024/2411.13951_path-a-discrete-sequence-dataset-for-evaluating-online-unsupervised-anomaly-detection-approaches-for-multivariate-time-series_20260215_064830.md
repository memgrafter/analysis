# PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.13951
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: New simulation-based dataset featuring 3,557 multivariate time series across 16 features for online unsupervised anomaly detection in discrete-sequence automotive powertrain scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the PATH dataset, a novel simulation-based dataset for evaluating online unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series. Generated from a realistic electric vehicle simulation model, PATH addresses the gap in discrete-sequence anomaly detection, where each time series represents an independent process chunk. The dataset features diverse and complex data reflecting real-world automotive powertrain behavior, with various anomaly types such as regenerative braking failure and increased wheel diameter. It is provided in different versions for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection, as well as time series generation and forecasting.

## Method Summary
The PATH dataset is generated using a state-of-the-art electric vehicle simulation model that reflects realistic automotive powertrain behavior. The dataset consists of 3,557 unique time series across 16 features, with anomalies introduced through parameter changes in the simulation. It is provided in multiple versions: unsupervised (contaminated training data), semi-supervised (clean training subset), and variants for time series generation and forecasting. Baseline experiments employ deep learning methods including deterministic and variational autoencoders, along with a non-parametric approach, using 256-step windows, z-score normalization, and early stopping.

## Key Results
- The PATH dataset successfully captures complex multivariate patterns and diverse anomaly types in discrete-sequence automotive scenarios
- Semi-supervised versions of the dataset significantly improve detection performance compared to unsupervised approaches
- Performance metrics show that model robustness to contaminated training data remains a key challenge in online anomaly detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The PATH dataset's simulation-based generation yields diverse, non-trivial anomalies that challenge real-world detection methods.
- Mechanism: By varying initial states (battery temperature, SoC) and introducing anomalies through parameter changes in a physically-inspired model, the dataset captures complex temporal and multivariate patterns that static datasets miss.
- Core assumption: The simulation model accurately reflects real-world powertrain dynamics, and anomalies introduced via parameter changes are meaningful and non-trivial.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The dataset is generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflect realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain.
  - [section 3.1] The FEV model is based on real-world physics and includes subsystems like drive cycle, driver, environment, controllers, and vehicle blocks.
  - [corpus] Related papers focus on benchmarking and taxonomy, indicating the importance of diverse, realistic datasets.
- Break condition: If the simulation model does not accurately represent real-world dynamics, the anomalies may be unrealistic and not generalizable to actual systems.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The discrete-sequence nature of the dataset captures independent process chunks, unlike continuous-sequence datasets.
- Mechanism: Each time series represents an independent process (e.g., automotive test bench), allowing detection of anomalies in isolated events rather than continuous monitoring.
- Core assumption: The independent nature of discrete sequences is a valid and important use case for anomaly detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions.
  - [section 1] Discrete-sequence anomaly detection is defined as detecting anomalies in N chunks of processes that happen independently of each other.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus, but related papers on benchmarking suggest the need for diverse datasets.
- Break condition: If real-world applications do not involve independent process chunks, the discrete-sequence nature may not be relevant.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The semi-supervised version of the dataset allows for improved detection performance by providing anomaly-free training data.
- Mechanism: By offering a clean training subset, the semi-supervised version reduces the impact of contaminated training data, leading to better model performance.
- Core assumption: Semi-supervised learning is a practical and effective approach for anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The dataset is provided in different versions for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection.
  - [section 3.3] For semi-supervised anomaly detection, a clean Dtrain with only nominal time series is provided.
  - [section 4.3] Results show that the semi-supervised version significantly improves detection performance.
- Break condition: If semi-supervised learning is not feasible due to lack of clean training data, the semi-supervised version may not be useful.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can anomaly detection methods be made more robust to contaminated training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that models trained on semi-supervised versions outperform unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the performance gap between semi-supervised and unsupervised methods, it does not explore or propose specific techniques to improve robustness in contaminated training scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and benchmarking novel methods that explicitly handle contaminated training data, showing improved performance on the PATH dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are effective methods for finding suitable anomaly detection thresholds without labeled data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that threshold choice significantly influences detection performance and more work is needed on methods to find suitable thresholds without labeled data.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses rudimentary unsupervised threshold estimation and theoretical best thresholds but does not explore advanced unsupervised threshold selection techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposing and validating novel threshold selection methods that work effectively in unsupervised settings, demonstrated through improved detection performance on the PATH dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can online evaluation metrics be improved to handle multiple anomalous sub-sequences per time series?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for more sophisticated evolution of online evaluation metrics that do not assume a single anomalous sub-sequence per test time series.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation metrics may not accurately capture performance when multiple anomalies occur, potentially leading to misleading assessments of detection methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating new evaluation metrics that account for multiple anomalies, and demonstrating their effectiveness in distinguishing between different anomaly detection approaches.

## Limitations

- The simulation-based generation approach, while realistic, may not fully capture all real-world powertrain dynamics and edge cases
- The discrete-sequence nature may not translate well to continuous monitoring scenarios common in industrial applications
- Performance results are based on synthetic anomalies that may not reflect all real-world failure modes

## Confidence

- Medium confidence in the generalization of results to real-world scenarios, given the synthetic nature of the dataset
