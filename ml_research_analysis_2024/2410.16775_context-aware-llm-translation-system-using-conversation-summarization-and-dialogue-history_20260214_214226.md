# Context-Aware LLM Translation System Using Conversation Summarization and Dialogue History

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.16775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16775
- Reference count: 2
- Key outcome: Context-aware LLM translation system for customer support dialogues achieving strong human evaluation scores (91.35-95.71) and automated metrics (COMET 93.5, BLEU 47.6)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a context-aware LLM translation system for English-Korean customer support dialogues that addresses the challenges of informal and unstructured conversational text. The system leverages the two most recent dialogues as raw data while summarizing earlier conversations to manage context length effectively. Using the Gemma-2-27B-it model fine-tuned with DeepSpeed and LoRA, the approach balances detailed immediate context with summarized background information. The system demonstrates significant improvements in translation accuracy and coherence by incorporating dialogue history and summaries, achieving strong performance in both human evaluation and automated metrics.

## Method Summary
The method employs a context-aware approach for translating customer support dialogues between English and Korean. It uses the two most recent dialogues as raw data while summarizing earlier conversations to manage context length effectively. The system fine-tunes the Gemma-2-27B-it model using DeepSpeed and LoRA optimization techniques to handle the informal and unstructured nature of conversational text. This approach balances the need for detailed immediate context with the practical limitations of context window length, ensuring that relevant background information is preserved through summarization while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Human evaluation scores: 91.35 (English-to-Korean), 95.71 (Korean-to-English), 90.04 (document level)
- Automated metrics: COMET 93.5, chrF 66.0, BLEU 47.6, Contextual-COMET-QE 0.161
- Strong performance in both translation accuracy and coherence for customer support dialogues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its strategic approach to context management in dialogue translation. By using the two most recent dialogues as raw data, it preserves the detailed context of immediate conversations while summarizing earlier exchanges to manage context length. This prevents information overload while ensuring that relevant background is maintained. The fine-tuning of Gemma-2-27B-it with DeepSpeed and LoRA allows the model to better handle the informal, unstructured nature of customer support conversations, improving translation quality for this specific domain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Context window management**: Understanding how to balance detailed immediate context with summarized background information - needed to prevent information overload while preserving relevant dialogue history
- **Dialogue summarization techniques**: Methods for condensing earlier conversations into concise summaries - required to maintain context without exceeding model limitations
- **Domain-specific fine-tuning**: Adapting LLM models to handle informal conversational text - essential for improving translation quality in customer support scenarios
- **Model optimization with DeepSpeed and LoRA**: Techniques for efficient fine-tuning of large language models - necessary for practical deployment and resource management
- **Evaluation metrics for translation quality**: Understanding COMET, chrF, BLEU, and human evaluation methods - important for assessing system performance comprehensively
- **Cross-lingual dialogue understanding**: Mechanisms for maintaining coherence across language pairs in conversational contexts - critical for effective translation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input dialogues -> Context selection (2 most recent) -> Summarization (earlier dialogues) -> Fine-tuned Gemma-2-27B-it model -> Translated output

**Critical path:** The critical path involves selecting the two most recent dialogues, summarizing earlier conversations, and feeding this combined context into the fine-tuned model for translation.

**Design tradeoffs:** The system trades potential loss of context from conversations beyond the two most recent for manageable context length and computational efficiency. This design choice prioritizes immediate context while maintaining background through summarization.

**Failure signatures:** The system may miss critical contextual information from conversations beyond the immediate two, potentially affecting translation accuracy in longer support histories. Performance may degrade if summarization fails to capture essential background information.

**First experiments:**
1. Test the impact of varying context window length (1-5 dialogues) on translation quality
2. Evaluate the summarization component's effectiveness in preserving essential context
3. Benchmark translation quality with and without the fine-tuning optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The specific context window of two most recent dialogues may miss critical contextual information from earlier conversations in longer support histories
- The fine-tuning approach with Gemma-2-27B-it may not generalize well to other LLM architectures or smaller models
- The system's performance in other language pairs, domains, or more formal communication settings remains untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The translation quality metrics and human evaluation scores for the tested English-Korean customer support scenario
- **Medium confidence**: The general approach of using dialogue history and summarization for context management
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to other languages, domains, and real-time deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test the context window optimization by varying the number of recent dialogues used (1-5) and measuring impact on translation quality across different support session lengths
2. Evaluate the system's performance on other language pairs and communication domains to assess cross-domain generalization
3. Conduct real-time processing benchmarks to determine latency and computational requirements for live customer support deployment
