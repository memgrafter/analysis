# Code-Mixer Ya Nahi: Novel Approaches to Measuring Multilingual LLMs' Code-Mixing Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.11079
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11079
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Novel evaluation of multilingual LLMs' code-mixing capabilities using k-shot and rule-based prompting methods across five language pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces novel approaches to assess multilingual large language models' ability to handle code-mixed language, where speakers mix two or more languages in a single utterance. The authors propose two main methods: k-shot prompting, where models are given examples of code-mixed sentences, and rule-based prompting, which generates code-mixed sentences by applying linguistic rules. They evaluate three popular LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro) on English-to-code-mixed and code-mixed-to-English translation tasks across five language pairs: English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Gujarati, English-French, and English-Spanish. Results show that while k-shot prompting generally leads to better translation quality, rule-based prompting is promising for generating unique code-mixed sentences with different mixing styles.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates multilingual LLMs using two novel prompting approaches: k-shot prompting (with variants k-shotα and k-shotβ) and rule-based prompting. K-shot prompting provides the model with examples of code-mixed sentences to guide translation, while rule-based prompting applies linguistic transformations to generate code-mixed text. The evaluation uses a gold-standard dataset of 600 code-mixed sentences across five language pairs, measuring translation quality with BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR scores. Three LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Gemini Pro) are tested for both English-to-code-mixed and code-mixed-to-English translation tasks, with additional comparison to fine-tuned Flan-T5-Base.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieves the highest BLEU scores for English-to-code-mixed translation across most language pairs
- Gemini Pro performs best for code-mixed-to-English translation tasks, particularly for English-Hindi and English-French
- k-shotβ prompting (with English-code-mixed pairs) outperforms k-shotα (code-mixed only) for most translation tasks
- Rule-based prompting generates code-mixed sentences with varying linguistic styles, though with generally lower BLEU scores than k-shot methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Rule-based prompting generates code-mixed sentences with varying linguistic styles by manipulating source sentences through predefined transformation rules.
- **Mechanism:** The approach uses NLP tasks like POS tagging, noun phrase extraction, and translation to replace specific linguistic elements (words/phrases) in a source language sentence with their counterparts from a target language, followed by transliteration to Roman script.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can accurately perform NLP tasks (POS tagging, phrase extraction) and follow sequential instruction sets to produce grammatically correct code-mixed sentences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Rule-Based Prompting marks a novel way to utilize LLMs for generating code-mixed sentences... without any in-context learning."
  - [section 4]: Describes four specific rules using NLP tasks like POS tagging and phrase extraction to generate code-mixed sentences with different styles (insertional and alternating).
  - [corpus]: BLEU scores for rule-based generation (Table 9) show reasonable performance (e.g., Rule 1 achieves BLEU scores ranging from 12.75-24.43 across language pairs), indicating the approach generates coherent code-mixed sentences.
- **Break condition:** Rule-based prompting fails when the LLM cannot accurately perform required NLP tasks (e.g., incorrect POS tagging of non-English tokens) or when the rules lead to semantically redundant or grammatically incorrect sentences.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** k-shotβ prompting outperforms k-shotα prompting for English-to-code-mixed translation tasks by providing more informative examples.
- **Mechanism:** k-shotβ prompts include pairs of English sentences and their corresponding code-mixed translations, while k-shotα prompts only include code-mixed sentences. This additional context helps models better understand the linguistic mapping between languages.
- **Core assumption:** Providing explicit English-to-code-mixed translation examples helps models understand the specific transformation required, rather than inferring it from code-mixed examples alone.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Our findings suggest that though k-shot prompting often leads to the best results, Rule-Based prompting shows promise in generating unique code-mixed sentences that vary in their style of code-mixing."
  - [section 3.3.1]: "We observe that k-shotβ prompts frequently lead to better output than k-shotα prompts for all language pairs except English-Bengali."
  - [corpus]: Table 3 shows k-shotβ consistently achieves higher BLEU scores than k-shotα across most language pairs and models.
- **Break condition:** The advantage disappears when models can infer the translation pattern from code-mixed examples alone, or when the additional English sentences in k-shotβ introduce confusion rather than clarity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Gemini Pro performs best for code-mixed-to-English translation tasks across multiple language pairs, particularly for low-resource languages like Gujarati.
- **Mechanism:** The model's architecture and training data composition make it particularly adept at understanding and translating code-mixed text back to English, even for languages with limited resources.
- **Core assumption:** The model's training included sufficient code-mixed data and multilingual representations to handle the reverse translation task effectively.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Key findings include GPT-4's superior performance on most language pairs and Gemini Pro's effectiveness for English-Spanish and code-mixed-to-English tasks."
  - [section 3.3.2]: "Gemini Pro performs the best for English-Hindi and English-French across all k-shot (k=0, 1, 10, 20), followed by GPT-3.5-turbo, and then Gemini without any exceptions."
  - [corpus]: Table 6 shows Gemini Pro achieving the highest BLEU scores for English-Hindi (60.35) and English-French (55.05) in code-mixed-to-English tasks.
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades when the model encounters extremely low-resource languages with minimal training data, or when code-mixed text contains unusual mixing patterns not represented in the training data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Code-mixing (code-switching)
  - Why needed here: Understanding this phenomenon is fundamental to designing evaluation methods and interpreting results for multilingual LLM capabilities.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes code-mixing from code-switching, and why is this distinction important for evaluating LLM performance?

- **Concept:** Few-shot learning and prompting strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper relies heavily on k-shot prompting to evaluate model performance, making understanding different prompting approaches critical.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between k-shotα and k-shotβ prompting, and how does this affect model performance?

- **Concept:** Evaluation metrics for machine translation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR scores to evaluate translation quality, requiring understanding of their strengths and limitations.
  - Quick check question: Why might standard MT evaluation metrics like BLEU be insufficient for accurately evaluating code-mixed translations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Dataset creation (gold-standard code-mixed sentences) -> Model evaluation (k-shot and rule-based prompting) -> Real-world application (code-mixed chatbot using RAG)
- **Critical path:** For evaluating model performance, the critical path is: select English sentences → generate code-mixed translations using different prompting methods → evaluate against gold-standard translations using BLEU/ROUGE/METEOR metrics
- **Design tradeoffs:** The choice between k-shot and rule-based prompting involves balancing quality (k-shot generally performs better) against flexibility and style variation (rule-based can generate different mixing patterns). The trade-off between using high-resource vs. low-resource languages affects model performance and generalizability
- **Failure signatures:** Poor performance on English-Gujarati suggests low-resource language limitations; empty or repetitive outputs from Gemini Pro indicate model-specific issues; incorrect script usage (Devanagari/Bengali/Gujarati in Roman script tasks) reveals limitations in script control
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run k-shotβ prompting with 1 example for English-Hindi translation to establish baseline performance and compare with k-shotα
  2. Implement Rule 1 for generating code-mixed sentences from English to test the rule-based approach's viability
  3. Evaluate Gemini Pro on code-mixed-to-English translation for English-Hindi to verify the claim about its superior performance in this direction
