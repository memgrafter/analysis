# YouTube-SL-25: A Large-Scale, Open-Domain Multilingual Sign Language Parallel Corpus

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11144
- Authors: Garrett Tanzer; Biao Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 3000+ hours of video content across 25+ sign languages with multilingual transfer benefits

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces YouTube-SL-25, a large-scale multilingual sign language dataset with over 3000 hours of video content spanning 25+ sign languages. The dataset is constructed using a triage-based annotation approach that efficiently scales to multiple sign languages. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multilingual transfer benefits both higher- and lower-resource sign languages within YouTube-SL-25, with BLEURT scores reaching up to 40.1 for translation tasks and 99.9% top-1 accuracy for sign language identification on certain benchmarks.

## Method Summary
YouTube-SL-25 is constructed using a triage-based annotation approach that scales efficiently to multiple sign languages. The dataset leverages YouTube videos as source material, applying automated filtering and quality assessment to identify suitable content. The annotation process involves three tiers of verification to ensure translation quality while maintaining scalability. The corpus includes sign-to-text translation pairs and supports sign language identification tasks, making it suitable for both research and practical applications in sign language processing.

## Key Results
- BLEURT scores of up to 40.1 for sign-to-text translation tasks
- Top-1 accuracy of 99.9% for sign language identification on certain benchmarks
- Multilingual transfer improves performance for both higher- and lower-resource sign languages
- Dataset contains over 3000 hours of video content across 25+ sign languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The triage-based annotation approach enables efficient scaling to multiple sign languages while maintaining quality standards. By leveraging YouTube's vast video library and applying automated filtering, the method can identify suitable sign language content at scale. The multilingual pretraining strategy allows models to learn shared representations across sign languages, benefiting both resource-rich and resource-poor languages through transfer learning.

## Foundational Learning

### Sign Language Processing
- Why needed: Sign languages are visual-spatial languages with unique grammatical structures different from spoken languages
- Quick check: Verify that the dataset includes both lexical and non-manual features of sign languages

### Multilingual Transfer Learning
- Why needed: Enables models to leverage knowledge from high-resource sign languages to improve performance on low-resource ones
- Quick check: Compare performance of multilingual models versus monolingual baselines on low-resource sign languages

### Video-Based Annotation Systems
- Why needed: Efficient annotation is critical for scaling sign language datasets to multiple languages
- Quick check: Assess annotation quality consistency across different sign languages in the dataset

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
YouTube videos -> Automated filtering -> Triage annotation -> Parallel corpus -> Multimodal models

### Critical Path
The most critical component is the triage annotation system, which balances quality assurance with scalability. Without this system, scaling to 25+ sign languages would be prohibitively expensive or result in inconsistent quality across languages.

### Design Tradeoffs
The authors chose to include videos with multiple signers and less proficient signers to maximize data utility, trading off some data purity for broader coverage. They also opted for a triage-based annotation approach rather than full manual annotation to enable scaling across many sign languages.

### Failure Signatures
- Demographic biases (e.g., underrepresentation of dark skin tones)
- Quality inconsistencies across different sign languages
- Potential overfitting to YouTube-specific signing styles

### First 3 Experiments
1. Train baseline sign-to-text translation models with and without multilingual pretraining
2. Evaluate sign language identification accuracy across all 25+ languages
3. Test model robustness to videos with multiple signers versus single signers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the results change when using mT5 Small instead of T5-v1.1 Small as the base model?
The authors tried mT5 but found it underperformed with about 1/3 more steps to converge and worse results. They only ran initial experiments and did not complete the full set with mT5.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of including videos with multiple signers in frame on model performance and evaluation?
The authors chose not to exclude multi-signer videos but note that pose-based baselines only support one person's input. They are not aware of prior works studying this scenario.

### Open Question 3
How would the results change if the dataset were filtered to remove videos with less proficient signers?
The authors accepted relatively competent learners but acknowledge this may require more care for generation tasks. They did not evaluate the impact of including less proficient signers.

### Open Question 4
How would the results change if the dataset were balanced across different skin tones and demographic groups?
The dataset shows dark skin underrepresentation (1.9% of data at Monk 6-10). The authors acknowledge ensuring demographic fairness remains an important future problem.

## Limitations
- Potential demographic biases due to YouTube-sourced data (dark skin tones underrepresented)
- Quality inconsistencies across the 25+ sign languages from semi-automated annotation
- Lack of human evaluation limits confidence in practical translation quality

## Confidence
- High confidence: Dataset scale and multilingual coverage claims
- Medium confidence: Baseline experiment results for sign-to-text translation
- Medium confidence: Sign language identification task results
- Low confidence: Claims about real-world applicability without human evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies on sign-to-text translation outputs to validate BLEURT scores across all 25+ sign languages
2. Perform demographic and regional bias analysis to quantify representation gaps across sign languages
3. Extend evaluation to out-of-domain test sets and low-resource sign languages to verify multilingual transfer robustness
