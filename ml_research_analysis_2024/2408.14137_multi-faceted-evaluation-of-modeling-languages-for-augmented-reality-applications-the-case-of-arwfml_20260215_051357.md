# Multi-Faceted Evaluation of Modeling Languages for Augmented Reality Applications -- The Case of ARWFML

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.14137
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14137
- Authors: Fabian Muff; Hans-Georg Fill
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: ARWFML modeling language shows high comprehensibility with over 80% correct responses for model understanding questions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of ARWFML, a domain-specific modeling language for augmented reality applications. The authors developed a new 3D modeling environment (M2AR) to address limitations of previous 2D tools, enabling the creation of valid ARWFML models in three-dimensional space. Through an empirical user study with 35 participants, the research demonstrates that ARWFML constructs are highly comprehensible, with no significant correlation between comprehension and prior experience with augmented reality or conceptual modeling, indicating the language's accessibility to users without specialized domain knowledge.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multi-faceted evaluation approach including technical implementation comparisons, workflow pattern analysis, and comprehensibility assessment. The authors conducted an empirical user study where participants were introduced to ARWFML concepts and 3D notation, then asked to complete a comprehension survey. The evaluation measured percentage of correct responses for model understanding questions (>80% correct, >90% for 4 out of 5 general language comprehension questions) and analyzed correlation between comprehension and prior experience. The study separates language evaluation from tool implementation by using screenshots rather than hands-on interaction with M2AR.

## Key Results
- ARWFML models achieved over 80% correct responses for model understanding questions and more than 90% for four out of five general language comprehension questions
- No significant correlation found between comprehension scores and participants' prior experience with augmented reality or conceptual modeling
- ARWFML supports 8 out of 20 core workflow patterns, covering basic control flow and some advanced branching patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ARWFML's 3D notation improves comprehension by aligning modeling constructs with the spatial nature of AR applications
- Mechanism: Traditional 2D modeling environments struggle to represent three-dimensional AR scenarios effectively, leading to cognitive disconnect. The 3D notation directly maps modeling concepts (Detectable, Augmentation, Reference) to their spatial representations, reducing mental translation effort.
- Core assumption: Users can better understand AR workflows when the modeling environment mirrors the actual 3D space where the AR application will run
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Building upon the first design cycle of the language's specification, this paper presents two further design iterations for refining the language based on multi-faceted evaluations. These include... the introduction of a 3D notation"
  - [section 3.1] "the 2D notation of ARWFML (see Fig. 2) has been adapted to a 3D notation (see Fig. 4). It is important to note that ARWFML contains three-dimensional dynamic visualizations for the classes Detectable, Augmentation, and Reference"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only the paper itself mentions this specific 3D notation adaptation, no external validation found
- Break condition: If users find 3D environments more complex than 2D representations, or if the 3D notation adds unnecessary complexity without improving understanding

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Empirical evaluation with real users validates ARWFML's comprehensibility independent of tool implementation
- Mechanism: By separating the modeling language from the tool implementation, the study isolates whether the language concepts themselves are understandable. Users interact with 3D models created in M2AR, then answer comprehension questions without being influenced by tool-specific features.
- Core assumption: A modeling language's effectiveness can be evaluated independently of its implementation environment
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Measuring the comprehensibility of a modeling method is difficult, given that modeling is typically performed using a modeling tool, making it challenging to separate the method from the tool for evaluation"
  - [section 3.3] "the evaluation of the methodology through the use of screenshots rather than hands-on interaction with M2AR may result in a limitation of the level of comprehension that could be obtained through active engagement"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no external studies found that use this specific approach of separating language from tool for AR modeling language evaluation
- Break condition: If tool implementation details significantly influence language comprehension, or if users cannot understand models without interactive tool experience

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ARWFML supports basic to intermediate workflow patterns sufficient for practical AR applications
- Mechanism: By implementing 8 out of 20 core workflow patterns, ARWFML provides enough expressiveness for common AR scenarios while maintaining simplicity. The supported patterns cover essential control flow (sequence, parallel split, simple merge) and some advanced branching (multi-choice, multi-merge).
- Core assumption: Supporting a subset of workflow patterns is sufficient for most practical AR applications, and complexity can be added incrementally
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "ARWFML supports eight workflow patterns, including the most basic control flow patterns, which are essential for straightforward sequential and parallel processes"
  - [section 2.2] "Table 2 shows a summary of the modeling languages BPMN-CARX, ARLEM, and ARWFML regarding 20 selected workflow patterns"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only internal comparison data available, no external validation of pattern sufficiency for AR applications
- Break condition: If real-world AR applications require more complex workflow patterns than currently supported, or if the supported patterns prove insufficient for practical use cases

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Domain-specific modeling languages for AR
  - Why needed here: Understanding that ARWFML is a specialized language for creating AR workflows without programming knowledge is crucial for evaluating its effectiveness
  - Quick check question: What are the three main model types in ARWFML and what does each represent?

- Concept: Workflow patterns in process modeling
  - Why needed here: The evaluation compares ARWFML against 20 core workflow patterns to assess its expressiveness and practical applicability
  - Quick check question: How many of the 20 core workflow patterns does ARWFML currently support, and what are the implications?

- Concept: 3D modeling environments vs 2D environments
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes the importance of 3D environments for AR modeling and introduces M2AR as a 3D-enabled tool
  - Quick check question: Why is a 3D modeling environment necessary for ARWFML, and what limitations did 2D tools present?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ARWFML language specification (metamodel) -> M2AR 3D modeling environment (new version) -> AR Engine for model execution -> Empirical evaluation framework

- Critical path: Language specification → 3D notation design → M2AR implementation → User study execution → Comprehensibility validation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs expressiveness: Supporting fewer workflow patterns makes the language easier to learn but limits application complexity
  - 3D visualization vs performance: Rich 3D representations improve understanding but may require more computational resources
  - Tool independence vs integration: Separating language from tool enables pure language evaluation but may miss tool-language interaction effects

- Failure signatures:
  - Low comprehension scores in user study indicate language complexity issues
  - Difficulty creating valid 3D models suggests M2AR usability problems
  - Unsupported workflow patterns reveal expressiveness limitations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Create simple ARWFML models using M2AR for common AR scenarios (e.g., marker-based information display)
  2. Compare comprehension scores between 2D and 3D model representations of the same AR scenarios
  3. Test whether users with different levels of AR and modeling experience show different comprehension patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ARWFML compare to BPMN-CARX in terms of supporting complex workflow patterns involving multiple instances and state-based decisions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that ARWFML supports 8 out of 20 workflow patterns, while BPMN-CARX supports 15. It also mentions that ARWFML does not support patterns involving multiple instances and state-based decisions, which are supported by BPMN-CARX.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the specific patterns that ARWFML cannot support but BPMN-CARX can. It also does not discuss the implications of these limitations on the practical use of ARWFML in complex scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the specific workflow patterns that ARWFML cannot support, along with case studies or examples demonstrating the limitations in real-world applications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using a 3D modeling environment like M2AR compared to a 2D environment for creating ARWFML models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces M2AR as a new 3D modeling environment for ARWFML and mentions that it allows for spatial alignment of three-dimensional objects, which is advantageous for modeling Statechanges. However, it also notes that M2AR is a prototypical tool and not yet mature enough for a usability study.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of the benefits and drawbacks of using M2AR versus a 2D environment for creating ARWFML models. It also does not discuss the potential impact of the 3D environment on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of creating ARWFML models in M2AR versus a 2D environment, along with user feedback on the comprehensibility and usability of the models created in each environment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the comprehensibility of ARWFML models vary across different user groups with varying levels of familiarity with augmented reality and conceptual modeling?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents the results of an empirical user study on the comprehensibility of ARWFML models, which included participants with varying levels of familiarity with conceptual modeling and augmented reality. The study found no significant correlation between comprehension and prior experience in these areas.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the comprehensibility of ARWFML models varies across different user groups with varying levels of familiarity with augmented reality and conceptual modeling. It also does not discuss the potential reasons for the lack of correlation observed in the study.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more detailed analysis of the comprehensibility results across different user groups, along with interviews or surveys to understand the potential reasons for the lack of correlation between comprehension and prior experience.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily demonstrates ARWFML's comprehensibility for basic to intermediate workflow patterns but lacks validation of its applicability to complex, real-world AR scenarios
- Study sample size (n=35) provides initial validation but may not capture full diversity in AR experience levels and technical backgrounds
- Separation of language evaluation from tool implementation may not fully represent practical usage scenarios where tool limitations affect language effectiveness

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: ARWFML's basic comprehensibility for fundamental AR concepts (supported by >80% correct responses and strong performance on general comprehension questions)

**Medium Confidence**: ARWFML's sufficiency for basic to intermediate workflow patterns (based on internal comparison but lacking external validation)

**Medium Confidence**: 3D notation's superiority over 2D representations (supported by theoretical arguments but requiring direct comparative studies)

## Next Checks
1. **External Validation Study**: Conduct a comparative evaluation with AR developers using ARWFML against alternative modeling approaches to validate practical effectiveness beyond comprehensibility metrics.

2. **Complex Scenario Testing**: Evaluate ARWFML's expressiveness and comprehensibility when modeling sophisticated AR applications requiring advanced workflow patterns not currently supported.

3. **Long-term Usability Assessment**: Implement a longitudinal study tracking users' ability to create increasingly complex ARWFML models over time, measuring learning curves and productivity gains.
