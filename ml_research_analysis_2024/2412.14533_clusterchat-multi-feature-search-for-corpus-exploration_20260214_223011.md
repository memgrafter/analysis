# ClusterChat: Multi-Feature Search for Corpus Exploration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.14533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14533
- Authors: Ashish Chouhan; Saifeldin Mandour; Michael Gertz
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Multi-feature search system combining clustering, faceted search, and QA for corpus exploration

## Executive Summary
ClusterChat introduces a comprehensive system for exploring large biomedical corpora through multi-dimensional search capabilities. The system processes approximately 4 million PubMed abstracts from 2020-2024, organizing them into clusters using document embeddings while enabling interactive refinement through faceted search and question answering. By integrating document clustering with semantic search and a RAG pipeline, ClusterChat provides users with both overview-level insights and granular document-level information retrieval, achieving average query latency of 2 seconds across 46 million indexed sentence embeddings.

## Method Summary
The system employs PubMedBERT to generate 768-dimensional embeddings for each abstract, applies UMAP dimensionality reduction, and uses HDBSCAN for clustering. Each abstract is segmented into sentences, embedded separately, and indexed in OpenSearch for efficient retrieval. Users interact through a frontend visualization that displays clusters, allows filtering by date ranges and keywords, and supports both corpus-level and document-level question answering via a RAG pipeline using Mixtral-8x7B. The architecture combines established NLP techniques with interactive visualization to create an integrated corpus exploration environment.

## Key Results
- Combines document clustering, faceted search, and question answering for enhanced corpus exploration
- Achieves 2-second average query latency on 46 million indexed sentence embeddings
- Enables interactive refinement of searches through date range filtering, keyword selection, and thematic clustering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-dimensional search capabilities enhance corpus exploration by combining clustering, faceted search, and question answering.
- Mechanism: Users can first get a thematic overview through clustering, then refine searches through facets before asking specific questions about selected documents or clusters.
- Core assumption: Multiple complementary exploration modes benefit users more than single search approaches.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section descriptions of integrated clustering and faceted search; no direct corpus evidence for effectiveness.
- Break condition: If clustering quality degrades or facets become too sparse, the multi-dimensional approach may confuse rather than help users.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RAG pipeline enables efficient document-level QA by retrieving relevant sentences from 46 million indexed chunks.
- Mechanism: Sentences are embedded and indexed in OpenSearch; top-10 relevant sentences are retrieved based on similarity and fed to Mixtral-8x7B for answer generation.
- Core assumption: Sentence-level retrieval provides sufficient context without overwhelming the language model.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions 46 million indexed chunks and Mixtral-8x7B usage; section details sentence segmentation and embedding.
- Break condition: If top-10 sentences lack sufficient context or contain contradictory information, answer quality may degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: UMAP dimensionality reduction preserves local and global structures essential for meaningful clustering.
- Mechanism: Abstracts are converted to 768-dim vectors using PubMedBERT, then reduced with UMAP before HDBSCAN clustering to preserve semantic relationships.
- Core assumption: UMAP effectively maintains semantic relationships in reduced dimensional space for clustering purposes.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section describe UMAP usage for preserving structures needed for meaningful clustering.
- Break condition: If UMAP fails to preserve semantic relationships, clusters may become meaningless or overly fragmented.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text embedding models (PubMedBERT)
  - Why needed here: PubMedBERT generates 768-dimensional embeddings that form the foundation for clustering and semantic search.
  - Quick check question: What is the dimensionality of the embeddings generated by PubMedBERT in this system?

- Concept: Clustering algorithms (HDBSCAN)
  - Why needed here: HDBSCAN identifies clusters of varying densities in the reduced embedding space, forming the basis for thematic organization.
  - Quick check question: What type of clustering algorithm is used, and why is it particularly suitable for this application?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: The system implements a RAG pipeline to answer both corpus-level and document-level questions by retrieving relevant sentences and generating answers using a large language model.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main components of the RAG pipeline used in this system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Ingestion -> PubMedBERT embedding -> UMAP reduction -> HDBSCAN clustering -> OpenSearch indexing -> Frontend visualization -> User interaction -> RAG retrieval -> Mixtral answer generation

- Critical path: Abstract ingestion → PubMedBERT embedding → UMAP reduction → HDBSCAN clustering → OpenSearch indexing → Frontend visualization → User interaction (faceted search/Q&A) → RAG retrieval → Mixtral answer generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sentence-level vs. abstract-level chunking for RAG: Sentence-level provides granularity but may lose context; abstract-level preserves context but may retrieve irrelevant information
  - PubMedBERT vs. general-purpose BERT: Domain-specific vs. broader applicability
  - Mixtral-8x7B vs. smaller models: Better quality vs. faster response times

- Failure signatures:
  - High query latency (>2 seconds): Check OpenSearch performance or embedding indexing
  - Poor clustering quality: Verify UMAP reduction parameters or HDBSCAN density thresholds
  - Inaccurate QA answers: Check sentence retrieval relevance or examine Mixtral prompt engineering
  - Frontend performance issues: Monitor Cosmograph visualization rendering or OpenSearch query times

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test end-to-end pipeline with 100 abstracts to verify embedding generation, clustering, and basic search functionality.
  2. Benchmark query latency with varying indexed chunks (10K, 100K, 1M) to understand OpenSearch scaling.
  3. Evaluate clustering quality by manually inspecting sample clusters for coherence and meaningful relationships.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ClusterChat compare to OpenResearcher and RichRAG on the same PubMed corpus?
- Basis in paper: Paper mentions these systems as related works but provides no comparative evaluation.
- Why unresolved: Authors only demonstrate functionality through case studies without benchmarking against similar systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation comparing ClusterChat against OpenResearcher and RichRAG on the same 4 million PubMed abstracts, measuring discovery accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different embedding models and clustering algorithms on cluster quality and search results?
- Basis in paper: Authors selected PubMedBERT after pilot experiments but didn't explore alternative approaches.
- Why unresolved: PubMedBERT and HDBSCAN were chosen without detailed analysis of alternatives' impact on results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing PubMedBERT with BioBERT/ClinicalBERT and HDBSCAN with K-means/DBSCAN using cluster coherence and search relevance metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How scalable is ClusterChat for larger corpora beyond 4 million documents, and what are computational bottlenecks?
- Basis in paper: Authors mention 2-second latency on 46M embeddings but don't explore scalability or identify bottlenecks.
- Why unresolved: Paper only demonstrates performance on 4M documents without analyzing larger dataset performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance testing on progressively larger corpora (10M, 50M, 100M documents) with memory usage, latency, and resource requirement analysis.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do users interact with multi-dimensional exploration features, and what are optimal filtering/search strategies?
- Basis in paper: Paper describes multi-dimensional capabilities but lacks user studies or interaction pattern analysis.
- Why unresolved: Authors demonstrate features but provide no empirical data on user utilization patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies tracking interaction patterns, time spent on features, and task completion rates to identify most effective feature combinations.

## Limitations
- No quantitative evaluation of clustering quality, search effectiveness, or QA accuracy metrics
- Performance scaling beyond 4 million documents and concurrent user loads remains untested
- Sentence-level chunking may create context fragmentation for complex biomedical concepts
- Limited adaptability to other domains without significant PubMedBERT retraining

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Technical implementation details are well-documented and follow established NLP practices with appropriate component integration.

**Medium Confidence**: Performance metrics appear feasible but lack independent verification; multi-feature approach effectiveness is asserted but not empirically validated.

**Low Confidence**: Actual impact on corpus exploration effectiveness remains uncertain due to absence of user testing, quantitative quality metrics, and comparative benchmarks.

## Next Checks
1. **Clustering Quality Validation**: Evaluate clustering using silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or manual inspection to verify meaningful topic grouping and effective UMAP dimensionality reduction.

2. **RAG Pipeline Effectiveness Testing**: Systematically test answer accuracy across query types, measure sentence retrieval relevance, and assess whether sentence-level chunking provides sufficient context for biomedical QA.

3. **Scalability and Performance Benchmarking**: Measure performance under increasing loads (10K, 100K, 1M, 10M embeddings) to validate 2-second latency, identify bottlenecks, and assess concurrent query handling capabilities.
