# Disentangling segmental and prosodic factors to non-native speech comprehensibility

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Accent conversion system disentangles voice quality, segmental features, and prosody from non-native speech

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an accent conversion system that independently disentangles voice quality, segmental features, and prosody from non-native speech. The key innovation is using vector quantization of phonetic posteriorgram embeddings combined with duplicate removal to effectively remove prosodic information from the segmental representation. The system enables controlled synthesis of speech by combining segmentals from one utterance, voice quality from another, and prosody from a third. Subjective and objective evaluations show the system successfully transfers prosody and speaker identity while maintaining speech quality. Perceptual listening tests reveal that segmental features have a larger impact on perceived comprehensibility of non-native speech than prosodic characteristics, contrary to prior research.

## Method Summary
The system uses a three-stage approach: first, an acoustic model (TDNN-F network) extracts bottleneck features (BNFs) from speech, capturing both segmental and prosodic information. Second, vector quantization (VQ) combined with duplicate removal (DR) is applied to the BNFs to remove prosodic timing information while preserving segmental content. Third, a sequence-to-sequence model combines the VQ'd BNF sequence, a speaker embedding (representing voice quality), and a prosody embedding (representing prosodic characteristics) to generate a Mel-spectrogram, which is then converted to speech using a HiFiGAN vocoder. The system is trained on ARCTIC and L2-ARCTIC corpora and evaluated through perceptual listening tests on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Key Results
- The accent conversion system successfully transfers prosody and speaker identity while maintaining speech quality (MCD: 5.88, MOS: 3.33)
- Vector quantization with duplicate removal improves speaker transfer performance compared to using raw BNFs
- Perceptual listening tests show that segmental features have a larger impact on non-native speech comprehensibility than prosodic characteristics, contrary to prior research
- The system can generate accent conversions that combine segmentals from one utterance, voice quality from another, and prosody from a third

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Vector quantization of phonetic posteriorgram embeddings combined with duplicate removal removes prosodic information from segmental representation
- Mechanism: The BNF matrix contains both segmental and prosodic information. VQ reduces the continuous acoustic space to discrete codewords, while duplicate removal eliminates consecutive repetitions, effectively removing timing/duration information. This forces the seq2seq model to rely on the prosody embedding from U3 rather than the prosody embedded in U1's BNF.
- Core assumption: Prosodic information in BNFs is primarily encoded through timing patterns and consecutive similar frames that can be removed without losing essential segmental content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "vector quantization of phonetic posteriorgram embeddings combined with duplicate removal to effectively remove prosodic information from the segmental representation"
  - [section III-E] "We propose a technique that reduces prosodic information in the PPG, bringing it close to the information available in a phonetic transcription. Namely, we apply vector quantization (VQ) to the PPGs, and then remove consecutive duplicates."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If prosodic information is encoded in non-temporal ways within BNFs (e.g., through spectral patterns), this mechanism would fail to remove it completely.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Disentangling voice quality, segmental features, and prosody enables independent control during synthesis
- Mechanism: The system architecture uses three separate information bottlenecks - speaker embedding (voice quality), VQ'd BNF sequence (segmentals), and prosody embedding. The seq2seq model learns to combine these independent channels to reconstruct the original Mel-spectrogram, enabling synthesis that can mix attributes from different utterances.
- Core assumption: The three information channels (speaker, segmentals, prosody) can be effectively separated and recombined without interference or information loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "system is able to generate accent conversions that combine (1) the segmental characteristics from a source utterance, (2) the voice characteristics from a target utterance, and (3) the prosody of a reference utterance"
  - [section III] "A seq2seq model consumes (1) the short sequence of BNF codewords from utterance U1, (2) a speaker embedding representing the voice quality in utterance U2 from a target speaker, and (3) a prosody embedding from a reference utterance U3"
  - [corpus] Moderate - related papers show similar disentanglement approaches work in practice
- Break condition: If the information channels are not truly independent, the seq2seq model may fail to properly combine attributes from different sources.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Vector quantization improves speaker transfer performance
- Mechanism: VQ compresses the BNF representation into discrete codewords, creating an information bottleneck that reduces residual speaker information in the segmental representation. This makes it easier for the seq2seq model to focus on prosody from the prosody embedding rather than speaker characteristics from the BNFs.
- Core assumption: The VQ process effectively removes speaker-specific information from the BNFs while preserving segmental content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-B] "As an objective measure, we visualized the embeddings produced by the speaker encoder... Results are shown as a tSNE plot in Figure 3. We find that speaker transfer is inversely related to the distance between each voice conversion... Voice conversions from vq128 are significantly closer to their target than those from vq∞"
  - [section IV-B] "voice conversions from vq128 are significantly closer to their target than those from vq∞, indicating that the VQ-DR step improves transfer from source to target speaker"
  - [corpus] Moderate - prior work (VQVC+) has shown VQ can improve VC performance
- Break condition: If VQ codewords retain speaker-specific patterns, or if the seq2seq model can still extract speaker information from the codeword sequence, this improvement may not materialize.

## Foundational Learning

### Phonetic Posteriorgram (PPG)
- Why needed here: The PPG serves as the speaker-independent bottleneck feature that captures phonetic content without speaker identity. Understanding its structure and how it encodes segmental vs. prosodic information is crucial for grasping the VQ-DR mechanism.
- Quick check question: What dimension is the BNF matrix extracted from the TDNN-F model, and how does this compare to the original PPG dimension?

### Vector Quantization (VQ) and Information Bottlenecks
- Why needed here: VQ is the key mechanism for removing prosodic information and improving speaker transfer. Understanding how VQ creates information bottlenecks and how codeword selection works is essential for implementing and debugging this system.
- Quick check question: How does the duplicate removal step after VQ specifically help with prosody transfer?

### Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) Models with Multiple Encoders
- Why needed here: The core architecture combines three different encoders (PPG, speaker, prosody) into a single decoder. Understanding how multi-encoder seq2seq models work and how they learn to combine different information sources is critical for this system.
- Quick check question: What training strategy is used to ensure the seq2seq model learns to use the prosody embedding rather than inferring prosody from the BNFs?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Acoustic Model (AM) -> Vector Quantization (VQ) -> Duplicate Removal (DR) -> Sequence-to-Sequence Model -> HiFiGAN Vocoder

### Critical path
Speech → AM → VQ+DR → seq2seq (with speaker+prosody embeddings) → Mel-spectrogram → HiFiGAN → Waveform

### Design tradeoffs
- VQ codebook size vs. synthesis quality (128 codewords optimal)
- Reduction factor in seq2seq vs. memory/computation vs. quality
- ECAPA-TDNN vs. simpler prosody encoder for prosody extraction

### Failure signatures
- Poor prosody transfer: Check if DR is working correctly, verify prosody encoder training
- Poor speaker transfer: Check VQ codebook quality, verify speaker encoder training
- Bad synthesis quality: Check if VQ codebook size is appropriate, verify HiFiGAN vocoder

### First 3 experiments
1. Run as auto-encoder (U1=U2=U3) and measure MCD for different VQ codebook sizes to find optimal configuration
2. Test speaker transfer by converting between known speakers and measuring speaker embedding distances
3. Test prosody transfer by converting with different prosody references and analyzing duration/F0 statistics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the neural mechanisms underlying the critical period for native-like pronunciation acquisition in L2 learners, and how do they differ from mechanisms involved in other aspects of language learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "unlike other aspects of L2 learning (e.g., vocabulary, grammar, writing), which can be acquired well into adulthood, achieving native-like pronunciation is difficult past a critical period because of the neuro-musculatory basis of speech production."
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the existence of a critical period, it does not delve into the specific neural mechanisms or provide detailed explanations of how these mechanisms differ from those involved in other language learning aspects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Neuroimaging studies comparing brain activity during pronunciation learning versus other language learning tasks in both children and adults, along with longitudinal studies tracking pronunciation development over time.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do segmental features and prosodic cues interact with each other in non-native speech to affect comprehensibility, and are there cases where improving one aspect may negatively impact the other?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the separate effects of segmental features and prosody on comprehensibility, but does not explore their potential interactions or trade-offs.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments isolate segmental and prosodic features, but do not investigate how changes in one domain might influence the other or create competing effects on comprehensibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Perceptual studies manipulating both segmental and prosodic features simultaneously in various combinations, along with acoustic analyses of how changes in one domain correlate with changes in the other.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do listener characteristics such as language proficiency, cultural background, and exposure to non-native speech influence the perception of comprehensibility in non-native speech, and can these factors explain individual differences in comprehensibility ratings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that "future research could examine how various speech attributes affect comprehensibility in non-native listeners" and mentions listener factors like "language proficiency, cultural background and exposure to non-native speech" as areas for investigation.
- Why unresolved: The current study only used native English speakers as listeners and did not control for or analyze the impact of individual listener differences on comprehensibility ratings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with diverse listener groups varying in language background and experience with non-native speech, along with statistical analyses correlating listener characteristics with comprehensibility ratings.

## Limitations
- The finding that segmental features have a larger impact on comprehensibility than prosodic characteristics contradicts prior research and may be limited by the specific corpus used (L2-ARCTIC contains read speech rather than spontaneous conversation)
- The VQ-DR mechanism for removing prosodic information lacks direct empirical validation to demonstrate that duplicate removal successfully eliminates prosodic timing information
- The study only evaluated comprehensibility for native listeners, not for other non-native listeners who might rely more heavily on prosodic cues

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The accent conversion system successfully combines segmentals, voice quality, and prosody from different utterances to produce intelligible speech (supported by MCD scores of 5.88 and MOS of 3.33).

- **Medium Confidence**: The VQ-DR mechanism effectively removes prosodic information from segmental representations and improves speaker transfer (supported by objective speaker embedding distances and MCD comparisons).

- **Low Confidence**: Segmental features have a larger impact on non-native speech comprehensibility than prosodic characteristics (based solely on perceptual listening tests without comparison to spontaneous speech or non-native listener evaluations).

## Next Checks

1. **Test the VQ-DR mechanism directly**: Design an experiment that quantifies how much prosodic timing information remains in the VQ'd BNF sequences before and after duplicate removal, using duration-based metrics on the synthesized speech.

2. **Validate on spontaneous speech**: Replicate the comprehensibility experiments using a corpus of spontaneous non-native speech to determine if the segmental-vs-prosodic importance ratio holds for more natural speaking styles.

3. **Test with non-native listeners**: Conduct the same ABX listening tests with non-native English speakers to determine if comprehensibility judgments differ from native listeners, particularly for prosodic variations.
