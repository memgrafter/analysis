# Weak-to-Strong Generalization Through the Data-Centric Lens

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.03881
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03881
- Reference count: 40
- Authors propose overlap density mechanism for weak-to-strong generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a data-centric framework for weak-to-strong generalization that focuses on the overlap density mechanism. The core insight is that generalization depends on data points containing both easy patterns (learnable by weak models) and hard patterns (only learnable by strong models). The authors propose a practical overlap detection algorithm and a UCB-based data selection method to identify data sources with maximum overlap density. Their approach bridges theoretical understanding with practical implementation, showing that controlled overlap density can significantly improve weak-to-strong generalization across various datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to weak-to-strong generalization centered on the overlap density mechanism. They introduce a practical overlap detection algorithm that identifies data points containing both easy patterns (learnable by weak models) and hard patterns (only learnable by strong models). A UCB-based data selection method is then used to select data sources with maximum overlap density. Theoretically, they prove that generalization benefit is a function of overlap density and provide a regret bound for their data selection algorithm. Empirically, they validate their approach across 19 LLM datasets and 9 weak supervision datasets, demonstrating improved data efficiency over random sampling methods.

## Key Results
- Controlled overlap density improves weak-to-strong generalization
- Data selection algorithm shows enhanced data efficiency over random sampling
- Overlap ratio estimation improves from ~0.4 to ~0.7 after 25 rounds in Amazon Polarity experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The overlap density mechanism works by identifying data points that contain both easy patterns (learnable by weak models) and hard patterns (only learnable by strong models). This dual-pattern structure creates a learning bridge where weak models can handle the easy components while strong models can learn the additional hard components. The data selection algorithm then prioritizes sources with high overlap density, maximizing the generalization benefit by focusing on data that enables this transfer of learning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- Overlap density concept: Understanding how data points containing both easy and hard patterns enable generalization transfer
- UCB-based bandit algorithms: Multi-armed bandit framework for sequential data selection
- Feature orthogonality assumption: Weak and strong models learn complementary feature representations
- Regret bounds: Theoretical guarantees on the performance of data selection algorithms
- Pattern difficulty hierarchy: Classification of patterns based on model learning capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data sources -> Overlap detection algorithm -> UCB-based selector -> Training data for strong model

**Critical path:** Data source evaluation -> Overlap density calculation -> Bandit algorithm update -> Data selection decision

**Design tradeoffs:** The algorithm trades computational complexity for improved generalization. While overlap detection adds overhead, it enables more efficient data utilization compared to random sampling.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance may occur when weak and strong models share feature representations, when easy and hard patterns conflict within data points, or when data sources are noisy or adversarial.

**First experiments:** 1) Validate overlap detection on synthetic datasets with known pattern distributions, 2) Test data selection algorithm with varying levels of data quality, 3) Compare performance against random sampling under controlled conditions
