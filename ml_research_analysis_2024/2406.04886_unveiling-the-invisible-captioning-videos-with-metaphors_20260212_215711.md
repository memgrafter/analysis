# Unveiling the Invisible: Captioning Videos with Metaphors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04886
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04886
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Introduced VMCD dataset and GIT-LLaVA model for video metaphor captioning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the novel task of Video Metaphor Captioning (VMC) and the VMCD dataset containing 705 videos with 2115 human-written captions. The authors propose GIT-LLaVA, a low-resource model that uses a frozen video encoder with an LLM to generate metaphor captions. They also introduce the Average Concept Distance (ACD) metric to evaluate metaphor creativity. Experiments show that existing video-language models struggle with this task, while GIT-LLaVA achieves comparable performance to SoTA models despite limited pretraining data.

## Method Summary
The authors develop GIT-LLaVA, which uses a frozen Generative Image-to-Text (GIT) model as a video encoder and a Vicuna LLM for caption generation. The model is trained in two stages: pretraining on synthetic metaphor-image pairs from HAIVMet and MSCOCO datasets, followed by finetuning on the VMCD dataset. A lightweight MLP mapping network translates the frozen video encoder's representations to the LLM's embedding space. The ACD metric evaluates metaphor creativity by measuring semantic distance between primary and secondary concepts while ensuring caption fluency.

## Key Results
- Existing video-language models struggle significantly with video metaphor captioning
- GIT-LLaVA achieves comparable performance to SoTA models despite using a frozen video encoder
- ACD metric effectively distinguishes creative metaphors from obvious comparisons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Mapping network translates frozen video encoder's internal representation to LLM's embedding space
- Pre-trained video captioning model's decoder state contains sufficient video information
- Core assumption: The frozen GIT model produces video representations that capture temporal and semantic information

### Mechanism 2
- Pretraining on synthetic metaphor-image pairs provides foundational metaphor understanding
- Model learns to map literal image captions to metaphorical captions using HAIVMet dataset
- Core assumption: Learning to generate metaphors from static images transfers to understanding metaphors in videos

### Mechanism 3
- ACD metric effectively evaluates metaphor creativity by measuring semantic distance between compared concepts
- ACD combines semantic similarity of primary and secondary concepts with BERTScore
- Core assumption: Creative metaphors require comparing concepts with lower semantic similarity while maintaining caption quality

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Metaphor structure and template (Primary Concept is as property as Secondary Concept)
  - Why needed here: Task requires generating captions following specific template
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the primary concept, secondary concept, and property in "The car is as fast as a cheetah"?

- Concept: Semantic similarity and embedding spaces
  - Why needed here: ACD metric uses cosine similarity between concept embeddings
  - Quick check question: What does it mean when two word embeddings have high cosine similarity?

- Concept: Video frame sampling and temporal representation
  - Why needed here: Model samples frames from videos to create input for video encoder
  - Quick check question: Why might sampling 2 frames from start, middle, and end be better than 6 consecutive frames?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video input → Frame sampler → GIT video encoder (frozen) → MLP mapping network → Vicuna LLM (fine-tuned) → Metaphor caption output
- Critical path: Frame sampling → GIT encoding → Mapping network → LLM generation → ACD evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frozen video encoder vs. fine-tuning: Saves computational resources but limits adaptation
  - Simple MLP vs. complex transformer: Faster training but may miss complex relationships
  - Image pretraining vs. video pretraining: More data available but potential domain gap
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor ACD scores with high BERTScore: Model generating obvious comparisons
  - High ACD with low BERTScore: Model generating creative but incoherent captions
  - Low scores across all metrics: Fundamental understanding problem
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run inference with single frame input to verify baseline performance drop
  2. Test mapping network with random weights to confirm it's learning
  3. Evaluate ACD metric on known metaphor examples to validate scoring

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How do audio cues contribute to metaphor understanding in videos, and can their inclusion improve metaphor captioning performance?
2. How effective is the ACD metric for evaluating metaphors in free-form text generation tasks, and what methods could be used to automatically identify primary and secondary concepts?
3. What is the impact of different pretraining data strategies on metaphor captioning performance, and how does synthetic data generation compare to using existing metaphor datasets?

## Limitations

- ACD metric effectiveness needs more rigorous validation through correlation studies with human evaluations
- Pretraining approach using static images may have limitations when temporal dynamics are crucial
- Limited ablation studies on critical components of the low-resource model

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core contribution of introducing VMCD dataset and VMC task is well-supported

**Medium Confidence:** GIT-LLaVA model architecture and performance claims are demonstrated but need more extensive validation

**Low Confidence:** ACD metric's effectiveness as a comprehensive evaluation tool needs more rigorous validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic correlation study between ACD scores and human judgments across diverse metaphor categories
2. Evaluate model's performance with different frame sampling strategies to understand temporal information's effect
3. Test model's performance on video metaphors that heavily rely on temporal dynamics or audio cues to assess domain gap
