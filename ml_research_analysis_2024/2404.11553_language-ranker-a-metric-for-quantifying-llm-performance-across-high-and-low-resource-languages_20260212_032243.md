# Language Ranker: A Metric for Quantifying LLM Performance Across High and Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.11553
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11553
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Key outcome**: Introduces Language Ranker, a novel intrinsic metric using cosine similarity between English and target language embeddings to quantify LLM performance disparities across high and low-resource languages.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Language Ranker, a novel intrinsic metric for evaluating and ranking large language model (LLM) performance across diverse languages, with particular focus on low-resource languages. The method leverages internal LLM representations by comparing embeddings of target languages against an English baseline using cosine similarity. Experiments on five state-of-the-art LLMs (LlaMa2, LlaMa3, Qwen, Mistral-v0.1, and Gemma) demonstrate that high-resource languages exhibit higher similarity scores with English, while low-resource languages show lower scores, validating the metric's effectiveness in capturing performance disparities. The research reveals a strong correlation between LLM performance and the proportion of languages in the pre-training corpus, providing insights into how training data distribution impacts multilingual capabilities.

## Method Summary
The Language Ranker metric evaluates LLM performance by computing cosine similarity between internal language representations. The method uses English as a reference baseline and measures how closely other languages align with it in the model's embedding space. This intrinsic approach requires no external task-specific data or labels, making it computationally efficient compared to traditional extrinsic evaluation methods. The metric was applied to five state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple languages, revealing systematic differences in how high and low-resource languages are represented within the models' internal structures.

## Key Results
- High-resource languages consistently show higher cosine similarity scores with English embeddings compared to low-resource languages across all tested LLMs
- Strong correlation observed between the proportion of a language in the pre-training corpus and the model's performance on that language
- High-resource languages are more evenly distributed in the embedding space, while low-resource languages are narrowly clustered
- The proposed metric effectively quantifies language-specific performance disparities without requiring task-specific evaluation data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Language Ranker metric works by exploiting the fact that LLMs learn language representations in their embedding space during pre-training. When a model is trained on multilingual data, the quality and quantity of training data for each language directly influences how well that language is represented in the embedding space. By measuring cosine similarity between English (typically the dominant training language) and target languages, the metric captures the degree of alignment and separation in the embedding space. Languages with more training data and better representation will have embeddings that align more closely with English, while underrepresented languages will show weaker alignment, manifesting as lower similarity scores.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cosine similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, indicating their directional alignment (why needed: quantifies embedding similarity; quick check: values range from -1 to 1, with 1 meaning identical direction)
- **Embedding space**: The high-dimensional vector space where language representations are learned (why needed: captures semantic relationships between languages; quick check: languages with similar features cluster together)
- **Pre-training data distribution**: The proportion and diversity of languages in the training corpus (why needed: directly impacts language representation quality; quick check: languages with more data show better performance)
- **Intrinsic evaluation**: Assessment methods using internal model representations without external tasks (why needed: provides efficient, task-agnostic evaluation; quick check: correlates with downstream performance)
- **Multilingual LLM architecture**: Model design choices for handling multiple languages (why needed: affects cross-lingual transfer capabilities; quick check: transformer-based models show varying performance across languages)
- **Language resource asymmetry**: The disparity in available training data between high and low-resource languages (why needed: creates performance gaps in multilingual models; quick check: measurable through embedding similarity)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM Pre-training -> Embedding Space Formation -> Language Representation -> Cosine Similarity Computation -> Language Ranker Score

**Critical Path**
The critical path is: Pre-training corpus composition → Embedding space learning → Language representation quality → Cosine similarity measurement → Performance ranking

**Design Tradeoffs**
The metric trades off task-specific accuracy for computational efficiency and language-agnostic evaluation. While extrinsic task-based evaluation provides direct performance measures, Language Ranker offers rapid assessment without requiring labeled datasets for each language, making it scalable for diverse linguistic evaluation.

**Failure Signatures**
Potential failure modes include: languages with different scripts or typological features may show artificially low similarity despite good task performance; the English baseline assumption may not hold for models trained with different dominant languages; and the metric may not capture performance on specialized domains where training data distribution differs from general web data.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Compute Language Ranker scores for a diverse set of languages spanning different families and scripts to validate metric robustness
2. Correlate Language Ranker scores with actual downstream task performance metrics across languages
3. Evaluate the metric's effectiveness across different LLM architectures and training objectives to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The metric assumes English-centric embedding alignment is a valid measure of multilingual capability, which may not hold universally across different language families
- The study evaluates only five LLMs and five languages, limiting generalizability to the broader landscape of multilingual LLMs and languages
- Correlation between training data proportion and performance may be influenced by confounding factors such as language similarity to English or model architecture choices

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The observation that high-resource languages show higher cosine similarity with English embeddings than low-resource languages is well-supported by experimental data and aligns with expected training data imbalances.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that Language Ranker effectively quantifies language-specific performance disparities is supported but requires validation across more diverse languages and models, as well as correlation with extrinsic task performance metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: The correlation between training data proportion and LLM performance is statistically observed, but causation cannot be definitively established due to potential confounding variables.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the Language Ranker metric on additional languages spanning different language families and typological features to assess robustness beyond the current Indo-European and major world languages.

2. **Task-based correlation**: Compare Language Ranker scores with actual downstream task performance (e.g., translation quality, classification accuracy) across languages to validate whether embedding similarity correlates with real-world capabilities.

3. **Model architecture analysis**: Evaluate whether the metric's effectiveness varies across different LLM architectures (transformers, recurrent models) and training objectives to determine if results are architecture-dependent.
