# Scaling Technology Acceptance Analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) Annotation Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.00702
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00702
- Reference count: 29
- This paper explores using LLMs to analyze user-generated content for technology acceptance assessment, offering a scalable alternative to traditional surveys.

## Executive Summary
This research investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) as an annotation system to analyze user-generated content for technology acceptance assessment. The authors designed an LLM annotation system that transforms online reviews into structured data based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Through two studies, they validated the system's consistency and accuracy, demonstrating that LLM annotations can achieve agreement with human expert annotations comparable to or better than inter-expert agreement for UTAUT variables.

## Method Summary
The researchers designed an LLM annotation system using a custom prompt based on the UTAUT model, asking GPT-4 to evaluate 15 refurbished iPhone 13 reviews using a 5-point Likert scale for UTAUT variables. They conducted multiple annotation runs at different temperature settings (1.0 and 0.25) and compared the LLM outputs with human expert annotations from three PhDs in information systems. Consistency was measured using weighted percentage agreement (WPA) within LLM runs and between LLM and expert annotations.

## Key Results
- LLM annotations showed moderate-to-strong consistency that improved with lower temperature settings
- LLM annotations achieved close agreement with human expert annotations, outperforming agreement between experts for UTAUT variables
- The system provides a practical alternative to traditional survey methods for technology acceptance assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLM annotation systems can convert unstructured user reviews into structured UTAUT-based numeric data at scale by processing each review individually using a custom prompt that instructs evaluation on UTAUT variables using a Likert scale, then outputting structured numeric annotations.

### Mechanism 2
Lowering the LLM's temperature improves annotation consistency without compromising quality by reducing output randomness, leading to more stable annotations across runs.

### Mechanism 3
LLM annotations achieve agreement with human experts comparable to or better than inter-expert agreement for UTAUT variables, indicating that LLMs can serve as reliable proxies for human judgment in technology acceptance assessment.

## Foundational Learning

- UTAUT model concepts: Why needed - The LLM annotation system is explicitly designed to map reviews to UTAUT variables, so understanding these constructs is essential for prompt design and evaluation. Quick check - What are the four main constructs in UTAUT, and how do they relate to technology adoption?

- Natural Language Processing fundamentals: Why needed - The system relies on LLMs to interpret natural language sentiment and map it to numeric scales, so understanding how LLMs process text is critical. Quick check - How do LLMs differ from traditional sentiment analysis models in terms of context understanding?

- Prompt engineering for LLMs: Why needed - The effectiveness of the annotation system depends on the prompt's ability to guide the LLM to produce consistent, relevant outputs. Quick check - What are the key components of an effective LLM annotation prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input reviews → Prompt template → LLM inference → Output parsing (regex) → Dataframe of UTAUT scores
- Critical path: Review ingestion → Prompt execution → Annotation extraction → Consistency validation → Expert comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Flexibility in prompt design vs. consistency; single-run convenience vs. multi-run mode-based reliability
- Failure signatures: High annotation range (>2), low mode frequency, poor WPA scores, low agreement with human experts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the LLM on a small set of reviews with temperature 1, collect outputs, and compute WPA within runs
  2. Lower temperature to 0.25, rerun, and compare mode consistency and range
  3. Compare LLM annotations with human expert annotations on the same review set, compute WPA

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of LLM annotation systems compare across different technology domains beyond iPhone reviews? The study only tested the system on refurbished iPhone 13 reviews from Amazon, which may not generalize to other technology products or domains.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal balance between model temperature and annotation quality for LLM annotation systems? The study only tested one reduced temperature (0.25), leaving the optimal temperature range for balancing consistency and annotation quality unclear.

### Open Question 3
How do LLM annotation systems compare to traditional survey methods in terms of predictive validity for actual technology adoption behavior? The authors suggest LLM annotation systems could replace traditional surveys but do not test whether LLM-derived technology acceptance scores predict actual adoption as well as survey-based scores.

## Limitations

- Small sample size of only 15 reviews limits statistical power and generalizability
- Focus on refurbished iPhone 13 reviews on Amazon may not generalize to other product categories or platforms
- Limited human expert pool of only three PhDs may not capture the full range of human interpretation

## Confidence

- High confidence: The LLM annotation system can convert unstructured user reviews into structured UTAUT-based numeric data at scale
- Medium confidence: Lowering LLM temperature improves annotation consistency
- Medium confidence: LLM annotations achieve agreement with human experts comparable to or better than inter-expert agreement for UTAUT variables

## Next Checks

1. Scale validation test: Replicate the study using a larger sample of 100+ reviews across multiple product categories and platforms to assess generalizability and statistical significance of findings

2. Prompt engineering experiment: Systematically test alternative prompt formulations and variable framing approaches to identify optimal prompt design for consistent UTAUT annotation across different LLMs and domains

3. Expert diversity assessment: Expand the human expert pool to include practitioners from different domains to better understand the range of human interpretation and compare against LLM performance
