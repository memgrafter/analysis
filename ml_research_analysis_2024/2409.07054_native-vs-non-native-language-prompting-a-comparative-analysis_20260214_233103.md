# Native vs Non-Native Language Prompting: A Comparative Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.07054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07054
- Reference count: 40
- Non-native English prompts consistently outperform native Arabic prompts across all models and tasks

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how prompt language affects Arabic NLP task performance using three prompting strategies: native Arabic, non-native English, and mixed language approaches. The researchers conducted 197 experiments across 11 NLP tasks on 12 Arabic datasets using GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-8b, and Jais-13b models. Results demonstrate that non-native English prompts consistently achieve superior performance compared to native Arabic prompts, with mixed prompts showing intermediate results. The findings challenge assumptions about language-specific model optimization and reveal significant performance variations based on prompt language choice.

## Method Summary
The researchers evaluated three prompting strategies across three large language models on 11 Arabic NLP tasks using 12 datasets. They compared native Arabic prompts, non-native English prompts, and mixed language prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot configurations. The study used GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-8b, and Jais-13b models, conducting comprehensive experiments to measure performance differences across task types including classification, question answering, and natural language inference.

## Key Results
- Non-native English prompts consistently outperform native Arabic prompts across all models and tasks
- Mixed prompts show intermediate performance, with Llama-3.1-8b achieving 7% better results than non-native and 8% better than native prompts
- GPT-4o performs best overall, while Jais-13b shows surprisingly low performance with native Arabic prompts despite being Arabic-centric
- Few-shot prompting improves results compared to zero-shot, though performance varies by dataset and task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that language-specific prompting strategies significantly impact NLP model performance, with non-native English prompts consistently outperforming native Arabic prompts across all tested models. This suggests that the training data distribution and multilingual capabilities of large language models may favor English-centric prompting patterns, even for Arabic-specific tasks. The superior performance of mixed prompts with certain models indicates that code-switching strategies can leverage complementary strengths from multiple languages. The variation in few-shot vs zero-shot performance highlights how additional context and examples can help models overcome language-specific limitations in their pretraining.

## Foundational Learning

**Multilingual Prompting**: Understanding how different languages affect model performance is crucial for optimizing NLP systems across language pairs. Quick check: Test prompting strategies across multiple language pairs to validate generalizability.

**Few-shot vs Zero-shot Learning**: The study demonstrates that providing examples can significantly improve model performance, particularly for challenging language-specific tasks. Quick check: Analyze which task types benefit most from few-shot examples in different language configurations.

**Model Architecture Differences**: The varying performance across GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-8b, and Jais-13b suggests that model architecture and training data significantly influence language-specific prompting effectiveness. Quick check: Compare model pretraining corpora to understand performance differences.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data preprocessing -> Prompt engineering (native/mixed/non-native) -> Model inference (GPT-4o/Llama-3.1-8b/Jais-13b) -> Performance evaluation -> Statistical analysis

**Critical Path**: Prompt selection → Model execution → Result evaluation → Comparative analysis across strategies and models

**Design Tradeoffs**: Language-specific optimization vs. multilingual generalization, model-specific fine-tuning vs. general prompting approaches, zero-shot simplicity vs. few-shot accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: Jais-13b underperformance with native prompts despite Arabic training suggests potential implementation issues or data quality problems specific to native language processing

**First Experiments**: 1) Replicate experiments with additional Arabic datasets to verify consistency, 2) Test mixed prompts with different language ratios, 3) Evaluate performance on non-Arabic languages to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses exclusively on Arabic as the native language, leaving uncertainty about whether similar patterns hold for other language pairs
- Only three models tested (GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-8b, Jais-13b), limiting insights into how model architecture affects language-specific prompting
- 197 experiments cover specific NLP tasks and 12 Arabic datasets, which may not represent full diversity of NLP applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Non-native English prompts outperform native Arabic prompts across all tested models and tasks

**Medium confidence**: Mixed prompts show intermediate performance, as this pattern may vary with different language combinations

**Medium confidence**: Few-shot prompting improves results compared to zero-shot, though this varies significantly by dataset and task

## Next Checks
1. Test the same prompting strategies across additional language pairs (e.g., Spanish-English, Chinese-English) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate a broader range of model families including multilingual models not specifically trained on Arabic
3. Conduct error analysis on the datasets where mixed prompts show the largest performance gains to understand what linguistic phenomena benefit from code-switching
