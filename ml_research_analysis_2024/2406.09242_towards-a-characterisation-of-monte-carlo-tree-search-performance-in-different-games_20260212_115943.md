# Towards a Characterisation of Monte-Carlo Tree Search Performance in Different Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09242
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09242
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Initial predictive modeling using Random Forest regressors on a dataset of 268,386 MCTS game plays achieves RMSE of 0.491 and MAE of 0.434

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a large-scale empirical study aimed at characterizing Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) performance across different games. The authors construct a dataset of 268,386 game plays between 61 different MCTS agents across 1494 games, using the Ludii general game system to represent games with 809 features. Through Random Forest modeling and SHAP analysis, they identify key patterns including the strong predictive power of player advantage from random play-outs and the consistently poor performance of early-terminating play-out strategies.

## Method Summary
The authors collect data from 268,386 game plays between 61 MCTS agents with different selection strategies, exploration constants, and play-out methods. Games are represented using 809 features from the Ludii framework. The dataset is filtered to focus on zero-sum two-player games, reducing it to 118,205 plays. Random Forest regressors are trained with default Scikit-learn settings using 1376-fold cross-validation, and SHAP analysis is applied to identify important predictive features.

## Key Results
- Random Forest models achieve RMSE of 0.491 and MAE of 0.434 in predicting MCTS performance
- Player advantage from random play-outs is a strong predictor of MCTS performance across game types
- Play-out strategies with early termination (0 or 4 moves) consistently perform poorly regardless of game type
- The dataset analysis reveals meaningful patterns in MCTS performance that vary by game characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Player advantage from random play-outs is a strong predictor of MCTS performance across game types.
- Mechanism: Random play-out outcomes capture fundamental game dynamics that MCTS can exploit regardless of specific selection strategy.
- Core assumption: The advantage in random play reflects meaningful game structure that MCTS can leverage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHAP analysis reveals that player advantage from random play-outs is a strong predictor of MCTS performance"
  - [section] "The top row shows that player 1 having a strong advantage (or disadvantage) against player 2—when measured from purely random play-outs—is also used by the model as a predictor of strong (or weak) performance for an MCTS-based player 1"
- Break condition: If a game's random play advantage doesn't reflect its actual strategic depth, this predictor would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Play-out strategies with early termination perform poorly regardless of game type.
- Mechanism: Early termination in play-outs (0 or 4 moves) provides insufficient information for accurate value estimation, leading to poor MCTS performance across all game types.
- Core assumption: Play-out depth is directly correlated with value estimation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "play-out strategies with early termination tend to perform poorly"
  - [section] "Rows 2–5 show that either player using a random play-out strategy with early termination after 0 or 4 moves tends to be a strong predictor for poor performance from that agent"
- Break condition: If early termination strategies are combined with strong heuristics, this mechanism might not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MCTS variants show consistent relative performance patterns across different game types.
- Mechanism: Despite different game structures, MCTS variants maintain similar relative strengths, suggesting underlying algorithmic properties that transcend specific game features.
- Core assumption: MCTS variant performance is more influenced by algorithmic properties than game-specific characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our ability to characterise and understand which variants work well or poorly in which games is still lacking"
  - [section] "the levels of playing strength of (modifications to) agents and algorithms are often assessed by averaging or otherwise aggregating over empirical results of experiments in sets of (rarely more than 10-30) different games"
- Break condition: If specific game types have unique characteristics that fundamentally change MCTS behavior, this mechanism would break.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature engineering for game representation
  - Why needed here: The dataset uses 809 features to represent games, requiring understanding of how different game properties map to predictive features
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the property "is this game deterministic?" in a feature vector?

- Concept: Monte-Carlo Tree Search variants
  - Why needed here: The study compares 60 different MCTS agents with different selection and play-out strategies
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between UCB1 and UCB1Tuned selection strategies?

- Concept: SHAP value interpretation
  - Why needed here: SHAP values are used to analyze which features most strongly predict MCTS performance
  - Quick check question: In SHAP visualization, what does the color red typically represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ludii game engine -> MCTS agent implementations -> Data collection pipeline -> Machine learning models -> SHAP analysis tools

- Critical path: Game simulation → Feature extraction → MCTS playouts → Outcome recording → Model training → SHAP analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. coverage (10% of scheduled jobs completed)
  - Feature complexity vs. model interpretability (809 features)
  - Agent diversity vs. computational feasibility (61 agents)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor model performance (high RMSE/MAE)
  - Inconsistent SHAP results across runs
  - Computational bottlenecks in game simulation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the Random Forest model training with default parameters to verify baseline performance
  2. Train a Decision Tree model with maximum depth 5 to examine simpler patterns
  3. Create a reduced feature set by removing highly correlated features and retrain models to check impact on performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the relationship between game features and MCTS performance be better characterized through analysis of feature combinations rather than individual features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "it is expected that a more thorough analysis, looking at combinations of features rather than one at a time, will help to make further progress towards our goal."
- Why unresolved: Current analysis using SHAP values only examines individual feature importance, and the paper acknowledges that combinations of features may reveal stronger patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis showing improved predictive accuracy when modeling interactions between game features, and identification of specific feature combinations that consistently predict MCTS performance across different game types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which specific game properties most strongly determine whether MCTS variants with early-terminating play-outs perform poorly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that "either player using a random play-out strategy with early termination after 0 or 4 moves tends to be a strong predictor for poor performance from that agent, irrespective of the game being played."
- Why unresolved: While early-termination play-outs are identified as problematic, the paper does not explore which game characteristics (e.g., game length, branching factor, presence of traps) specifically contribute to this poor performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis correlating early-termination play-out performance with specific game features like average game length, state complexity, or presence of strategic traps.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can player advantage from random play-outs reliably predict outcomes between MCTS agents across all game types, or are there specific game characteristics where this relationship breaks down?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors find that "player 1 having a strong advantage (or disadvantage) against player 2—when measured from purely random play-outs—is also used by the model as a predictor of strong (or weak) performance for an MCTS-based player 1."
- Why unresolved: The paper notes this relationship exists but does not explore its limitations or whether it holds across all game types, particularly in games where random play-outs might be less representative of strategic depth.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing showing the correlation between random play-out advantage and MCTS performance across different game categories (e.g., highly stochastic vs deterministic games, simple vs complex games).

## Limitations
- Analysis is based on only 10% of the scheduled jobs, potentially limiting representativeness
- The dataset focuses exclusively on zero-sum two-player games, limiting generalizability
- Computational cost remains a significant barrier to completing and validating the full dataset

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The general methodology of using SHAP analysis to identify important features and the observation that early termination play-outs perform poorly are well-supported by the data.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific claim that player advantage from random play-outs is a strong predictor across all game types, as this requires more extensive validation across the full dataset.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that MCTS variants maintain consistent relative performance patterns, as this is based on partial dataset analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Complete the full dataset generation to verify if the observed patterns hold across all 268,386 planned game plays, particularly examining if the player advantage feature remains consistently important.
2. Conduct ablation studies by systematically removing subsets of the 809 features to determine which combinations provide the most predictive power while maintaining model interpretability.
3. Perform cross-validation across different game genres (e.g., connection games, territory games, race games) to test whether the identified performance patterns are consistent across different game type categories or if they vary significantly by genre.
