# Simplicity in Complexity : Explaining Visual Complexity using Deep Segmentation Models

## Quick Facts

- A simple linear model using segmentation-derived features predicts subjective visual complexity ratings with Spearman correlations of 0.73-0.89 across six datasets

## Executive Summary
This study develops a simple linear model to predict subjective visual complexity ratings of naturalistic images using two features: the number of segments (num_seg) and the number of named semantic classes (num_class) extracted via state-of-the-art segmentation models (SAM and FC-CLIP). These features are square-root transformed and linearly combined to estimate complexity. The model achieves strong performance (Spearman correlations 0.73-0.89) across six diverse image datasets, outperforming handcrafted feature baselines and matching supervised CNN baselines. The approach provides an interpretable, generalizable account of perceived complexity while requiring minimal parameter tuning.

## Method Summary
The method employs a linear regression model that predicts subjective complexity ratings from two segmentation-derived features: the number of segments identified by SAM and the number of semantic classes identified by FC-CLIP. Both features are square-root transformed before being combined linearly. The model is trained and validated across six diverse image datasets containing subjective complexity ratings. For images with high symmetry or regularity that the basic model struggles with, an additional patch-symmetry feature is incorporated as a partial solution.

## Key Results
- Linear model achieves Spearman correlations of 0.73-0.89 across six diverse image datasets
- Outperforms handcrafted feature baselines while matching supervised CNN baseline performance
- Model fails systematically on highly symmetric or structured images, partially addressed by adding patch-symmetry feature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works because it captures fundamental perceptual dimensions of visual complexity through segmentation-derived features. The number of segments reflects how an image decomposes into distinct regions, while the number of semantic classes captures categorical diversity. These features align with how humans perceive and process visual information - we naturally segment scenes into objects and regions, and categorize them semantically. The square-root transformation appropriately scales these features to match human perceptual scaling of complexity.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Segmentation model outputs as perceptual features** - Why needed: To bridge computational vision with human perception of complexity. Quick check: Verify that SAM and FC-CLIP outputs correlate with human segmentation judgments.
2. **Square-root transformation of count features** - Why needed: To match human perceptual scaling which often follows logarithmic or power-law relationships. Quick check: Compare model performance with and without transformation.
3. **Linear combination of features** - Why needed: To maintain interpretability while capturing essential complexity dimensions. Quick check: Test whether non-linear combinations improve performance significantly.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
SAM -> num_seg -> Linear Model
FC-CLIP -> num_class -> Linear Model
Patch-symmetry feature -> Linear Model -> Complexity Prediction

**Critical Path:**
Segmentation outputs → Feature transformation → Linear combination → Complexity prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Simple linear model vs. complex non-linear models: Favors interpretability and generalizability
- Two main features vs. many handcrafted features: Reduces complexity while maintaining performance
- Square-root transformation vs. raw counts: Better matches human perceptual scaling

**Failure Signatures:**
- Systematic underestimation on highly symmetric images
- Performance drops on images with unusual semantic distributions
- Overfitting risk when training on small, homogeneous datasets

**First Experiments:**
1. Test model on images specifically selected for high symmetry to characterize failure modes
2. Compare performance using features from multiple segmentation models (not just SAM and FC-CLIP)
3. Evaluate whether adding additional perceptual features (color diversity, texture complexity) improves performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Systematic failure on highly symmetric or structured images despite patch-symmetry fix
- Performance depends on quality and limitations of SAM and FC-CLIP segmentation models
- Limited to complexity dimensions captured by segmentation - may miss other perceptual aspects

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core linear model performance and generalization across datasets
- Medium confidence: Interpretability claims and feature importance interpretations
- Medium confidence: Symmetry feature as a complete solution for structured images

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on additional image types specifically selected for high symmetry and regularity to better characterize failure modes
2. Evaluate whether combining features from multiple segmentation models (beyond just SAM and FC-CLIP) improves robustness
3. Conduct psychophysical experiments to validate that the model's complexity predictions align with human perceptual judgments in controlled settings
