# Identifying Task Groupings for Multi-Task Learning Using Pointwise V-Usable Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12774
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-task learning (MTL) outperforms single-task learning (STL) when tasks are grouped using pointwise V-usable information (PVI)

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel method to identify optimal task groupings for multi-task learning in NLP by leveraging pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI measures how much usable information a dataset provides to a given model, estimating task difficulty. The core hypothesis is that tasks with statistically similar PVI distributions are sufficiently related to benefit from joint learning, thereby avoiding negative transfer. Experiments across 15 datasets in general, biomedical, and clinical domains using RoBERTa-large and Bio+Clinical BERT show that PVI-guided groupings outperform two state-of-the-art baselines and consistently match or surpass single-task learning performance across most tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses pointwise V-usable information (PVI) to measure the statistical similarity between tasks by estimating how much usable information each dataset provides to a given model. Tasks with similar PVI distributions are grouped together for multi-task learning, under the hypothesis that statistically related tasks benefit from joint learning while avoiding negative transfer. The approach was validated across 15 datasets spanning general, biomedical, and clinical domains using standard pre-trained models like RoBERTa-large and Bio+Clinical BERT. Task groupings were evaluated against baselines using task embedding and surrogate models, with performance measured against single-task learning baselines.

## Key Results
- PVI-guided task groupings outperformed two state-of-the-art baselines (task embedding and surrogate models)
- Consistently matched or surpassed single-task learning (STL) performance across most tasks
- Grouping tasks with dissimilar PVI estimates led to degraded performance, validating the approach
- MTL with PVI-guided groupings achieved competitive results with fewer parameters compared to fine-tuning separate models for each task
- Large language models (Llama 2, Llama 3, GPT-4) were less effective on domain-specific tasks, supporting the value of the proposed method

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by using PVI to quantify the statistical similarity between tasks based on how much usable information each dataset provides to a given model. Tasks with similar PVI distributions are considered sufficiently related to benefit from joint learning, while dissimilar tasks are kept separate to avoid negative transfer. This statistical approach provides a theoretically grounded way to identify task relationships that traditional heuristics or embedding-based methods might miss.

## Foundational Learning

**Pointwise V-Usable Information (PVI)**: A measure of how much usable information a dataset provides to a given model, estimating task difficulty.
- Why needed: To quantify task similarity beyond surface-level features
- Quick check: Verify PVI estimates correlate with known task difficulty metrics

**Multi-Task Learning (MTL)**: Joint training on multiple related tasks to improve generalization and reduce training costs.
- Why needed: To leverage shared representations across related tasks
- Quick check: Compare parameter efficiency against single-task learning

**Negative Transfer**: Performance degradation that occurs when unrelated tasks are trained together.
- Why needed: To understand why task selection matters in MTL
- Quick check: Test performance when grouping dissimilar tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: PVI calculation -> Task similarity measurement -> Group formation -> MTL training

Critical path: Pre-trained model -> PVI estimation -> Similarity matrix computation -> Task grouping -> Joint training

Design tradeoffs: 
- Computational cost of PVI calculation vs. performance gains
- Fixed pre-trained models vs. task-specific fine-tuning before PVI estimation
- Statistical similarity vs. other task relationship factors (hierarchy, temporal dependencies)

Failure signatures:
- Performance degradation when grouping dissimilar tasks
- Computational overhead becoming prohibitive with large task sets
- Poor generalization to non-English or multimodal tasks

First experiments:
1. Test PVI-based groupings on non-English datasets
2. Compare against task hierarchy-aware grouping methods
3. Measure computational overhead scaling with 50+ tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes PVI estimates from fixed pre-trained models adequately capture task relationships across diverse domains
- Primarily validated on English NLP tasks, limiting generalization claims to other languages or modalities
- May oversimplify complex task interactions that depend on factors beyond information overlap
- Mechanism by which PVI prevents negative transfer is not fully explained
- Computational cost of PVI calculation could become prohibitive with large task sets

## Confidence

High: The experimental demonstration that PVI-guided groupings outperform random or dissimilar groupings, and that they match or exceed single-task learning performance across most tasks.

Medium: The claim that the method generalizes across domains (general, biomedical, clinical), given that domain-specific pre-trained models were used but the underlying task relationships may still be domain-dependent.

Low: The assertion that this approach is broadly applicable to "other domains and languages" beyond the tested English NLP tasks.

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on non-English datasets and multimodal tasks (e.g., vision-language) to verify cross-domain and cross-lingual generalization claims.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing PVI-based groupings against alternatives that incorporate task hierarchy, temporal relationships, or domain-specific fine-tuning before PVI estimation.

3. Measure and report the computational overhead of PVI calculation across large task sets, and test scalability with 50+ tasks to assess practical deployment limits.
