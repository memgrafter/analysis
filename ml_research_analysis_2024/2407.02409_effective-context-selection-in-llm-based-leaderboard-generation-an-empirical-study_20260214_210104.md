# Effective Context Selection in LLM-based Leaderboard Generation: An Empirical Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.02409
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02409
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Selective context (DocTAET) significantly outperforms comprehensive context (DocFULL) for LLM-based leaderboard generation

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how different context selections impact the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating AI research leaderboards by extracting (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score) quadruples from scholarly articles. The study introduces a novel text generation approach using instruction finetuning with the FLAN-T5 collection, contrasting it with traditional Natural Language Inference (NLI) methods. Three context types were empirically tested: DocTAET (selective sections), DocREC (results, experiments, conclusions), and DocFULL (entire paper). Results show that the DocTAET context significantly outperforms others, with Mistral 7B achieving 89% accuracy in few-shot and 95% in zero-shot settings for structured summary generation and leaderboard classification.

## Method Summary
The study employs instruction finetuning using the FLAN-T5 collection on Mistral 7B and Llama-2 7B models, with three context types (DocTAET, DocREC, DocFULL) extracted from scholarly articles. Training data consists of 7,987 papers with leaderboards and 4,401 without, using QLoRA for fine-tuning. The approach frames leaderboard generation as text generation rather than classification, using 15 instructions from SQuAD v2 and DROP datasets. Evaluation uses ROUGE metrics for structured summary generation, accuracy for classification, and F1/Precision for individual element extraction across three context types.

## Key Results
- DocTAET context achieved 89% accuracy in few-shot and 95% in zero-shot settings for leaderboard classification
- For structured summary generation, DocTAET outperformed DocFULL with higher ROUGE scores
- DocREC showed superior performance in extracting Tasks, Datasets, and Metrics, while DocTAET yielded better Score extraction
- Strong generalizability demonstrated in zero-shot settings using DocTAET and DocREC contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Selective context (DocTAET) reduces hallucination by limiting irrelevant information exposure
- Mechanism: By providing only the most relevant sections (title, abstract, experimental setup, tables) the model is less likely to generate misinformation or deviate from the task
- Core assumption: Irrelevant information in longer contexts directly contributes to hallucination
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Through experimentation with three distinct context types of varying selectivity and length, our study demonstrates the importance of effective context selection in enhancing LLM accuracy and reducing hallucinations"; [section] "However, longer contexts can serve as distractors [12], leading to decreased model accuracy and increased hallucination rates"
- Break condition: If task-relevant information is distributed across sections not included in DocTAET, the model may hallucinate missing details

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction finetuning with FLAN-T5 improves task alignment without requiring taxonomy
- Mechanism: The FLAN-T2 collection provides diverse task-specific instructions that align the model with domain-specific requirements of the SOTA task, enabling adaptation to new developments
- Core assumption: Instruction finetuning can compensate for lack of predefined taxonomy by teaching the model how to approach the task
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "By framing this challenge as a text generation objective and employing instruction finetuning with the FLAN-T5 collection, we introduce a novel method that surpasses traditional Natural Language Inference (NLI) approaches in adapting to new developments without a predefined taxonomy"; [section] "Instruction finetuning [10] is instrumental in this context, enabling our LLMs to better align with the domain-specific nuances of leaderboard data"
- Break condition: If the instruction set is insufficient to cover edge cases in the task, model performance will degrade

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Context length affects zero-shot generalizability performance
- Mechanism: DocTAET and DocREC contexts provide optimal balance between guidance and information density, enabling better zero-shot performance than comprehensive DocFULL
- Core assumption: There is an optimal context length that balances guidance with avoiding information overload
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The study also reveals strong generalizability in zero-shot settings using DocTAET and DocREC contexts"; [section] "DocFULL ended producing the longest contexts compared to DocTAET and DocREC, in an average length of 5,948 words"
- Break condition: If the task requires comprehensive understanding across the entire paper, DocFULL may be necessary despite lower zero-shot performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text generation as information extraction framework
  - Why needed here: Traditional NLI approaches require predefined taxonomies which limit adaptability to new developments
  - Quick check question: How does framing SOTA as text generation rather than classification/regression enable better handling of new metrics or tasks?

- Concept: Context selectivity vs. comprehensiveness tradeoff
  - Why needed here: Different context types (DocTAET, DocREC, DocFULL) have varying lengths and selectivity levels that impact model performance
  - Quick check question: Why might a more selective context (DocTAET) outperform a comprehensive one (DocFULL) despite containing less information?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning in LLM fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates generalizability to tasks without prior examples, requiring understanding of how models transfer knowledge
  - Quick check question: What architectural or training characteristics enable better zero-shot performance in LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collector → Prompt templates → LLM (Mistral 7B/Llama-2 7B) → QLoRA finetuning → Evaluation (ROUGE, F1, Precision)
- Critical path: Corpus construction → Instruction instantiation → Model finetuning → Context selection → Performance evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Shorter selective contexts (DocTAET) improve accuracy but may miss distributed information vs. longer contexts (DocFULL) provide completeness but introduce distraction
- Failure signatures: High hallucination rates indicate context selection issues; low precision suggests instruction alignment problems; poor zero-shot performance indicates overfitting
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare DocTAET vs DocFULL performance on structured summary generation task using ROUGE metrics
  2. Test individual element extraction (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score) precision across all three context types
  3. Evaluate zero-shot generalizability by testing on held-out tasks without any examples in training data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different context selection methods (DocTAET, DocREC, DocFULL) impact the performance of LLMs in extracting (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score) quadruples from scholarly articles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper empirically investigates the impact of different context types on LLM performance for leaderboard generation.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents results comparing these contexts, the underlying reasons for why certain contexts perform better than others are not fully explored or explained.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the characteristics of each context type and their correlation with LLM performance metrics could provide insights into the optimal context selection strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the effect of context length on the accuracy and hallucination rates of LLMs in information extraction tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that longer contexts can serve as distractors, leading to decreased model accuracy and increased hallucination rates.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between context length and LLM performance, leaving this question open for further investigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying context length while controlling for other factors could establish a clear relationship between context length and LLM performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of context affect the generalizability of language models to tasks without prior examples (zero-shot learning)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper addresses the generalizability of LLMs in handling new, unseen tasks in the context of zero-shot learning.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents results on zero-shot learning, the specific impact of context choice on generalizability is not fully explored or explained.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of LLM performance across different contexts in zero-shot learning scenarios could provide insights into the optimal context selection strategies for enhancing generalizability.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to AI/ML domain papers from ArXiv, raising questions about cross-domain generalizability
- Specific instructions from SQuGE and DROP datasets not fully specified in main text, creating reproducibility uncertainty
- Study doesn't address long-term stability with completely novel evaluation paradigms or emerging metrics

## Confidence
- High: Core finding that selective context (DocTAET) significantly outperforms comprehensive context (DocFULL) for structured summary generation and leaderboard classification
- Medium: Claims about generalizability and instruction finetuning effectiveness, though some details are unspecified
- Low: Long-term stability claims regarding handling of novel evaluation paradigms

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate the model on leaderboards from domains outside AI/ML (e.g., bioinformatics, materials science) to validate claims about handling diverse evaluation paradigms without predefined taxonomies.

2. **Temporal robustness analysis**: Test model performance on papers published after the training corpus cutoff to assess how well the instruction finetuning adapts to emerging metrics and evaluation standards.

3. **Ablation study on context components**: Systematically remove individual sections from DocTAET (e.g., abstract only, tables only, experimental setup only) to identify which components contribute most to the performance gains and better understand the hallucination reduction mechanism.
