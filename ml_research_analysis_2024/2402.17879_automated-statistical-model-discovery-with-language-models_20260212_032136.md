# Automated Statistical Model Discovery with Language Models
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17879
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-driven automated statistical model discovery can identify models comparable to human expert designs across various settings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for automated statistical model discovery using large language models (LLMs). The approach leverages LLMs to propose probabilistic models expressed as programs, which are then fit and evaluated using principled statistical techniques. This is done iteratively within a framework inspired by Box's Loop, where LLMs act as both modelers and domain experts. The method avoids the need for defining a domain-specific language or handcrafted search procedures, which are limitations of previous systems.

## Method Summary
The proposed method utilizes LLMs to propose probabilistic models expressed as programs, which are then fit and evaluated using principled statistical techniques. This process is carried out iteratively within a framework inspired by Box's Loop, with LLMs acting as both modelers and domain experts. The method does not require defining a domain-specific language or handcrafted search procedures, which are limitations of previous systems.

## Key Results
- The method can identify models on par with human expert-designed models across various settings
- Experiments demonstrate capabilities in searching within a restricted space of models, open-ended probabilistic model discovery, and improving expert models under natural language constraints
- Results highlight the potential of LLM-driven model discovery for accelerating scientific discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the broad knowledge and generative capabilities of LLMs to propose diverse statistical models, which are then rigorously evaluated using principled statistical techniques. By iterating within a Box's Loop-inspired framework, the method can refine and improve model proposals over time, converging towards high-quality solutions. The use of LLMs as both modelers and domain experts allows for a flexible and adaptable discovery process that can handle a wide range of statistical modeling tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
   - Why needed: LLMs serve as the core component for proposing diverse statistical models based on their broad knowledge base
   - Quick check: Verify that the LLM used has been pre-trained on a large corpus of statistical modeling literature and has demonstrated strong performance on related tasks

2. Probabilistic Programming
   - Why needed: Probabilistic programming allows for the expression of statistical models as executable code, enabling automated fitting and evaluation
   - Quick check: Ensure that the proposed models can be easily translated into a probabilistic programming language supported by the evaluation framework

3. Box's Loop
   - Why needed: Box's Loop provides an iterative framework for model discovery, refinement, and evaluation, which aligns well with the proposed LLM-driven approach
   - Quick check: Confirm that the iterative process converges to a satisfactory model within a reasonable number of iterations and that the stopping criteria are well-defined

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: LLM -> Model Proposal -> Model Fitting -> Model Evaluation -> Refinement (loop)
Critical path: The LLM proposes a model, which is then fit and evaluated using principled statistical techniques. Based on the evaluation results, the model is refined and the process repeats until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.
Design tradeoffs: The use of LLMs allows for a flexible and adaptable discovery process but relies heavily on the quality and breadth of the LLM's knowledge base. The iterative framework inspired by Box's Loop enables model refinement but may not always converge to the optimal solution.
Failure signatures: If the LLM's knowledge base is limited or biased, the proposed models may be suboptimal or miss important aspects of the problem domain. If the fitting or evaluation process is not robust, the iterative refinement may lead to poor convergence or suboptimal solutions.
First experiments:
1. Test the method on a synthetic dataset with a known ground truth model to assess its ability to recover the true model
2. Apply the method to a real-world dataset from a well-studied domain and compare the results with established models
3. Evaluate the method's performance on a range of statistical modeling tasks with varying complexity and dimensionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach relies heavily on the quality and breadth of the LLM's knowledge base, which may not cover all relevant statistical models or domain-specific nuances
- The iterative framework, while inspired by Box's Loop, may not always converge to the optimal model, especially in complex, high-dimensional spaces
- The experiments are limited in scope and may not fully represent the diversity of real-world statistical modeling challenges

## Confidence
- High: The method's ability to propose probabilistic models expressed as programs and fit them using principled statistical techniques is well-established
- Medium: The claim that the method can identify models on par with human expert-designed models is supported by the experiments but may not generalize to all domains and problem complexities
- Medium: The potential of LLM-driven model discovery for accelerating scientific discovery is plausible but requires further validation across a broader range of scientific domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive study comparing the proposed method with human experts across a wide range of statistical modeling problems, including both synthetic and real-world datasets from diverse domains
2. Investigate the impact of different LLM architectures, prompt engineering techniques, and stopping criteria on the method's performance and convergence properties
3. Assess the method's scalability and robustness by testing it on large-scale, high-dimensional problems and evaluating its performance in the presence of noisy or incomplete data
