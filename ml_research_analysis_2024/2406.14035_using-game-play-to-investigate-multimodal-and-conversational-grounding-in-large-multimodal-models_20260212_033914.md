# Using Game Play to Investigate Multimodal and Conversational Grounding in Large Multimodal Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.14035
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14035
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Commercial models (e.g., Claude-3.5, GPT-4o) achieved 80+ points vs ~30-40 for open models on 0-100 scale

## Executive Summary
This study develops a game-based evaluation framework to assess multimodal language models' capabilities in reference resolution, dialogue alignment, and map navigation. The framework uses three structured dialogue games implemented in both multimodal and text-only versions, employing a scaffolded self-play approach. Commercial models significantly outperformed open-weight models, with the primary performance gap attributed to superior deep captioning capabilities in commercial systems. The evaluation reveals that while multimodal models can handle goal-oriented dialogue with appropriate scaffolding, open-weight models still struggle with complex visual scenes and abstract spatial reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors created three structured dialogue games to evaluate multimodal language models: a reference resolution game using images of crowds, an alignment-through-dialogue game, and a map navigation game. Each game was implemented in both multimodal and text-only versions. A scaffolded self-play framework was used where models generated dialogues in alternating turns. The evaluation employed a 0-100 scoring scale across different task types, measuring capabilities in reference resolution, dialogue alignment, and spatial navigation. The framework tested both commercial models (Claude-3.5, GPT-4o) and open-weight models (InternVL2, Idefics) to compare performance differences.

## Key Results
- Commercial models achieved 80+ points while open models scored ~30-40 on 0-100 scale
- Performance gaps primarily driven by deep captioning superiority in commercial models
- Commercial models demonstrated robust spatial reasoning in navigation tasks
- Open models showed limited graph reasoning and frequent looping errors in complex visual scenes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The evaluation framework works by creating controlled, structured dialogue scenarios that isolate specific multimodal capabilities. The scaffolded self-play approach allows systematic testing of reference resolution (identifying objects in complex scenes), dialogue alignment (achieving mutual understanding through conversation), and spatial reasoning (navigating abstract maps). By implementing both multimodal and text-only versions, the framework can attribute performance differences specifically to visual understanding rather than language capabilities alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal grounding**: The ability to connect visual and textual information is essential for understanding real-world scenes and references. Quick check: Can the model identify objects in complex crowd scenes?
- **Spatial reasoning**: Understanding relationships between objects and navigating abstract spaces is critical for tasks like map navigation. Quick check: Does the model avoid looping errors in navigation tasks?
- **Graph reasoning**: Processing structured information and relationships is necessary for understanding abstract representations. Quick check: Can the model handle graph-based navigation tasks?
- **Deep captioning**: Generating detailed, accurate descriptions of visual content drives performance in reference tasks. Quick check: Does the model provide comprehensive scene descriptions?
- **Conversational alignment**: The ability to achieve mutual understanding through dialogue is fundamental to collaborative tasks. Quick check: Can the model successfully align with its partner through iterative dialogue?
- **Scaffolded interaction**: Structured guidance helps models perform complex tasks that might be too challenging in fully open-ended scenarios. Quick check: Does scaffolding improve task completion rates?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Multimodal Input -> Visual Processing -> Deep Captioning -> Language Understanding -> Dialogue Generation -> Output

**Critical Path**: Visual Processing → Deep Captioning → Reference Resolution (most performance-sensitive pathway)

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study reveals a fundamental tradeoff between specialized visual processing (favoring commercial models) and general-purpose multimodal integration (where open models lag). Commercial models prioritize deep captioning and visual-text alignment, while open models struggle with the same capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Open models exhibit looping errors in navigation, inability to process complex crowd scenes, and failure to maintain spatial consistency. Commercial models show fewer failures but may over-rely on captioning rather than true visual understanding.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test commercial models with visual processing disabled to isolate captioning contributions
2. Evaluate open models on simplified visual scenes to establish baseline capabilities
3. Compare performance on text-only vs. multimodal versions to quantify visual contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Controlled environment may not generalize to real-world unstructured dialogue scenarios
- Evaluation framework's reliance on deep captioning may overestimate true visual understanding
- Scaffolded self-play provides structured guidance that wouldn't exist in natural interactions
- Performance gaps may reflect training data differences rather than fundamental architectural limitations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Commercial models demonstrate superior performance in multimodal tasks compared to open-weight models, particularly in reference resolution and map navigation tasks. The systematic performance gap (80+ vs. 30-40 points) is well-supported by experimental data.
- **Medium Confidence**: Deep captioning capabilities in commercial models are the primary driver of performance differences. While significant, the study doesn't fully isolate captioning from other contributing factors.
- **Low Confidence**: Open-weight models' limitations in abstract representations and graph reasoning are definitively established. Evidence shows clear performance gaps, but causal mechanisms remain unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Uncontrolled Environment Testing**: Conduct the same evaluation in naturalistic dialogue scenarios without scaffolding to determine if performance gaps persist when models must handle ambiguity and context shifts without structured guidance.

2. **Architectural Ablation Studies**: Systematically disable or modify specific capabilities (captioning, spatial reasoning modules, graph processing) in commercial models to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance, particularly in reference resolution tasks.

3. **Cross-Modal Transfer Validation**: Test whether models trained on text-only versions of the games can successfully transfer to multimodal versions, and vice versa, to determine if models are genuinely integrating modalities or simply processing them in parallel.
