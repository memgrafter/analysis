core_contribution: This paper introduces the optimal observability problem (OOP) for

# What should be observed for optimal reward in POMDPs?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.10768
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10768
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: The optimal observability problem (OOP) is undecidable in general but becomes decidable for positional strategies; an SMT-backed algorithm outperforms brute-force enumeration in benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the optimal observability problem (OOP) in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), focusing on selecting sensors cost-effectively to achieve desired goals within a fixed budget. The authors show that OOP is undecidable in general by reduction from the policy-existence problem for POMDPs, but becomes decidable when restricted to positional strategies. They present two algorithms for decidable variants: one based on optimal strategies of the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) and one using parameter synthesis with SMT. Experimental results using Z3 and PRISM on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that the SMT-backed approach outperforms brute-force enumeration, particularly for deterministic strategies. The paper also introduces a typed extension of parametric Markov chains to model the observability problem, showing that POP and SSP are decidable in ETR and PSPACE respectively.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize the optimal observability problem (OOP) and prove its undecidability by reduction from the policy-existence problem for POMDPs. They show that OOP becomes decidable when restricted to positional strategies. Two algorithms are proposed: one leveraging optimal strategies of the underlying MDP, and another using parameter synthesis with SMT. The SMT-backed algorithm is implemented and tested on standard POMDP benchmarks using Z3 and PRISM, demonstrating superior performance over brute-force enumeration. Additionally, a typed extension of parametric Markov chains is introduced to model the observability problem, with decidability results for POP and SSP established in ETR and PSPACE respectively.

## Key Results
- OOP is undecidable in general by reduction from POMDP policy existence.
- OOP is decidable for positional strategies using a parameterized Markov chain framework.
- The SMT-backed algorithm outperforms brute-force enumeration on standard POMDP benchmarks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's core mechanism is the reduction of OOP to known hard problems in POMDPs and parametric Markov chains. By leveraging the undecidability of policy existence in POMDPs, the authors establish the undecidability of OOP. For decidable variants, they use parameterized Markov chains to model the observability problem, enabling the application of parameter synthesis techniques. The SMT-backed algorithm efficiently explores the space of possible sensor configurations, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of brute-force enumeration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**: A framework for decision-making under uncertainty where the agent does not have full observability of the state.
  - *Why needed*: POMDPs model the core problem of optimal sensor selection under partial observability.
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the POMDP model captures the essential features of the environment and the agent's sensing capabilities.

- **Parametric Markov Chains**: A probabilistic model where certain transition probabilities are left as parameters, allowing for analysis and synthesis of parameter values satisfying desired properties.
  - *Why needed*: Parametric Markov chains provide a formal framework to model and solve the observability problem.
  - *Quick check*: Ensure that the parameterized model accurately represents the sensor selection and its impact on observability.

- **Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)**: A decision problem for logical formulas with respect to combinations of background theories.
  - *Why needed*: SMT solvers like Z3 are used to efficiently explore the space of possible sensor configurations.
  - *Quick check*: Validate that the SMT encoding correctly captures the constraints and objectives of the observability problem.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: POMDP model -> Parameterized Markov chain -> SMT solver (Z3) -> Optimal sensor configuration

**Critical path**: The critical path involves constructing the parameterized Markov chain from the POMDP model, encoding the observability constraints and objectives into SMT, and using the SMT solver to find the optimal sensor configuration.

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice between positional and general strategies affects the decidability of OOP. Positional strategies are decidable but may not capture all optimal solutions. The SMT-backed approach trades off computational efficiency for solution quality.

**Failure signatures**: Failure to find a feasible solution may indicate that the budget is too low or the observability requirements are too strict. Incorrect results may arise from errors in the POMDP model or the SMT encoding.

**First experiments**:
1. Run the SMT-backed algorithm on a small POMDP benchmark with a known optimal solution to validate correctness.
2. Compare the performance of the SMT-backed algorithm against brute-force enumeration on a set of POMDP benchmarks with varying sizes and complexities.
3. Test the parameterized Markov chain extension with different reward structures to assess its flexibility and applicability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly mentioned in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The undecidability result for OOP relies on the reduction from policy-existence in POMDPs, but the exact complexity bounds and the generality of the reduction remain unclear.
- The decidability claims for positional strategies and the typed PMC extension are well-supported by the reduction framework, but practical scalability beyond benchmark POMDPs is uncertain.
- The experimental evaluation focuses on relatively small POMDP benchmarks, and performance on larger, real-world problems is unknown.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Decidability of OOP for positional strategies; correctness of the reduction framework; experimental validation of the SMT-backed algorithm outperforming brute-force enumeration.
- **Medium confidence**: The practicality of the SMT-based approach on larger POMDPs; the effectiveness of the typed PMC extension for complex reward structures.
- **Low confidence**: General scalability of the proposed algorithms; applicability to non-standard POMDP reward structures.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the SMT-backed algorithm on larger, real-world POMDP benchmarks to assess practical scalability.
2. Test the parameterized Markov chain extension with diverse reward specifications beyond the current benchmarks.
3. Investigate alternative reductions or algorithmic strategies to tighten the complexity bounds for OOP variants.
