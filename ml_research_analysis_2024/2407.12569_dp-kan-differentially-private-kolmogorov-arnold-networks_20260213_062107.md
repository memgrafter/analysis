# DP-KAN: Differentially Private Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.12569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12569
- Reference count: 23
- KANs show comparable performance to MLPs in both non-private and differentially private settings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with differentially private training using DP-SGD. The authors demonstrate that KANs can be trained with differential privacy in a straightforward manner while maintaining comparable performance to traditional MLPs. The study evaluates KANs on tabular regression datasets and MNIST classification, showing that KANs experience less accuracy degradation under privacy constraints compared to MLPs, making them a promising alternative for privacy-preserving machine learning applications.

## Method Summary
The paper combines KANs with DP-SGD for differentially private training. KANs use learnable univariate functions parameterized as B-splines with residual activations, replacing fixed activation functions in traditional neural networks. The models are trained using backpropagation compatible with standard optimization techniques including DP-SGD with Adam optimizer. The study compares KAN performance against MLPs on tabular regression datasets (Synthetic, California, Diamonds, Traffic, NBA, Garbage, MLB) and MNIST classification, measuring R² scores and test accuracy under both private and non-private settings.

## Key Results
- KANs achieve comparable accuracy to MLPs in non-private settings on both regression and classification tasks
- Under differential privacy constraints, KANs experience less accuracy degradation than MLPs on tabular regression datasets
- For MNIST classification, KANs achieve higher accuracy than MLPs for similar parameter counts while maintaining better privacy-accuracy trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KANs maintain model performance under differential privacy similar to MLPs
- Mechanism: KANs use learnable univariate functions with B-splines and residual activations, providing flexibility comparable to MLPs while being trainable with standard DP-SGD
- Core assumption: The learnable activation functions in KANs provide sufficient representational power to maintain accuracy under privacy constraints
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KAN can be made private in a straightforward manner" and "experiences similar deterioration due to privacy constraints"
  - [section]: "KANs use residual activation functions, combining a basis function b(x) with the B-spline" and are "compatible with standard optimization techniques such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD)"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - neighboring papers focus on KAN training dynamics but don't specifically address differential privacy performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KANs achieve comparable accuracy to MLPs in non-private settings
- Mechanism: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem allows KANs to decompose multivariate functions into sums of univariate functions, potentially offering more efficient representation
- Core assumption: The theoretical foundation of KANs translates to practical performance gains over MLPs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the accuracy of KAN is not only comparable with MLP"
  - [section]: "KANs replace fixed activation functions with learnable univariate functions parameterized as B-splines. This enhances flexibility and interpretability compared to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - neighboring papers compare KAN vs MLP but don't provide conclusive evidence of consistent superiority

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DP-SGD can be directly applied to KAN training without architectural modifications
- Mechanism: KANs use backpropagation compatible with standard optimization techniques, allowing straightforward integration of differential privacy mechanisms
- Core assumption: The computational graph of KANs supports gradient computation and clipping in the same way as standard neural networks
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KAN can be made private in a straightforward manner"
  - [section]: "KANs are trained using backpropagation, compatible with standard optimization techniques such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD)"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence - neighboring papers don't discuss DP-SGD compatibility

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differential Privacy fundamentals (ε, δ parameters, adjacent datasets)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how privacy guarantees translate to model performance degradation
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for two datasets to be "adjacent" in differential privacy?

- Concept: B-spline basis functions and their role in function approximation
  - Why needed here: KANs rely on B-splines as building blocks for learnable univariate functions
  - Quick check question: How do B-splines differ from traditional fixed activation functions like ReLU?

- Concept: Backpropagation through learnable activation functions
  - Why needed here: KANs have learnable activations, requiring understanding of gradient flow through these components
  - Quick check question: What additional terms appear in the gradient computation when activations are learnable parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Learnable univariate functions (B-splines + residual activation) → Summation → Output
- Critical path: Forward pass through KAN layers → Loss computation → Backward pass through learnable activations → Parameter updates with DP-SGD
- Design tradeoffs: KANs offer interpretability and potential efficiency but may have higher computational cost per parameter compared to MLPs. The trade-off between B-spline resolution (grid size) and model capacity is crucial
- Failure signatures: Poor performance under DP may indicate insufficient B-spline resolution or suboptimal residual activation parameters. Training instability could suggest gradient clipping issues with the learnable components
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a simple KAN on a synthetic dataset with known functional form to verify correct implementation of learnable activations
  2. Compare KAN vs MLP on a small tabular dataset without privacy to establish baseline performance parity
  3. Apply DP-SGD to both KAN and MLP on the same dataset to measure relative performance degradation under privacy constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, several important questions remain unresolved based on the study's scope and limitations, including whether KANs maintain their privacy-accuracy advantage on larger, more complex datasets; how different KAN architectural choices impact differential privacy performance; and the computational efficiency trade-offs of DP-trained KANs compared to DP-trained MLPs for larger models.

## Limitations

- The study is limited to relatively small datasets and may not generalize to larger, more complex problems
- Specific B-spline parameterization details are not fully specified, affecting reproducibility
- Computational overhead comparisons between KANs and MLPs under DP constraints are not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

- High confidence: KANs can be trained with DP-SGD in a straightforward manner without architectural modifications
- Medium confidence: KANs maintain comparable performance to MLPs in non-private settings and under privacy constraints
- Low confidence: KANs will consistently outperform MLPs across all dataset types and privacy budgets

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments across diverse dataset families (including highly linear and highly nonlinear relationships) to verify KAN's consistent performance advantage over MLPs under DP constraints
2. Perform ablation studies varying B-spline grid resolution and residual activation parameters to identify optimal configurations for DP training
3. Measure and compare computational efficiency (training time, memory usage) between KAN and MLP implementations under identical DP settings to quantify the practical trade-offs
