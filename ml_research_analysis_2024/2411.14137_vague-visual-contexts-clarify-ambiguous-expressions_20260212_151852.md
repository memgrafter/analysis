# VAGUE: Visual Contexts Clarify Ambiguous Expressions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14137
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14137
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multimodal models struggle with intent disambiguation requiring visual context

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VAGUE, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal AI systems' ability to integrate visual context for intent disambiguation. VAGUE consists of 1.6K ambiguous textual expressions paired with images and multiple-choice interpretations, where the correct answer is only apparent with visual context. The dataset spans both staged (VCR) and natural (Ego4D) scenes. Experiments reveal that existing multimodal models struggle to infer the speaker's true intent, with accuracy remaining significantly below human performance. Analysis shows models often fail to distinguish true intent from superficial visual correlations, indicating they perceive images but do not effectively reason with them.

## Method Summary
The VAGUE benchmark is constructed by collecting ambiguous textual expressions from two sources: staged scenes from the VCR dataset and natural scenes from Ego4D. For each textual expression, multiple-choice interpretations are created where the correct answer requires visual context to disambiguate. The dataset contains 1.6K examples with human annotations validating the ambiguity and correctness of interpretations. Models are evaluated on their ability to select the correct interpretation given the text and image, with human performance serving as a baseline.

## Key Results
- Multimodal models perform significantly below human accuracy on intent disambiguation tasks requiring visual context
- Models often fail to distinguish true intent from superficial visual correlations in images
- Performance gaps persist across both staged (VCR) and natural (Ego4D) scene types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VAGUE works by creating controlled ambiguity in textual expressions that can only be resolved through visual context. The benchmark isolates the multimodal reasoning capability by ensuring that textual information alone is insufficient for correct interpretation, forcing models to effectively integrate and reason with visual information.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal integration** - Why needed: Essential for understanding how models combine text and image information. Quick check: Can the model correctly identify which visual elements are relevant to the ambiguous text?

**Intent disambiguation** - Why needed: Core task of understanding speaker meaning beyond literal text. Quick check: Does the model select interpretations that match human intuitions about intended meaning?

**Visual reasoning** - Why needed: Required to extract relevant information from images beyond surface-level features. Quick check: Can the model identify causal relationships between visual elements and textual ambiguity?

**Ambiguity perception** - Why needed: Understanding what constitutes ambiguity and how humans resolve it. Quick check: Do human annotators consistently agree on which interpretations are correct?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Text encoder -> Image encoder -> Fusion module -> Reasoning layer -> Classification layer

**Critical path:** The fusion module is critical as it determines how visual and textual information are combined for reasoning about intent.

**Design tradeoffs:** The benchmark must balance between creating genuinely ambiguous expressions and ensuring visual context provides clear disambiguation signals.

**Failure signatures:** Models tend to rely on superficial visual correlations rather than understanding the relationship between visual context and speaker intent.

**First experiments:**
1. Test human performance on the same examples to establish baseline
2. Evaluate unimodal text-only models to confirm visual context is necessary
3. Test multiple multimodal models to identify common failure patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 1.6K examples may limit generalizability across diverse scenarios
- Subjective nature of ambiguity perception could affect annotation consistency
- Limited error analysis showing specific patterns of model reasoning failures
- Potential overlap between staged and natural scene types may affect result interpretation

## Confidence
- Dataset construction methodology: Medium
- Experimental results showing model limitations: High
- Analysis of superficial visual correlation versus true reasoning: Medium
- Claims about architectural limitations: Low to Medium

## Next Checks
1. Expand the dataset with additional examples across more diverse scene types to test generalizability beyond the current VCR and Ego4D domains
2. Conduct more detailed error analysis on model failures to identify specific patterns in reasoning breakdowns, distinguishing between cases where models fail to attend to relevant visual information versus misinterpreting the relationship between text and image
3. Test whether fine-tuning multimodal models specifically on VAGUE examples improves performance, which would help determine whether current failures stem from architectural limitations or insufficient training on this type of reasoning task
