# Learning Structure and Knowledge Aware Representation with Large Language Models for Concept Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12442
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12442
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms existing methods in concept recommendation accuracy while ensuring recommendations align better with human knowledge structure

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recommending the next learning concept in online education by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced textual descriptions of concepts. The framework, SKarREC, integrates semantic meanings and structural relationships between concepts by incorporating knowledge graph information into LLM prompts for ambiguity resolution. A graph-based adapter trained via contrastive learning transforms anisotropic text embeddings into smooth, structure-aware representations suitable for recommendation. The method combines knowledge tracing predictions with these enhanced concept representations to provide personalized recommendations that consider both learner proficiency and concept relationships.

## Method Summary
The SKarREC framework consists of four main components: concept interpretation using LLM with knowledge graph context, a graph-based adapter (GCN with contrastive learning) for embedding transformation, knowledge tracing (DKT + GRU) for learner state prediction, and a transformer-based recommendation model. The method pre-processes datasets to construct concept-answer pairs and transition graphs, generates enhanced concept text using LLM (GPT-3.5) with knowledge graph context, and trains the model through pre-training on contrastive learning, knowledge tracing, and sequence modeling tasks, followed by fine-tuning with cross-entropy loss for next concept prediction.

## Key Results
- SKarREC outperforms existing methods in concept recommendation accuracy across multiple datasets
- The framework ensures recommendations align better with human knowledge structure compared to baseline approaches
- The method effectively integrates semantic meanings and structural relationships between concepts, improving recommendation performance and knowledge usage efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The graph-based adapter trained via contrastive learning on the knowledge graph transforms anisotropic text embeddings into smooth, structure-aware representations that improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: The adapter uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to aggregate information from neighboring concepts in the knowledge graph. Through contrastive learning with edge dropout, it learns to map text embeddings into a space where structurally similar concepts (based on prerequisite relationships) are closer together.
- **Core assumption**: The knowledge graph provides meaningful structural relationships that should be reflected in the embedding space for better concept recommendation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "we propose a graph-based adapter to adapt anisotropic text embeddings to the concept recommendation task. This adapter is pre-trained through contrastive learning on the knowledge graph to get a smooth and structure-aware concept representation."
  - [section]: "GNN's learning mechanism can result in smoother embeddings [15], potentially resolving the problem of anisotropy in text embedding distributions."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citations about contrastive learning on knowledge graphs for text adaptation found.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Structure and knowledge-aware concept interpretation resolves ambiguity in concept explanations by incorporating predecessor and successor information from the knowledge graph into LLM prompts.
- **Mechanism**: When generating concept explanations, the LLM is provided with context about neighboring concepts in the knowledge graph. This constrains the explanation generation to be contextually appropriate for the educational domain rather than using general interpretations.
- **Core assumption**: Concept meanings vary by context, and the knowledge graph provides the correct contextual boundaries for interpretation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "we leverage factual knowledge from LLMs as well as the precedence and succession relationships between concepts obtained from the knowledge graph to construct textual representations of concepts."
  - [section]: "we refine our prompts to the LLM by including the concept's predecessor and successor nodes of the concept from the knowledge graph. This method helps the LLM to deliver an explanation tailored to the specific educational context."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citations about using knowledge graph context for LLM prompt engineering found.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Combining knowledge tracing predictions with structure-aware concept representations enables personalized recommendations that consider both learner proficiency and concept relationships.
- **Mechanism**: The framework concatenates knowledge state embeddings (from knowledge tracing) with graph-adapted concept embeddings as input to a transformer-based recommendation model. This dual representation allows the model to recommend concepts based on both what the learner knows and the conceptual dependencies.
- **Core assumption**: Effective concept recommendation requires both individual learner modeling and understanding of concept relationships.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "This approach effectively integrates semantic meanings and structural relationships between concepts, improving recommendation performance and knowledge usage efficiency."
  - [section]: "Personalized concept recommendation should not only align with the human knowledge system but also be based on the individual learner's knowledge state."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus about combining knowledge tracing with LLM-generated concept representations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive learning with graph data**
  - Why needed here: Used to train the graph-based adapter to create structure-aware embeddings by pulling similar concepts (based on graph structure) closer in embedding space.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of edge dropout in the contrastive learning process for the graph-based adapter?

- **Concept: Knowledge tracing in educational recommendation**
  - Why needed here: Provides the learner's current proficiency state, which is essential for personalized concept recommendations.
  - Quick check question: How does the knowledge tracing module update the learner's knowledge state over time?

- **Concept: Transformer-based sequential recommendation**
  - Why needed here: Processes the sequence of learning interactions to predict the next concept, incorporating both temporal patterns and the enhanced concept representations.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using self-attention in the transformer blocks for this recommendation task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Concept Interpretation Module -> Graph-based Adapter -> Knowledge Tracing Module -> Recommendation Model -> Next concept prediction
- **Critical path**: Learner sequence → Knowledge tracing → Concept interpretation → Graph-based adapter → Transformer recommendation → Next concept prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using LLM for concept interpretation provides rich semantic information but adds latency and dependency on external API
  - GCN-based adapter is more effective than MLP but requires maintaining and updating the knowledge graph
  - Combining knowledge tracing with structural information improves personalization but increases model complexity
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor recommendation accuracy when knowledge graph contains noisy or incorrect edges
  - Degraded performance if LLM explanations are too generic or context-inappropriate
  - Model instability if knowledge tracing predictions are inaccurate or sequence lengths vary widely
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test the graph-based adapter in isolation: Replace with simple MLP adapter and measure performance drop to quantify adapter contribution
  2. Test knowledge graph quality impact: Remove edges randomly at different rates and observe recommendation degradation
  3. Test concept interpretation necessity: Remove LLM explanations and use only concept names, measure impact on accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of SKarRec compare to human expert-designed concept recommendation systems in terms of educational outcomes and learner satisfaction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on comparing SKarRec to other algorithmic approaches but does not include human expert systems as a baseline.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate SKarRec against human-designed systems, leaving the question of whether AI-based approaches can match or exceed human expertise unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison study between SKarRec and human expert-designed concept recommendation systems, measuring both objective learning outcomes (e.g., concept mastery) and subjective learner satisfaction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is SKarRec's performance to the quality and completeness of the underlying knowledge graph?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that SKarRec uses knowledge graphs to resolve concept ambiguity and improve recommendations, but does not extensively analyze the impact of graph quality on performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experiments varying the quality or completeness of the knowledge graph to quantify its impact on SKarRec's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments manipulating the quality and completeness of the knowledge graph (e.g., adding/removing edges, introducing noise) and measuring the corresponding changes in SKarRec's recommendation accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can SKarRec be effectively adapted to recommend concepts in domains outside of traditional STEM subjects, such as humanities or arts education?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on concept recommendation in educational settings but does not specify the subject domains of the datasets used or explore cross-domain applicability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss or test SKarRec's performance in non-STEM domains, leaving its generalizability to other educational areas unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying SKarRec to concept recommendation tasks in humanities, arts, or other non-STEM subjects and evaluating its performance compared to domain-specific baselines.

## Limitations

- The quality of knowledge graph edges significantly impacts both the LLM's concept interpretation and the graph-based adapter's contrastive learning, yet the paper doesn't thoroughly examine how graph noise affects recommendation performance.
- The dependency on LLM-generated concept descriptions introduces potential latency and consistency issues in real-world deployment.
- While the framework claims to integrate semantic and structural information effectively, the relative contribution of each component to the final performance remains unclear without ablation studies that isolate these effects.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of using knowledge graphs for concept interpretation and the general architecture of combining knowledge tracing with structure-aware representations are well-supported by the experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of the graph-based adapter and contrastive learning mechanism, as the paper lacks sufficient detail on hyperparameters and training procedures for exact reproduction.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the framework's ability to ensure recommendations "align better with the human knowledge structure" are primarily based on performance metrics rather than direct human evaluation or curriculum alignment studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Graph Quality Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically evaluate how varying levels of knowledge graph noise (removing edges randomly at different rates) impacts recommendation accuracy to quantify the framework's robustness to structural uncertainty.

2. **Component Isolation Experiments**: Conduct controlled experiments that progressively remove components (LLM explanations, graph-based adapter, knowledge tracing) to precisely measure each component's contribution to the final performance.

3. **Longitudinal Performance Study**: Track recommendation accuracy and learner progress over extended periods to validate whether the framework consistently maintains knowledge usage efficiency and prevents knowledge gaps, as claimed in the paper.
