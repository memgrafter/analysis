# Learning to Forget: Bayesian Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.19727
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19727
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: RS3GP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art diffusion models while offering significantly faster training times

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes (RS3GP), a Bayesian time series forecasting method that addresses the challenge of capturing local information in long sequences while maintaining computational efficiency. The key innovation is Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF), which introduce a forgetting mechanism to signature features by incorporating exponential decay factors that allow the model to dynamically focus on recent information. Experimental results demonstrate that RS3GP outperforms other GP-based alternatives and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art deep learning diffusion models while offering significantly faster training times.

## Method Summary
The method combines signature features with random Fourier features and variational inference to create a scalable Bayesian time series forecasting model. RFDSF introduces exponential decay factors into signature computation, allowing the model to focus on recent information while maintaining global structure. The model uses variational inference to learn optimal frequency and phase distributions, enabling probabilistic forecasting through a single-pass recurrent computation. The framework processes sequences of length 10^4 steps in approximately 10^-2 seconds using less than 1GB of GPU memory.

## Key Results
- Outperforms other GP-based alternatives on eight univariate time series datasets
- Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art deep learning diffusion models
- Processes sequences of length 10^4 steps in approximately 10^-2 seconds using less than 1GB of GPU memory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- RFDSF introduces a principled forgetting mechanism by multiplying increments with exponential decay factors that depend on both time step and signature level
- Each increment in the signature computation is multiplied by λ^(l-ip) where λ is a channel-wise decay factor and l-ip is the time difference, creating exponential decay over time steps
- Core assumption: The exponential decay form is appropriate for most time series forgetting patterns
- Break condition: When time series require non-exponential forgetting patterns or when long-term dependencies are more important than recent information

### Mechanism 2
- The variational treatment of random parameters allows the model to learn optimal frequency and phase distributions while maintaining computational efficiency
- By placing factorized variational distributions over frequencies Ω and phases B, the model learns posterior distributions through KL divergence minimization rather than fixed random sampling
- Core assumption: Factorized variational distributions are sufficient to capture the necessary correlations for good performance
- Break condition: When complex correlations between random parameters are needed for optimal performance

### Mechanism 3
- The recurrent structure with parallelizable scan operation enables sublinear time computation while maintaining accuracy
- The RFDSF recursion can be computed using a parallelizable scan operation that processes sequences in O((M+W)LD+M LDd) time complexity
- Core assumption: Parallelizable scan operations can be efficiently implemented on GPUs
- Break condition: When GPU parallelization is not available or when sequences are too short to benefit from parallel computation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signature features and their computation via Chen's relation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how signatures provide structured global descriptions of time series is fundamental to grasping why forgetting is necessary
  - Quick check question: What is the recursive formula for computing the m-th signature level Sm(x) of a path x?

- Concept: Random Fourier Features and their application to kernel approximation
  - Why needed here: RFDSF builds on RFF by adding decay factors to the signature feature computation
  - Quick check question: How does Bochner's theorem allow stationary kernels to be approximated using random Fourier features?

- Concept: Gaussian Process variational inference and the evidence lower bound (ELBO)
  - Why needed here: VRS3GP uses variational inference to learn the posterior distributions over random parameters
  - Quick check question: What are the components of the ELBO in a variational GP model with random Fourier features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input time series → RFDSF features → Variational parameters → Linear layer → Predictive distribution
- Critical path: Time series → RFDSF features → Variational parameters → Linear layer → Predictive distribution
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed decay vs learned decay: Fixed is simpler but learned can adapt to data
  - Factorized vs correlated variational distributions: Factorized is computationally efficient but may miss correlations
  - Full batch vs minibatch training: Full batch uses all data but minibatch is more scalable

- Failure signatures:
  - Underfitting: Poor fit to training data, high latent function variance penalty
  - Overfitting: Excellent training fit but poor generalization, low latent function variance
  - Convergence issues: High variance in ELBO, unstable training with resampling
  - Memory issues: Large sequences exceeding GPU memory, especially with high signature truncation levels

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test RFDSF with fixed decay factors on synthetic multi-sinusoidal data to verify forgetting behavior
  2. Compare VRS3GP vs RS3GP on small datasets to validate variational learning benefits
  3. Scale up to long sequences (L ~ 10^4) to verify sublinear computation time claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas require further investigation based on the methodology and results presented.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence comparing wall-clock times across different sequence lengths and hardware configurations
- Factorized variational distributions may not capture complex correlations needed for optimal performance
- Direct comparison with diffusion models on identical hardware and sequence lengths is not provided

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core mathematical framework for RFDSF and its recursive computation is well-defined and verifiable through the signature feature properties
- Medium confidence: The variational inference implementation and learning dynamics, as these depend on specific hyperparameter choices and initialization schemes not fully detailed
- Low confidence: The computational efficiency claims relative to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, as these require extensive benchmarking across different hardware configurations

## Next Checks

1. **Computational Complexity Verification**: Implement timing benchmarks for RFDSF feature computation across sequence lengths from 10^2 to 10^4 steps, comparing wall-clock times with and without GPU parallelization on multiple hardware setups.

2. **Forgetting Mechanism Ablation**: Create controlled experiments with synthetic data where the optimal forgetting pattern is known (e.g., exponentially decaying signals vs. non-decaying patterns) to validate whether RFDSF correctly adapts its decay parameters.

3. **Variational vs Fixed Parameter Comparison**: Conduct head-to-head comparisons of RS3GP (with variational learning) versus VRS3GP (with fixed random parameters) on multiple datasets, measuring both predictive performance and training stability to quantify the benefit of the variational approach.
