# Synthesizing Audio from Silent Video using Sequence to Sequence Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.17608
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17608
- Reference count: 1
- Primary result: Proposed method encodes video frames using 3D VQ-VAE and decodes to audio, but full audio generation not achieved due to time/resource constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to generate audio from silent video using a sequence-to-sequence modeling framework. The method employs a 3D Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode video frames into discrete embeddings, which are then decoded into audio waveforms using a fully connected neural network. The model is trained on the "Airplane" class of the Youtube8M dataset, focusing on videos with similar sounds and minimal background noise. While the VQ-VAE successfully creates discrete representations of video frames, the final audio generation results were not achievable within the project's scope. The authors suggest future improvements including expanding the model's domain, utilizing multiple GPUs for faster training, and automating hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a 3D VQ-VAE to encode video frames into discrete embeddings, which are then decoded into audio waveforms using a fully connected neural network. The model is trained on the "Airplane" class of the Youtube8M dataset, focusing on videos with similar sounds and minimal background noise. The VQ-VAE encoder successfully creates discrete representations of video frames, which can be reconstructed to resemble the original frames. However, the final audio generation results were not achievable within the project's scope due to limitations in time and resources.

## Key Results
- 3D VQ-VAE successfully encodes video frames into discrete embeddings
- Video frame reconstruction from embeddings shows reasonable quality
- Full audio generation from silent video not achieved due to time/resource constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VQ-VAE discretizes video frames into a compact latent space that can be decoded into audio
- Mechanism: 3D convolutional encoder maps video into embeddings → Vector Quantizer selects nearest codebook vectors → decoder reconstructs video or generates audio from these discrete codes
- Core assumption: Visual patterns in a specific domain (e.g., airplane videos) correlate strongly enough with consistent audio patterns for the decoder to learn the mapping
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach employs a 3D Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to capture the video's spatial and temporal structures, decoding with a custom audio decoder for a broader range of sounds."
  - [section] "The 3D Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) comprises two repetitions of the 3D convolutional and ReLU layers before feeding into a Vector Quantizer. The VQ-VAE is used due to its speed and efficiency in training in comparison to a simple Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for decoding"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus neighbors focus on video-to-audio but not VQ-VAE specifically
- Break condition: If visual-to-audio correlation weakens (e.g., videos with inconsistent background noise), the decoder cannot generalize

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fully connected decoder transforms flattened video embeddings into normalized audio waveforms
- Mechanism: Flattened discrete embeddings → linear layers with non-linear activations → Tanh normalization → audio waveform output
- Core assumption: The flattened embedding space preserves enough sequential and semantic information for the decoder to reconstruct plausible audio
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The decoder is a series of fully connected linear layers with non-linear activations to transform the flattened encoded video input into an audio waveform... a final Tanh activation function is used as the normalization function as it has been utilized in prior research with signal processing and reconstruction"
  - [abstract] "decoding with a custom audio decoder for a broader range of sounds"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus neighbors do not describe fully connected decoder architectures
- Break condition: If embedding dimensionality is too low, decoder cannot reconstruct detailed audio

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training MSE loss aligns generated audio with ground truth, enabling supervised learning of visual-to-audio mapping
- Mechanism: During training, decoder output is compared to actual audio segment via Mean Squared Error → gradients flow back to update decoder weights only (encoder fixed for inference)
- Core assumption: Audio segments are temporally aligned with video frames so that MSE provides meaningful supervision
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "From this the mean square error is calculated using the original sound and then perform gradient descent throughout the layers to adjust the weights and improve the output sound"
  - [abstract] "Trained on the Youtube8M dataset segment, focusing on specific domains"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus neighbors do not specify MSE training approach
- Break condition: If audio-video alignment is poor, MSE becomes meaningless and training fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector Quantization (VQ)
  - Why needed here: Compresses high-dimensional video embeddings into discrete codebook entries, enabling efficient representation and stable training
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the commitment loss in VQ-VAE training?
- Concept: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: Processes spatiotemporal video data (height × width × time) rather than treating frames independently
  - Quick check question: How does a 3D conv layer differ from stacking 2D convs on individual frames?
- Concept: Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling
  - Why needed here: Learns mapping from variable-length video sequences to corresponding audio sequences, not just frame-by-frame prediction
  - Quick check question: Why can't a simple frame-by-frame CNN+WaveNet pipeline handle diverse audio as well as an end-to-end seq2seq model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video → 3D VQ-VAE → Discrete embeddings → Flatten → Fully connected decoder → Audio
- Critical path: Video → 3D VQ-VAE → Discrete embeddings → Flatten → Fully connected decoder → Audio
- Design tradeoffs:
  - VQ-VAE vs. plain VAE: Faster training and avoids posterior collapse, but discretization may lose fine detail
  - Fully connected decoder vs. recurrent/transformer: Simpler and faster, but may not capture long-range dependencies as well
  - Fixed 10-second segments: Easier batching and alignment, but limits maximum video length
- Failure signatures:
  - Audio sounds like noise → embedding space too coarse or decoder underfit
  - Generated audio silent or constant tone → decoder stuck in local minimum, learning rate too low
  - Poor reconstruction of video frames → encoder not learning useful features
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train VQ-VAE alone on video frames; verify reconstruction quality on held-out frames
  2. Freeze VQ-VAE, train decoder to reconstruct input audio from random noise (sanity check)
  3. Train full end-to-end model on airplane videos; evaluate audio quality with both MSE and human listening

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the 3D VQ-VAE model successfully generate high-quality audio from silent video, or are there inherent limitations in the architecture that prevent this?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "final audio generation results were not achievable within the project's scope due to limitations in time and resources."
- Why unresolved: The model was not fully trained and evaluated for audio generation, only the video encoding portion was demonstrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Complete training of the model with multiple GPUs and sufficient time, followed by quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the generated audio quality compared to ground truth.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would expanding the model's training domain beyond just airplane videos significantly improve its ability to generalize to diverse video content and generate appropriate sounds?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "The best improvement for useability would be to train the model on a larger domain of videos other than just videos of planes."
- Why unresolved: The model was only trained on the limited "Airplane" class of the Youtube8M dataset, restricting its ability to generalize.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating the model on a diverse dataset covering multiple object classes and sound types, then measuring its performance on unseen video content.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would utilizing multiple GPUs with Horovod and automated hyperparameter tuning significantly accelerate training and improve the model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose future directions including "splitting the training to multiple GPUs via Horovod" and "utilizing an automated hyperparameter tuning process."
- Why unresolved: The model was only trained on a single T4 GPU with manual hyperparameter tuning, which was time-consuming and potentially suboptimal.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing distributed training with Horovod and automated hyperparameter tuning, then comparing the training time and model performance against the single GPU baseline.

## Limitations
- The full end-to-end system was not successfully demonstrated - only video encoding portion was shown
- Critical architectural details like embedding dimensions and codebook size are unspecified
- Training was limited to a single GPU and manual hyperparameter tuning, potentially suboptimal

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The VQ-VAE can encode video frames into discrete embeddings and reconstruct those frames reasonably well. This is directly demonstrated in the results.
- **Medium confidence**: The general approach of using video embeddings to condition audio generation is sound, as supported by related work in the corpus. However, success depends heavily on implementation details not specified in the paper.
- **Low confidence**: The specific claim that this particular VQ-VAE + fully connected decoder architecture will produce high-quality audio from silent video. Without empirical results demonstrating this, the claim remains theoretical.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline sanity check**: Train a simple autoencoder on video frames alone and verify it can reconstruct frames accurately. This validates the VQ-VAE implementation before attempting the full pipeline.

2. **Decoder capability test**: With the VQ-VAE frozen, train the fully connected decoder to generate audio from random noise or from audio embeddings. This isolates whether the decoder architecture can produce plausible audio at all.

3. **Controlled domain experiment**: Train the full system on a narrow domain (e.g., single speaker videos with consistent background) where visual-audio correlation is strongest. Compare generated audio quality using both objective metrics (MSE) and subjective listening tests to establish baseline performance.
