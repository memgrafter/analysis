# To Ask or Not to Ask? Detecting Absence of Information in Vision and Language Navigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05831
- Authors: Savitha Sam Abraham; Sourav Garg; Feras Dayoub
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Proposed attention-based instruction-vagueness estimation improves precision-recall balance by 52% and enhances SPL/NE metrics when integrated with VLN models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN): enabling agents to recognize when they lack sufficient information to proceed due to vague or high-level instructions. The authors propose an attention-based instruction-vagueness (IV) estimation module that learns associations between instructions and the agent's trajectory using multi-head attention. By leveraging instruction-to-path alignment information during training, the module significantly improves the agent's ability to detect uncertainty points and request timely assistance, reducing potential navigation digressions.

## Method Summary
The method introduces an attention-based IV estimation module that takes encoded instructions and path information as input, uses multi-head attention to learn instruction-to-path alignment, and outputs uncertainty scores through a binary classifier. The module can be integrated with any VLN model and uses pseudo-labels based on either ground truth paths or instruction-path alignment for training. A pre-training task identifies relevant instruction spans for predicting the agent's next move, with the learned knowledge transferred to the IV module through weight initialization. The system improves precision-recall balance by 52% and enhances navigation performance when integrated with DUET and HAMT models.

## Key Results
- Precision-recall balance improves by 52% through instruction-to-path alignment learning
- Attention scores from instruction-to-path attention network serve as better indicators for vagueness estimation
- Significant improvements in SPL and NE metrics when integrated with DUET and HAMT models
- Pseudo-labels based on instruction-path alignment provide better precision-recall balance than ground truth path-based labels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The instruction-vagueness estimation module improves precision-recall balance by 52% through instruction-to-path alignment learning.
- Mechanism: The module uses multi-head attention to learn associations between the instruction and the agent's trajectory, creating an enhanced representation that captures alignment between the two. This representation is then used to classify uncertainty in the agent's next move prediction.
- Core assumption: The alignment between instruction and path is a reliable indicator of vagueness in the agent's understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By leveraging instruction-to-path alignment information during training, the module's vagueness estimation performance improves by around 52% in terms of precision-recall balance."
  - [section]: "We propose an attention-based instruction-vagueness (IV) estimation module that learns associations between instructions and the agent's trajectory."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers but none specifically addressing instruction-vagueness estimation with attention-based approaches.
- Break condition: If the instruction-to-path alignment does not correlate with actual uncertainty in the agent's predictions, the module's performance will degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-training the multi-head attention network on instruction-to-path alignment improves the IV module's performance.
- Mechanism: The pre-training task identifies relevant instruction spans for predicting the agent's next move. This knowledge is transferred to the IV module through weight initialization, providing a better starting point for learning vagueness estimation.
- Core assumption: Instruction-to-path alignment knowledge is transferable to vagueness estimation tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "By incorporating this instruction to path alignment information into the Instruction-Vagueness (IV) module, we significantly improve its ability to detect points of uncertainty."
  - [section]: "We demonstrate that having an MHA network trained on the instruction-to-path alignment task can help enhance its performance in the estimation of instruction vagueness."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence in corpus - no papers found specifically on pre-training attention networks for VLN vagueness estimation.
- Break condition: If the pre-training task does not capture relevant patterns that transfer to vagueness estimation, the performance improvement will be minimal or negative.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The IV module provides timely assistance by requesting oracle intervention when uncertainty is detected, improving SPL and NE metrics.
- Mechanism: When the IV module predicts high uncertainty, it overrides the navigator's prediction and requests the oracle's optimal move. This prevents the agent from following incorrect paths due to vague instructions.
- Core assumption: Oracle interventions at uncertainty points lead to better navigation outcomes than allowing the agent to proceed with uncertain predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Equipping agents with this ability enhances efficiency by reducing potential digressions and seeking timely assistance."
  - [section]: "Predicting 'uncertain' prompts the agent to seek help, opting for guidance from the oracle rather than following its original predicted move."
  - [corpus]: No corpus evidence found for oracle intervention strategies in VLN.
- Break condition: If oracle interventions occur too frequently (high recall) or not frequently enough (high precision), the overall navigation performance may suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic VLN setup, including how agents navigate using instructions and how cross-modal attention works, is essential for implementing the IV module.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the factionPredictor in a VLN model uses instruction and node representations to predict the next move?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and multi-head attention
  - Why needed here: The IV module relies heavily on multi-head attention to learn instruction-to-path alignment, so understanding how attention works is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of using multiple attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism?

- Concept: Binary classification and loss functions
  - Why needed here: The IV module performs binary classification to determine uncertainty, requiring understanding of BCE loss and how it works.
  - Quick check question: How does binary cross-entropy loss differ from categorical cross-entropy loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Instruction encoding → Multi-head attention (instruction-to-path alignment) → Binary classifier → Uncertainty output → Oracle intervention decision

- Critical path: The instruction encoding flows through the multi-head attention layer to capture alignment with the path, then through the binary classifier to produce uncertainty predictions that trigger oracle interventions when needed.

- Design tradeoffs: The module must balance between being overly cautious (high recall) and overly confident (high precision). Using instruction-to-path alignment labels vs ground truth path labels affects this balance. Pre-training vs random initialization of attention weights is another tradeoff.

- Failure signatures: If the IV module is too sensitive, it will request help too often, reducing agent autonomy. If too conservative, it won't catch uncertainty points, leading to navigation failures. Poor instruction-to-path alignment learning will result in inaccurate uncertainty detection.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Integrate IV module with DUET and HAMT without pre-training to establish baseline performance
  2. Pseudo-label comparison: Train IV module with labelGP vs labelIP to evaluate which provides better precision-recall balance
  3. Pre-training impact: Compare IV module performance with pre-trained MHA weights vs random initialization to measure transfer learning benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed instruction-to-path attention-based approach compare to ensemble-based methods for uncertainty estimation in VLN tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that ensemble-based approaches like conformal prediction are not efficient for VLN due to the complexity of the task, but it does not provide a direct comparison.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results comparing the proposed method with ensemble-based approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the proposed method with ensemble-based approaches in terms of precision-recall balance, SPL, and NE metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed instruction vagueness estimation module be effectively integrated with other VLN models beyond DUET and HAMT?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the IV module can be integrated into any VLN model with components as shown in Figure 2, but only evaluates it with DUET and HAMT.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results with other VLN models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the IV module when integrated with other VLN models, such as Speaker-Follower or Vision-and-Dialog Navigation models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method vary with different levels of instruction vagueness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the ULN dataset includes high-level and fine-grained instructions, but it does not analyze the performance of the proposed method across different levels of vagueness.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance across varying levels of instruction vagueness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the method's performance on a dataset with varying levels of instruction vagueness, such as instructions with different levels of detail or instructions with intentional ambiguities.

## Limitations

- The method relies on pseudo-labels for training, which may not perfectly capture true uncertainty points in navigation
- Performance improvements are measured relative to existing methods and may not generalize across different VLN environments
- The system's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the uncertainty detection mechanism and oracle interventions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The architectural design of the IV module using multi-head attention for instruction-to-path alignment is technically sound and well-supported by attention mechanism literature.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that instruction-to-path alignment knowledge transfers effectively to vagueness estimation requires more empirical validation, as transfer learning outcomes can be unpredictable.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that oracle interventions improve SPL and NE metrics is supported by results but depends heavily on the quality of the uncertainty detection mechanism.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate the IV module on diverse instruction types (Isort vs Iorig) and environments beyond the R2R dataset to verify robustness across different vagueness scenarios.

2. **Oracle Dependency Analysis**: Measure the frequency of oracle interventions and their impact on overall navigation autonomy to ensure the system doesn't become overly dependent on external guidance.

3. **Cross-Model Transferability**: Test the IV module's performance when integrated with VLN models beyond DUET and HAMT to assess its adaptability to different navigator architectures.
