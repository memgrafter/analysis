# A Survey on Extractive Knowledge Graph Summarization: Applications, Approaches, Evaluation, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.12001
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12001
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Key outcome**: Systematic survey of extractive KG summarization methods, categorizing approaches into static (intrinsic KG characteristics) and dynamic (user-customized) summaries, with discussion of evaluation and future directions.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of extractive knowledge graph (KG) summarization methods, which aim to distill compact subgraphs from large KGs to facilitate downstream tasks. The authors categorize existing approaches into two main types: static summaries that capture intrinsic KG characteristics (e.g., data patterns or query answers) and dynamic summaries that are customized to user needs (e.g., keyword queries or personal interests). The survey covers applications, methodologies, evaluation metrics, and identifies several promising future research directions.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on extractive KG summarization by categorizing methods into static and dynamic approaches. Static summarization methods focus on pattern coverage (class/property instantiations, characteristic sets, entity description patterns, link patterns, and path patterns) or answer coverage (leveraging graph structure and query logs). Dynamic summarization methods address query-biased summarization using formulations like Maximum Coverage, Group Steiner Trees, Diameter-Bounded Max-Coverage Group Steiner Trees, and Quadratic Group Steiner Trees, as well as personalized summarization tailored to single entities, domains, or query histories. The survey also discusses evaluation methods and highlights challenges in assessing KG summaries.

## Key Results
- Extractive KG summarization methods are categorized into static (context-independent) and dynamic (user-customized) approaches
- Static methods focus on pattern coverage (classes, properties, characteristic sets, EDPs, LPs, path patterns) and answer coverage using graph structure and query logs
- Dynamic methods use combinatorial optimization formulations (Maximum Coverage, GST, Diameter-Bounded GST, QGST) and personalized approaches
- Future research directions include neural extraction, supervised extraction, generative extraction, comparative extraction, and collaborative extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Static KG summaries are more efficient for query optimization than full KGs because they preserve essential statistical features while reducing size.
- Mechanism: By extracting representative patterns (e.g., characteristic sets, EDPs, LPs) and sampling based on node centrality, summaries retain enough structural and distributional information for accurate cardinality estimation in federated queries.
- Core assumption: Query performance bottlenecks stem primarily from large dataset size and join cardinality estimation, not from complete data fidelity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "An extractive KG summary can be regarded as a view of a given KG and queried in the same manner [Fan et al., 2014; Wang, 2017; Li et al., 2016]. A common application of such views is federated KG query optimization [Montoya et al., 2017] where multiple KGs are jointly queried, and the performance relies on the efficiency of the query plan, e.g., the estimation of join cardinalities for sub-queries. Extractive KG summaries have been used to compute accurate estimations of this kind using less time than the complete statistics derived from the original large KGs [Heling and Acosta, 2023]."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations or examples in corpus neighbors; relevance to summarization is indirect.
- Break condition: If downstream tasks require exact answers or rare patterns, the summary’s coverage loss will degrade performance beyond acceptable thresholds.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamic KG summaries tailored to user needs improve relevance and usability in KG search and exploration.
- Mechanism: Formulations like Maximum Coverage, Group Steiner Trees, and Diameter-Bounded Max-Coverage Group Steiner Trees select query-relevant subgraphs that balance coverage, compactness, and structural cohesiveness, enabling faster user comprehension and more precise results.
- Core assumption: User satisfaction in KG search/exploration is driven more by the relevance and coherence of presented information than by completeness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Dynamic summaries are customized and are extracted to satisfy each user’s individual information needs, e.g., to show the relevance of a KG to a user’s query, or to tailor the content of a KG to users’ specific interests."
  - [section] "Early methods in this category solve it as a node/edge ranking problem. Recently, various formulations in combinatorial optimization have been adopted, in particular based on Group Steiner Trees for reflecting connections among query keywords in the graph structure."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus neighbors discuss general text summarization, not KG-specific techniques.
- Break condition: If query patterns are highly unpredictable or long-tail, precomputation and fixed formulations may fail to capture nuanced user intent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Extractive KG summarization fills a unique niche by producing subgraphs directly processable by machines, unlike schema-level or grouping-based summaries.
- Mechanism: Extractive methods select actual entities and relations from the KG, preserving both human readability and machine-processability, which enables direct reuse in downstream AI systems.
- Core assumption: The primary bottleneck in KG-based AI systems is the size and complexity of the KG, not the representational format.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This type of KG summary, a.k.a. KG snippet, faithfully exemplifies the content of the original KG, and can be effortlessly comprehended by humans and directly processed by machines in the same manner as the original KG."
  - [section] "Extractive KG summarization has attracted considerable research attention from interdisciplinary areas related to AI and big data, and has been used in KG profiling [Ellefi et al., 2018], query optimization [Heling and Acosta, 2023], search [Chapman et al., 2020], exploration [Lissandrini et al., 2022], and many other KG-driven applications."
  - [corpus] Weak: Corpus focuses on text summarization, not graph/KG-specific summarization.
- Break condition: If KG-based tasks require schema-level abstractions or high-level patterns, extractive summaries may lack necessary expressiveness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph (KG) data model and schema
  - Why needed here: Understanding entities, types, properties, and relations is foundational to grasping summarization techniques and their objectives.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between an entity’s type and a property in a KG?

- Concept: Graph algorithms and centrality measures
  - Why needed here: Summarization methods rely heavily on graph traversal, node ranking, and coverage optimization, all of which depend on graph theory fundamentals.
  - Quick check question: How does PageRank differ from indegree/outdegree centrality in KG summarization?

- Concept: Combinatorial optimization and NP-hardness
  - Why needed here: Many summarization formulations (e.g., Group Steiner Tree, Maximum Coverage) are NP-hard, so understanding approximation algorithms is crucial for implementation.
  - Quick check question: Why is the Group Steiner Tree problem NP-hard, and what does a greedy approximation algorithm achieve?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Ingestion: Load and parse RDF/SPARQL KG data
  - Pattern Extraction: Identify and represent class/property instantiations, EDPs, LPs, path patterns
  - Query Processing: Map user queries to subgraph extraction formulations
  - Optimization Engine: Solve Maximum Coverage, GST, QGST, or Diameter-Bounded problems
  - Evaluation Module: Compute coverage, cohesiveness, and task-specific metrics
  - Output Formatter: Serialize summary as subgraph or snippet

- Critical path:
  1. Ingest KG → 2. Extract patterns/centrality → 3. Process user query → 4. Formulate optimization problem → 5. Solve (approximate if needed) → 6. Evaluate and output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Coverage vs. compactness: Higher coverage increases size and may reduce usability
  - Accuracy vs. speed: Exact optimization is intractable for large KGs; approximations trade quality for responsiveness
  - Static vs. dynamic: Static summaries are reusable but less tailored; dynamic summaries are more relevant but require per-query computation

- Failure signatures:
  - Summaries too large: Coverage metrics dominate; compactness not enforced
  - Summaries disconnected: Optimization formulation ignores connectivity constraints
  - Poor relevance: Query mapping or weighting scheme misaligned with user intent
  - Slow extraction: No precomputed indexes or inefficient algorithms for large-scale KGs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract static summary using Maximum Coverage on a small KG; measure coverage of classes/properties and runtime.
  2. Implement Group Steiner Tree for keyword query; compare compactness and relevance vs. Maximum Coverage.
  3. Evaluate static vs. dynamic summaries on a query log; measure precision/recall for downstream task performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can neural extraction methods, such as graph neural networks, be effectively applied to extractive KG summarization to improve performance and scalability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights neural extraction as an underexplored future direction, noting that existing methods mainly exploit symbolic features of KGs (e.g., ontological schema, graph structure), while there is room for exploring neural methods, particularly graph neural networks, given the rapid advances in deep learning models in recent years.
- Why unresolved: Neural methods for KG summarization are still in their infancy, and it remains unclear how to best leverage these techniques to capture the complex relationships and patterns in KGs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of neural extraction methods against traditional approaches on various KG summarization tasks, as well as investigations into the scalability and interpretability of these methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can supervised extraction methods be developed and applied to extractive KG summarization, considering the potential inadequacy of labeled data for training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies supervised extraction as an underexplored area, noting that while unsupervised extraction has become mainstream in KG summarization, supervised methods deserve consideration. It suggests that the inadequacy of labeled data for training could be addressed by semi-supervised learning techniques such as self-training and co-training.
- Why unresolved: Developing effective supervised extraction methods for KG summarization requires addressing the challenge of obtaining sufficient labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of successful supervised extraction methods for KG summarization, along with evaluations of their performance compared to unsupervised approaches, and investigations into the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning techniques in addressing the labeled data challenge.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can extractive KG summarization methods be adapted to handle the evolution of KGs over time, ensuring that summaries remain up-to-date and relevant?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that some methods rely on precomputed distance indices, which need to be rebuilt when the KG evolves. It also highlights the importance of evaluating the time required for extracting summaries, especially for real-time applications like KG search engines.
- Why unresolved: KGs are often dynamic and evolve over time, which poses a challenge for extractive summarization methods that assume a static KG. Adapting these methods to handle KG evolution while maintaining summary quality and efficiency is an open problem.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigations into incremental or streaming summarization techniques that can efficiently update summaries as the KG evolves, along with evaluations of their performance in terms of summary quality, update time, and resource usage.

## Limitations

- The survey lacks direct empirical validation of claimed benefits, particularly for dynamic summaries' impact on user satisfaction and static summaries' efficiency gains in query optimization
- Evidence for many claims relies on indirect citations or logical inference rather than experimental results from the surveyed methods themselves
- The unique niche claim for extractive methods over schema-level summaries is well-argued conceptually but lacks real-world adoption evidence

## Confidence

- **Medium**: Claims about static summaries improving query optimization efficiency - evidence is indirect and primarily based on recent work rather than broad empirical validation
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of dynamic summaries for improving user satisfaction - strong theoretical motivation but lacks direct experimental validation in the survey
- **High**: Conceptual distinction between extractive and schema-level summaries - well-argued but relies on logical inference from method descriptions
- **Low**: Real-world adoption evidence for extractive methods' unique benefits - logical inference but limited empirical support

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce a static summarization method (e.g., 3-S)** on a benchmark KG and measure both coverage and task performance (e.g., query optimization speedup) to validate the efficiency claim.
2. **Implement a dynamic summarization method (e.g., KSD)** and run a user study or task-based evaluation to empirically confirm improvements in relevance and usability.
3. **Compare extractive vs. schema-level summaries** on a representative KG-driven application (e.g., profiling or exploration) to assess the practical benefits of machine-processable subgraphs.
