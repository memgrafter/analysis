# Retrieve, Summarize, Plan: Advancing Multi-hop Question Answering with an Iterative Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13101

- Improves F1 score by 4.1 on HotpotQA and 4.4 on 2WikiMultihopQA compared to state-of-the-art

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-hop question answering using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods with large language models (LLMs). The authors identify two main issues with existing iterative RAG methods: context overload from multiple retrieval rounds and redundant or over-planning due to lack of recorded retrieval trajectory. To solve these problems, they propose ReSP (Retrieve, Summarize, Plan), which uses a dual-function summarizer that compresses information from retrieved documents while maintaining separate global evidence memory and local pathway memory queues. Experimental results show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating excellent robustness to context length variations.

## Method Summary
ReSP is an iterative RAG method that incorporates a dual-function summarizer to address context overload and planning redundancy in multi-hop question answering. The method maintains two separate memory queues: global evidence memory for the overarching question and local pathway memory for tracking retrieval progress. The dual-function summarizer generates targeted summaries for both the overarching question and current sub-question simultaneously, compressing retrieved documents into relevant information. The reasoner uses these memory queues to decide when to stop iterating, preventing over-planning and repetitive planning. The method is tested on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets using Llama3-8B-instruct as the base model and E5-base-v2 as the retriever.

## Key Results
- Achieves 4.1 F1 score improvement on HotpotQA compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Achieves 4.4 F1 score improvement on 2WikiMultihopQA compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates excellent robustness to context length variations, maintaining performance as input size increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The dual-function summarizer reduces context overload by compressing retrieved documents while maintaining two separate memory queues. It generates two types of summaries simultaneously - one targeting the overarching question (global evidence memory) and another targeting the current sub-question (local pathway memory). This compression maintains only relevant information for each context while preserving sufficient reasoning capacity.

### Mechanism 2
Maintaining global and local memory queues prevents over-planning and repetitive planning. The global evidence memory tracks progress toward answering the overarching question, while the local pathway memory records which sub-questions have already been retrieved. The reasoner uses both queues to decide when to stop iterating, enabling better planning decisions than implicit reasoning alone.

### Mechanism 3
Query-focused summarization in iterative RAG enables more effective information compression than traditional methods. Unlike standard RAG that uses all retrieved documents as context, this approach compresses information into targeted summaries that directly address specific aspects of the question, reducing noise and improving reasoning efficiency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Understanding how RAG works is fundamental to grasping why iterative approaches and summarization are necessary for multi-hop question answering.
  - Quick check: What are the two main components of a standard RAG system and how do they interact?

- **Multi-hop reasoning**: The paper specifically addresses multi-hop question answering, which requires understanding how information must be integrated across multiple steps.
  - Quick check: What distinguishes a multi-hop question from a single-hop question in terms of information requirements?

- **Query-focused summarization**: This technique is the key innovation that enables the method to handle context overload and prevent repetitive planning.
  - Quick check: How does query-focused summarization differ from generic document summarization in terms of objectives and output?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Question → Retriever → Summarizer → Memory Queues → Reasoner → (repeat or Generator)
- **Critical path**: Question → Retriever → Summarizer → Memory Queues → Reasoner → (repeat or Generator)
- **Design tradeoffs**: More iterations improve accuracy but increase computational cost; more aggressive summarization reduces context but risks losing important information; separate memory queues prevent planning issues but require careful synchronization
- **Failure signatures**: Context overload (performance degrades as iteration count increases), over-planning (continues iterating despite sufficient information), repetitive planning (generates same sub-questions multiple times), summarization failure (summaries miss critical information needed for reasoning)
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Compare ReSP performance against standard RAG with varying context lengths to verify context overload mitigation
  2. Measure iteration counts between ReSP and baseline iterative RAG methods to validate planning efficiency improvements
  3. Test different base model sizes for each module to determine optimal resource allocation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the dual-function summarizer's performance change when applied to multi-hop question answering tasks with more than three hops? The paper mentions that the method is tested with a maximum of three iterations, following the construction of the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Conducting experiments with datasets containing questions requiring more than three hops would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of using different base models for the reasoner, summarizer, and generator modules on the overall performance of ReSP? While the paper provides insights into the impact of base model size on each module, it does not explore the potential benefits or drawbacks of using different base models for each module simultaneously.

### Open Question 3
How does ReSP handle cases where the retrieved documents are sparse or do not contain relevant information for the sub-questions? The paper mentions that ReSP can adjust the retrieval subject and craft new sub-questions if previous retrievals do not yield relevant information, but it does not provide detailed insights into how the method handles such scenarios.

## Limitations
- Performance may not generalize to domains beyond Wikipedia-based datasets due to reliance on specific document structures
- Method's effectiveness with different model sizes or architectures remains unexplored, limiting scalability understanding
- Evaluation focuses primarily on F1 scores without comprehensive metrics for reasoning path quality or edge case handling

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 - Dual-function summarizer effectiveness**: Medium
- **Mechanism 2 - Memory queue benefits**: Medium  
- **Mechanism 3 - Query-focused summarization advantages**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing ReSP with alternative summarization strategies to isolate the contribution of the dual-function design to overall performance improvements
2. Implement detailed logging of iteration counts, sub-question diversity, and planning path analysis to quantify reductions in over-planning and repetitive planning compared to baseline iterative RAG methods
3. Evaluate ReSP on multi-hop QA datasets from different domains (biomedical literature, legal documents, news articles) to assess generalization beyond Wikipedia-based datasets and adaptation to different information structures
