# Importance of realism in procedurally-generated synthetic images for deep learning: case studies in maize and canola

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.05128
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05128
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Synthetic images improve neural network performance in plant phenotyping, with realism being crucial for accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of procedurally-generated synthetic images for training deep learning models in plant phenotyping, focusing on maize and canola. L-systems are used to generate realistic plant simulations with known annotations to augment or replace real images for training neural networks. The research explores how realism in synthetic images affects prediction accuracy and uses neural network predictions to refine L-system models, creating a feedback loop. Results show that synthetic images improve prediction accuracy, especially when real images are scarce. Realism in synthetic images significantly enhances performance, with canola showing sensitivity to model calibration. Synthetic images alone can perform well, reducing the need for ground truth labeling.

## Method Summary
The study uses L-systems to generate synthetic plant images with known annotations, which are then used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant phenotyping tasks. The CNNs are trained using the Deep Plant Phenomics platform on real images of maize and canola from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln dataset, as well as synthetic images generated from L-system models. The performance is evaluated using mean absolute loss, standard deviation, and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r2) between predicted and actual phenotypic traits. The study explores different combinations of real and synthetic images for training and tests on real images to assess the impact of realism in synthetic images on prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Synthetic images improve prediction accuracy, especially when real images are scarce.
- Realism in synthetic images significantly enhances performance, with canola showing sensitivity to model calibration.
- Synthetic images alone can perform well, reducing the need for ground truth labeling.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic images improve neural network performance when real images are scarce.
- Mechanism: L-systems generate synthetic plant images with known annotations, reducing labeling costs. When real training data is limited, synthetic images fill the gap, providing additional varied examples.
- Core assumption: Synthetic images are realistic enough for the network to generalize to real images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that synthetic images improve prediction accuracy, especially when real images are scarce."
  - [section] "We found that augmenting with synthetic images was always beneficial, and it was especially so if there were fewer real images..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus focuses on medical imaging, not plant phenotyping.
- Break condition: If synthetic images are not realistic enough, the network will not generalize to real images, leading to poor performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Realism in synthetic images significantly enhances performance.
- Mechanism: More realistic synthetic images better match the distribution of real images, leading to improved network performance.
- Core assumption: The L-system parameters can be adjusted to create increasingly realistic synthetic images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Realism in synthetic images significantly enhances performance, with canola showing sensitivity to model calibration."
  - [section] "Small changes in L-systems can improve the synthetic images remarkably."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus focuses on medical imaging, not plant phenotyping.
- Break condition: If the L-system cannot be adjusted to create realistic images, or if the realism improvements do not translate to better network performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neural network predictions can be used to refine L-system models, creating a feedback loop.
- Mechanism: Network predictions on real images provide feedback on the realism of synthetic images. This feedback is used to adjust L-system parameters, creating more realistic synthetic images, which in turn improve network performance.
- Core assumption: The L-system parameters can be adjusted based on network predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we see how neural network predictions can be used to help calibrate L-systems themselves, creating a feedback loop."
  - [section] "The ANN prediction results were used to help improve the L-system calibration process, which were in-turn used to create even more accurate L-systems and synthetic images."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus focuses on medical imaging, not plant phenotyping.
- Break condition: If the L-system parameters cannot be adjusted based on network predictions, or if the feedback loop does not lead to improved realism or network performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: L-systems -> CNNs -> Calibration -> L-systems (feedback loop)
- Critical path: L-systems generate synthetic images → CNNs analyze plant images → Calibration adjusts L-system parameters → Improved synthetic images for better CNN performance
- Design tradeoffs: Realism vs. computational cost in generating synthetic images; network complexity vs. training data availability.
- Failure signatures: Poor network performance on real images despite good performance on synthetic images; unrealistic synthetic images; lack of improvement in network performance despite L-system refinement.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a CNN on real maize images only and evaluate performance.
  2. Train a CNN on synthetic maize images only and evaluate performance on real images.
  3. Train a CNN on a combination of real and synthetic maize images and evaluate performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The exact L-system parameters and generation details for synthetic images are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- The study focuses on only two plant species (maize and canola), limiting generalizability to other crops
- No quantitative metric for "realism" is provided, making it difficult to objectively measure improvements in synthetic image quality

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general finding that synthetic images improve performance when real data is scarce
- Medium confidence: The claim that realism in synthetic images significantly impacts performance, as this depends heavily on the specific L-system implementation
- Medium confidence: The feedback loop mechanism between neural networks and L-systems, as implementation details are limited

## Next Checks
1. Verify the L-system parameter adjustment process by conducting a controlled experiment varying parameters systematically and measuring impact on prediction accuracy
2. Test the approach on a third crop species not included in the original study to assess generalizability
3. Implement quantitative realism metrics (e.g., structural similarity index) to objectively measure synthetic-real image similarity
