# Information for Conversation Generation: Proposals Utilising Knowledge Graphs

- This paper proposes three methods to improve LLM-based conversational generation using knowledge graphs, including dynamic embeddings, emotional features, and narrative bubbles.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes three knowledge graph-based methods to enhance LLM conversational generation: dynamic knowledge graph embeddings with recommendation for real-time information integration, emotional value features (valence, arousal, dominance) for emotional alignment, and narrative bubbles for character consistency. The approaches aim to address content gaps, hallucinations, and lack of emotional or character coherence in LLM responses. Each method leverages knowledge graph structures to provide contextually relevant information to LLMs during conversation generation.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three complementary methods for improving LLM-based conversational generation. The first method uses dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that can incorporate new information without full retraining, combined with a recommendation system for selecting relevant knowledge. The second method stores emotional values (valence, arousal, dominance) as features in knowledge graph entities to improve emotional alignment with user input. The third method structures character information from novels into narrative bubbles within a knowledge graph, organizing episodic information to maintain character consistency across conversations.

## Key Results
- Dynamic knowledge graph embeddings with recommendation can integrate new information without full retraining
- Storing emotional values as entity features may provide better emotional alignment with user input
- Narrative bubbles can organize character information to maintain consistency in generated responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embeddings (DKGE) with recommendation enable integration of new information without full retraining, reducing LLM content gaps and hallucinations.
- Mechanism: New triples are added to the KG, and entity embeddings are updated via averaging related embeddings. A recommender predicts relevant-to links between user utterances and background entities for real-time retrieval.
- Core assumption: KGEs can be updated incrementally by aggregating neighbor embeddings and that a link prediction model can handle cold-start utterance entities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dynamic knowledge graph embeddings and recommendation could allow for the integration of new information and the selection of relevant knowledge"
  - [section] "DKGEs are KGEs which are able to add new data into the embeddings without requiring retraining of the entire graph"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus anchor found; evidence comes only from cited papers (Bordes et al. 2013, Cui et al. 2023).
- Break condition: If the averaging strategy fails to preserve semantic structure or link prediction accuracy degrades for unseen entities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Storing emotional values (valence, arousal, dominance) as features in KG entities improves emotional alignment of LLM responses with user input.
- Mechanism: User input and KG entities are annotated with VAD scores. A recommender selects entities whose VAD scores are closer to the input's emotional state, biasing retrieved information toward emotionally consistent responses.
- Core assumption: VAD scores provide a continuous emotional space that correlates with perceived emotional quality in generated text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "storing entities with emotional values as additional features may provide knowledge that is better emotionally aligned with the user input"
  - [section] "Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) scores are commonly used to denote emotions as a point in space"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus anchor found; evidence is theoretical and from prior emotion modeling work.
- Break condition: If VAD scores are poorly estimated or do not map meaningfully to conversational tone, the recommendation will not improve emotional alignment.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Narrative bubbles organize character information from novels into episodic memory-like structures, enabling consistent character portrayal and natural dialogue.
- Mechanism: Each bubble captures a temporal/spatial episode with utterances, facts, and a summary. Relations between entities (shared_bubble, grounded_by, relevant_to) encode episode context and link to external KG. Summaries drive recommendation via link prediction to user input.
- Core assumption: Episodic memory structures in KG mirror human narrative processing and that relation patterns between bubbles can be learned without full retraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrating character information through narrative bubbles would maintain character consistency"
  - [section] "novel could be structured into narrative 'bubbles' within a KG for a particular character... delineating between utterances, character facts, and providing summaries"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus anchor found; concept borrowed from Tulving's episodic memory theory (Tulving 1972, 2002) and narrative processing literature.
- Break condition: If bubble granularity is too coarse/fine or summary entities fail to capture episode semantics, link prediction and character consistency will degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs)
  - Why needed here: KGEs enable semantic similarity and relation prediction between entities, essential for the recommender and dynamic updates.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between translational distance models (e.g., TransE) and semantic matching models (e.g., DistMult) in KGEs?

- Concept: Episodic Memory and Narrative Structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding episodic memory informs the bubble design, ensuring character experience is organized by temporal/spatial episodes.
  - Quick check question: How does Tulving's definition of episodic memory (what, when, where) map to the bubble entity structure?

- Concept: Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) Emotional Space
  - Why needed here: VAD provides a continuous 3D representation of emotion for entity features and user input comparison.
  - Quick check question: Given a sentence with high arousal and positive valence, what VAD values would you expect for a related KG entity to be considered "emotionally aligned"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  KG Store -> KGE Engine -> Recommender -> LLM Interface
  (with VAD Annotator and Bubble Manager as optional modules)

- Critical path: User input → Recommender → KG context → LLM generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity of narrative bubbles: finer granularity increases episode specificity but risks sparsity.
  - VAD feature quality: richer annotation improves alignment but increases annotation cost.
  - Embedding update frequency: frequent updates keep knowledge fresh but increase compute.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low recommendation precision → link prediction model underfits.
  - Inconsistent character responses → bubble segmentation fails to preserve episode semantics.
  - Emotional mismatch → VAD values poorly calibrated or not correlated with input tone.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Build a small KG with a few bubbles from a novel excerpt; test link prediction between utterance and bubble entities.
  2. Annotate entities with synthetic VAD scores; implement a simple nearest-neighbor recommender and measure emotional alignment via human evaluation.
  3. Integrate the recommender with a simple LLM prompt template; measure hallucination reduction on factual QA tasks with dynamic KG updates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The proposed methods rely heavily on theoretical foundations and cited prior work rather than empirical validation within the paper itself.
- The effectiveness of VAD-based emotional alignment depends heavily on annotation quality and the correlation between VAD space and conversational tone.
- The narrative bubble implementation details are underspecified, particularly regarding how bubble segmentation boundaries are determined.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The conceptual framework connecting knowledge graphs to LLM conversation generation is well-established in the literature.
- Medium Confidence: The mechanisms described are theoretically sound but lack experimental validation.
- Low Confidence: The narrative bubble implementation details are underspecified and the claim that this structure will maintain character consistency across diverse conversational scenarios remains unproven.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the averaging-based KGE update mechanism on a small knowledge graph with known semantic relationships. Measure how well link prediction performance is preserved after incremental updates compared to full retraining.

2. Create a test corpus with manually annotated VAD scores and conversational responses. Compare response quality and emotional alignment when using VAD-based recommendation versus random or frequency-based retrieval, using human evaluation metrics.

3. Build a minimal implementation using a short novel excerpt, creating narrative bubbles with the proposed structure. Test whether the bubble organization enables consistent character responses by having the system answer questions about different characters across multiple conversation turns.
