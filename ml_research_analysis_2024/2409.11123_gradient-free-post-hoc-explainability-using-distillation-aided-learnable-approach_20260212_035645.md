# Gradient-free Post-hoc Explainability Using Distillation Aided Learnable Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.11123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11123
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes a gradient-free post-hoc explainability method called Distillation Aided eXplainability (DAX) that significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of IoU, deletion AUC, and human evaluations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating explanations for complex AI models in a post-hoc, gradient-free manner. The authors propose a novel approach called Distillation Aided eXplainability (DAX), which uses a mask generation network and a student network to generate saliency-based explanations. The method is evaluated on both image and audio tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, deletion area under the curve (AUC), and subjective human evaluations.

## Method Summary
DAX uses a two-component architecture: a mask generation network that identifies salient regions of the input, and a student network that approximates the local behavior of the black-box model. The method operates directly on the raw input space rather than reduced segments, using joint optimization with L1 regularization and KL divergence loss to prevent trivial solutions. The framework is trained using perturbed input samples and black-box outputs without requiring gradient access to the black-box model.

## Key Results
- Significantly outperforms existing approaches in IoU metric and deletion AUC
- Demonstrates improved performance across diverse tasks (image and audio)
- Shows better subjective human evaluation scores compared to baseline methods
- Operates effectively on raw input space (O(104)) without dimensionality reduction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The mask generation network and student network jointly approximate the local behavior of the black-box model, enabling gradient-free explainability.
- Mechanism: The student network locally approximates the black-box using perturbed inputs, while the mask generation network learns which input regions are salient. This joint optimization avoids the need for gradient access to the black-box.
- Core assumption: The local neighborhood of an input can be approximated by a non-linear function that is learnable from perturbed samples and black-box outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The mask generation network learns to generate the multiplier mask that finds the salient regions of the input, while the student distillation network aims to approximate the local behavior of the black-box model."
  - [section]: "The mask generation network learns to generate the multiplier mask that finds the salient regions of the input, while the student network tries to locally distill the black-box."
- Break condition: If the local behavior of the black-box is too complex or non-smooth, the student network may fail to approximate it accurately, leading to poor explanations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: L1 regularization and KL divergence loss prevent trivial solutions and ensure meaningful explanations.
- Mechanism: The L1 penalty encourages sparsity in the mask, while KL divergence aligns the distribution of student outputs with black-box outputs, preventing the identity solution.
- Core assumption: The combination of L1 and KL divergence loss terms is sufficient to regularize the optimization and avoid trivial or degenerate explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Optimizing based on Equation (8) can be ill-posed, as it can lead to the trivial identity solution fM (xp; θM ) = I. It can be avoided by using a regularized loss. We propose an L1 loss, as discussed in Equation (10) given below."
  - [section]: "The KL-divergence loss helps in bringing the distributions of DAX scores closer to the black-box scores, which regularizes the MSE loss."
- Break condition: If the regularization weights (λ1, λ2) are not properly tuned, the optimization may still converge to trivial or uninformative explanations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Operating directly on the raw input space (O(104)) rather than reduced segments (O(101)) provides more precise and reliable explanations.
- Mechanism: By working directly on the pixel level, DAX avoids the potential errors and imprecision introduced by segment-based methods like LIME.
- Core assumption: The raw input space contains sufficient information to generate meaningful explanations without the need for dimensionality reduction through segmentation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "LIME segments the input image, and uses the segment locations as the input variables without working on the pixels. This leads to a drastic reduction in the input dimensionality of O(101)."
  - [section]: "In the proposed DAX framework, the explanations are obtained at the pixel level, making them very precise."
- Break condition: If the input dimensionality is too high, the optimization may become computationally intractable or prone to overfitting.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Local linear approximation vs. non-linear approximation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the limitations of linear approximation methods like LIME and the benefits of non-linear approximation used in DAX.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper argue that local linear approximation can be unreliable for explaining complex black-box models?

- Concept: Gradient-free vs. gradient-based explainability methods
  - Why needed here: Grasping the difference between methods that require gradient access to the black-box and those that only need input-output access, like DAX.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of gradient-free methods over gradient-based methods in terms of accessibility and robustness?

- Concept: Distillation for model approximation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how distillation is used in DAX to locally approximate the black-box model without gradient access.
  - Quick check question: How does the student network in DAX approximate the local behavior of the black-box, and why is this necessary for gradient-free explainability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input → Mask generation network (two-layer CNN) → Perturbation → Student network (2 CNN + FC layer) → Joint optimization → Explanation

- Critical path: Input → Mask generation → Perturbation → Student distillation → Joint optimization → Explanation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Operating on raw input space (O(104)) vs. reduced segments (O(101)): Higher precision but increased computational complexity
  - Non-linear approximation vs. linear approximation: Better accuracy but potentially more complex optimization
  - Number of perturbation samples: More samples improve approximation but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Low IoU or deletion AUC scores: Indicates poor alignment between explanations and ground truth
  - Trivial mask (all ones or all zeros): Suggests issues with regularization or optimization
  - High variance in explanations across similar inputs: May indicate overfitting or sensitivity to noise

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the mask generation network produces a valid mask (values between 0 and 1) for a simple input.
  2. Check that the student network can approximate the black-box output for perturbed inputs.
  3. Evaluate the joint optimization by comparing IoU scores on a small validation set with different regularization weights.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas remain unexplored based on the evaluation scope and methodology presented.

## Limitations

- Specific architecture details for both networks are underspecified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Limited exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly regularization weights
- Performance on more diverse and challenging datasets beyond those presented is unknown
- Computational overhead of operating on raw input space not thoroughly analyzed

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Sensitivity Test**: Systematically vary the number of layers, filter sizes, and hidden units in both the mask generation and student networks to determine the minimal architecture needed for competitive performance.

2. **Perturbation Sample Efficiency Analysis**: Conduct an ablation study on the number of perturbed samples to quantify the trade-off between approximation accuracy and computational cost.

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization Evaluation**: Test DAX on datasets substantially different from those used in the paper to assess the method's robustness across domains.
