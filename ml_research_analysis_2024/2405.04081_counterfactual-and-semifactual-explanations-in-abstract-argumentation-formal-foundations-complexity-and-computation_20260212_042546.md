# Counterfactual and Semifactual Explanations in Abstract Argumentation: Formal Foundations, Complexity and Computation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.04081
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04081
- **Reference count:** 19
- **Primary result:** Introduces counterfactual and semifactual explanations in abstract argumentation, showing they are generally harder to compute than classical argumentation problems.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces counterfactual and semifactual reasoning in abstract argumentation frameworks to address the challenge of explainability in argumentation-based systems. The authors formally define counterfactual explanations as minimum-distance labellings that change the acceptance status of a goal argument, while semifactual explanations are maximum-distance labellings that preserve the status. They investigate the computational complexity of related reasoning problems, demonstrating they are generally harder than classical argumentation problems like credulous and skeptical acceptance. The authors show these problems can be encoded using weak-constrained argumentation frameworks and provide an algorithm using ASP solvers to compute the explanations.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes formal definitions of counterfactual and semifactual explanations in abstract argumentation frameworks, where counterfactuals are minimum-distance labellings altering a goal argument's status and semifactuals are maximum-distance labellings preserving it. The authors analyze the computational complexity of related reasoning problems, proving they are NP-complete or Σp₂-complete depending on the argumentation semantics. They demonstrate that these problems can be encoded using weak-constrained argumentation frameworks (WAFs) with appropriate strong and weak constraints, enabling computation via ASP solvers like asprin. The approach provides a computational strategy for generating interpretable explanations in argumentation-based decision-making systems.

## Key Results
- Counterfactual and semifactual explanations are defined via minimum and maximum distance labellings respectively, enabling interpretability of argumentation-based systems.
- The complexity of counterfactual and semifactual reasoning problems is generally higher than classical argumentation problems, especially for verification and credulous acceptance under preferred semantics.
- Counterfactual and semifactual explanations can be encoded using weak-constrained argumentation frameworks, enabling computation via ASP solvers.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Counterfactual and semifactual explanations in abstract argumentation are defined via minimum and maximum distance labellings respectively, allowing interpretability of argumentation-based systems.
- **Mechanism:** By introducing CFσ(g, L) as minimum-distance σ-labellings altering the acceptance status of a goal argument, and SFσ(g, L) as maximum-distance σ-labellings preserving it, the authors enable users to understand how minimal or maximal changes to solutions affect goal argument status.
- **Core assumption:** Distance between labellings can be computed as the number of arguments with different statuses, and this measure adequately captures the notion of "minimal" and "maximal" changes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Counterfactual and semifactual explanations are interpretability techniques that provide insights into the outcome of a model by generating alternative hypothetical instances."
  - [section] "A counterfactual of a given σ-labelling w.r.t. a given goal argument g is a minimum-distance σ-labelling L′ of Λ that changes the acceptance status of g."
- **Break condition:** If the distance measure fails to capture meaningful differences between labellings, or if the goal argument's status is ambiguous in certain labellings.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The complexity of counterfactual and semifactual reasoning problems is generally higher than classical argumentation problems, especially for verification and credulous acceptance under preferred semantics.
- **Mechanism:** By proving that CF-EXσ, CF-VEσ, CF-CAσ, CF-SAσ, SF-EXσ, SF-VEσ, SF-CAσ, and SF-SAσ problems are NP-complete or Σp₂-complete, the authors demonstrate that these reasoning tasks require more computational resources than traditional problems like existence, verification, and credulous/skeptical acceptance.
- **Core assumption:** The polynomial hierarchy accurately captures the relative difficulty of these reasoning problems, and the reductions used in the proofs are sound.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We investigate the computational complexity of counterfactual- and semifactual-based reasoning problems, showing that they are generally harder than classical argumentation problems such as credulous and skeptical acceptance."
  - [section] "Theorem 1. CF-EXσ is: NP-complete for σ ∈ {co, st}; and Σp₂-complete for σ ∈ {pr, sst}."
- **Break condition:** If the complexity class assignments are incorrect, or if there exist more efficient algorithms for these problems than currently known.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Counterfactual and semifactual explanations can be encoded using weak-constrained argumentation frameworks (WAFs), enabling computation via ASP solvers.
- **Mechanism:** By mapping counterfactuals to maximum-cardinality labellings of WAFs with strong constraints enforcing the goal argument's status change and weak constraints minimizing/maximizing the distance, and similarly for semifactuals, the authors provide a computational strategy using ASP solvers like asprin.
- **Core assumption:** The one-to-one correspondence between counterfactuals/semifactuals and maximum-cardinality labellings of appropriate WAFs holds, and ASP solvers can efficiently handle the resulting problems.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Finally, we show that counterfactual and semifactual queries can be encoded in weak-constrained Argumentation Framework, and provide a computational strategy through ASP solvers."
  - [section] "Proposition 1. For any AF Λ = ⟨A, R⟩, semantics σ ∈ {co, st, pr, sst}, goal g ∈ A, and σ-labelling L ∈ σ(Λ), CFσ(g, L) = mc-σ(⟨A, R, {¬ℓ(L, g)}, {ℓ(L, a) | a ∈ A \ {g}}⟩); SFσ(g, L) = mc-σ(⟨A, R, {ℓ(L, g)}, {¬ℓ(L, a) | a ∈ A \ {g}}⟩)."
- **Break condition:** If the WAF encoding fails to capture the semantics of counterfactuals and semifactuals, or if ASP solvers struggle with the resulting problem instances.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AFs)
  - Why needed here: The paper's contributions are based on extending AFs with counterfactual and semifactual reasoning, so a solid understanding of AFs is essential.
  - Quick check question: What are the components of an abstract argumentation framework, and how do they relate to each other?

- **Concept:** Argumentation Semantics (e.g., grounded, complete, preferred, stable, semi-stable)
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates counterfactual and semifactual reasoning under various argumentation semantics, so understanding their differences and properties is crucial.
  - Quick check question: How do the different argumentation semantics (grounded, complete, preferred, stable, semi-stable) differ in terms of the extensions they characterize?

- **Concept:** Computational Complexity Theory (e.g., NP, coNP, Σp₂, Πp₂)
  - Why needed here: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of counterfactual and semifactual reasoning problems, so familiarity with complexity classes and the polynomial hierarchy is necessary.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the complexity classes NP, coNP, Σp₂, and Πp₂, and how are they used to classify decision problems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Abstract Argumentation Framework (AF) -> Argumentation Semantics -> Counterfactual/Semifactual Explanations -> Weak-constrained Argumentation Framework (WAF) -> ASP Solver
- **Critical path:** To compute counterfactual and semifactual explanations, one must: 1) Define the AF and goal argument, 2) Choose the argumentation semantics, 3) Construct the appropriate WAF encoding, 4) Invoke an ASP solver to find maximum-cardinality labellings, and 5) Extract the explanations from the resulting labellings.
- **Design tradeoffs:** The use of WAFs and ASP solvers enables a general and flexible approach to computing counterfactual and semifactual explanations, but may incur higher computational costs compared to specialized algorithms for specific cases.
- **Failure signatures:** If the computed explanations do not satisfy the desired properties (e.g., minimal/maximal distance, correct goal argument status), there may be issues with the WAF encoding, ASP solver configuration, or the underlying AF semantics.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the ASP encoding for a simple AF (e.g., with 3-4 arguments) and verify that the computed counterfactual and semifactual explanations match manual calculations.
  2. Test the approach on AFs with different argumentation semantics (e.g., grounded, complete, preferred) and compare the complexity of computing explanations across semantics.
  3. Evaluate the scalability of the approach by increasing the size of the AF and measuring the impact on computation time and solution quality.

- **Low confidence**: Performance comparisons with alternative explanation methods, robustness to noisy or incomplete argumentation frameworks

## Next Checks

1. **ASP Encoding Verification**: Implement the weak-constrained argumentation framework encoding for a small, manually-verifiable argumentation example (3-5 arguments) and confirm that the ASP solver correctly computes the counterfactual and semifactual explanations matching theoretical expectations.

2. **Complexity Validation**: Construct specific argumentation framework instances that would serve as witnesses for the NP-hardness and Σp₂-hardness proofs, and verify that solving the corresponding counterfactual/semifactual problems is indeed computationally challenging in practice.

3. **Scalability Experiment**: Test the approach on progressively larger argumentation frameworks (starting from 10 arguments up to 100+ arguments) and measure how computation time scales with framework size, particularly comparing the overhead of counterfactual/semifactual reasoning versus standard credulous/skeptical acceptance.
