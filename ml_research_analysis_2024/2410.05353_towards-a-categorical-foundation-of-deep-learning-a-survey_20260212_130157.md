- This thesis surveys categorical approaches to deep learning, aiming to provide theoretical underpinnings for a field currently lacking strong mathematical foundations.

## Executive Summary
This thesis surveys categorical approaches to deep learning, aiming to provide theoretical underpinnings for a field currently lacking strong mathematical foundations. It focuses on four main themes: parametric optics for gradient-based learning, bridging classical computer science with neural networks, functor learning for structure preservation, and detailed diagrammatic representations of neural networks. The work proposes categorical frameworks that could unify and extend current deep learning methodologies while addressing reproducibility concerns in machine learning research.

## Method Summary
The thesis presents four main categorical approaches to deep learning: (1) parametric optics combining differential categories and optics for compositional gradient-based learning, (2) using categorical algebra homomorphisms to recover and classify neural network architectures from classical data structures, (3) functor learning to preserve categorical structure during learning tasks, and (4) string diagrammatic representations for unambiguous neural network specifications. Each approach builds on category theory foundations while targeting specific limitations in current deep learning practice.

## Key Results
- Parametric optics framework provides compositional model for gradient-based learning with performance comparable to traditional tools
- Functor learning preserves structural relationships in data, improving effectiveness for unsupervised translation and equivariant classification
- Neural circuit diagrams offer detailed, unambiguous representations that could improve reproducibility
- Categorical approaches generalize geometric deep learning by using (co)algebra homomorphisms to recover neural architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Categorical optics provide a unified compositional framework for gradient-based learning that can model both forward and backward passes.
- **Mechanism**: The Para construction wraps parameterized maps with parameter spaces, while weighted optics generalize bidirectional data flow. Differential categories supply the reverse derivative combinator R, and parametric lenses combine these to form a complete gradient learning system.
- **Core assumption**: The underlying category is a generalized Cartesian reverse differential category where R is well-defined and compatible with the Para structure.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "categorical optics to model gradient-based learning"
  - [section]: "we can use 2-categorical machinery of Para‚pLensApCqq to provide a loss function, a learning rate, and an optimizer"
  - [corpus]: No direct citation of R implementation, but similar framework exists in [CGG`22]
- **Break condition**: If the category lacks a proper reverse derivative combinator or the Para structure fails to preserve compositionality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Functor learning preserves structural relationships in data, leading to more effective and efficient models.
- **Mechanism**: By learning functors instead of morphisms, the framework maintains categorical structure (objects, morphisms, compositions) during embedding and translation tasks. This allows unsupervised translation to respect chemical bond relations and enables compositional distributional models for NLP.
- **Core assumption**: The data naturally admits a meaningful categorical structure that is preserved under the learned functor.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure"
  - [section]: "Unsupervised functorial translation" and "Compositional distributional model for NLP"
  - [corpus]: No specific citations, but [SY21] demonstrates effectiveness on chemical translation
- **Break condition**: If the assumed categorical structure does not reflect meaningful semantic relationships in the data.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Detailed string diagram representations improve reproducibility by encoding all implementation-relevant details.
- **Mechanism**: Neural circuit diagrams and functor string diagrams capture dimensionality, indexing, broadcasting, and tensor operations in a standardized visual language. This replaces ambiguous prose descriptions and ad-hoc diagrams with precise, mathematically grounded specifications.
- **Core assumption**: The diagrammatic notation can represent all necessary implementation details without becoming unreadable.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures"
  - [section]: "Neural circuit diagrams" and "Diagrams with universal approximators"
  - [corpus]: No direct citations, but [Abb24] demonstrates transformer representation with full detail
- **Break condition**: If diagrams become too complex to parse or if critical details are still omitted.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Category Theory Basics**
  - Why needed here: All approaches in the thesis rely on categorical abstractions like functors, natural transformations, and monoidal structures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a functor and a natural transformation in your own words?

- **Concept: Neural Network Fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: The thesis applies categorical methods specifically to deep learning architectures and gradient-based optimization.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of backpropagation in training neural networks, and how does it relate to the backward pass in optics?

- **Concept: Differential Calculus**
  - Why needed here: Gradient-based learning requires differentiation, and the thesis uses differential categories to generalize this concept.
  - Quick check question: How does the reverse derivative combinator R in a Cartesian reverse differential category differ from ordinary differentiation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Categorical framework layer: Defines the mathematical structures (categories, functors, optics)
  - Learning algorithm layer: Implements gradient-based optimization using the framework
  - Application layer: Specific tasks like translation, classification, or architecture design

- **Critical path**: Choose appropriate categorical structures → Define parametric maps and optics → Implement reverse derivative → Train using loss/optimizer → Evaluate on task

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Expressivity vs. simplicity: More general categorical structures
