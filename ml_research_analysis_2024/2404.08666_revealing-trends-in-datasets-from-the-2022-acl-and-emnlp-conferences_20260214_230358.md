# Revealing Trends in Datasets from the 2022 ACL and EMNLP Conferences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08666
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08666
- Reference count: 40
- Most datasets are English-centric, fall in 10K–50K instance range, and focus on text generation, summarization, classification, and information extraction.

## Executive Summary
This paper surveys 92 new NLP datasets from the 2022 ACL and EMNLP conferences, categorizing them by task, size, language, source, and author affiliation. Most datasets target English and fall into the 10K–50K instance range, with text generation, summarization, classification, and information extraction being the most common tasks. Multilingual datasets are present but still limited; only BLOOM covers 363 languages. Collaboration patterns show mixed academia–industry teams, with industry contributing resources and academia providing methodological expertise. Multimodal datasets are increasing, supporting vision–language tasks. Data sources include online repositories, Wikipedia, news, and crowdsourcing, with prompt-based generation emerging as a novel data collection method. The analysis offers insights and guidance for future dataset curation in NLP.

## Method Summary
The authors manually reviewed 92 NLP dataset papers from ACL2022 and EMNLP2022, filtering from an initial pool of 130 papers using keywords "dataset" and "corpus." They extracted and categorized dataset attributes including name, size, NLP topic, baselines, multilingual status, and author affiliations. Datasets were analyzed by task type, size range, language coverage, and data sources to identify trends and patterns in dataset creation.

## Key Results
- Most datasets are English-centric and fall within the 10K–50K instance range.
- Text generation, summarization, classification, and information extraction are the most common tasks.
- Industry-academia collaborations are common, with industry providing data and resources, and academia contributing methodological expertise.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Industry-academia collaboration drives dataset quality and innovation.
- Mechanism: Industry provides large-scale data, computational resources, and real-world use cases; academia contributes methodological rigor and novel techniques.
- Core assumption: Data access and computational infrastructure are rate-limiting factors for dataset creation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5]: "Most papers consist of authors hailing from both academia and industry. This points to the advantages enjoyed when industry and academia researchers collaborate. It re-emphasizes long-held beliefs that the industrial labs provide the practical use cases, large-scale data, computing resources, and funds to foot the costs necessary to build a new dataset."
  - [section 5]: "Out of the forty-three papers in which the industry and academic researchers collaborated, the number of academic last authors is 20 while industry last authors is 23."
- Break condition: If collaboration is purely nominal or if industry authors contribute only minimal or non-technical resources, the expected gains in dataset quality and innovation may not materialize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multilingual dataset creation is still limited by linguistic diversity and data scarcity.
- Mechanism: Most datasets focus on English; non-English and multilingual datasets are far fewer and often cover only a small set of languages.
- Core assumption: The availability of large-scale, high-quality training data in a language is essential for effective multilingual NLP system development.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 8]: "Unsurprisingly, most datasets published at ACL and EMNLP conferences contain English text. However, there is a notable number of non-English datasets, too."
  - [section 8]: "BLOOM covers 363 languages" is noted as exceptional.
  - [section 8]: "most datasets published at ACL and EMNLP conferences contain English text."
- Break condition: If multilingual datasets become significantly more common and balanced across languages, the current limitation may no longer hold.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Emerging prompt-based data collection methods reduce cost and time barriers for dataset creation.
- Mechanism: Large language models can be prompted to generate synthetic examples, alleviating the need for manual annotation or real-world data collection.
- Core assumption: Generated data is sufficiently representative and high-quality for training robust NLP models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 9]: "We note that prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate training examples has emerged as a new method to overcome the time and budget constraints that come with recruiting human annotators."
  - [corpus]: No specific cited papers using this method are listed; the observation is general.
- Break condition: If generated examples introduce bias or fail to cover real-world linguistic variability, the cost and time savings may not translate into model performance gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dataset size and its impact on model performance.
  - Why needed here: Understanding that most datasets fall in the 10K–50K instance range is crucial for setting realistic expectations for dataset curation and model training.
  - Quick check question: Why might a dataset with fewer than 10,000 instances still be valuable for NLP research?

- Concept: Multilingualism and multimodality in dataset creation.
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the scarcity of multilingual and multimodal datasets is essential for identifying gaps and opportunities in NLP research.
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when curating datasets that span more than 100 languages?

- Concept: Collaboration patterns between academia and industry.
  - Why needed here: Knowing the typical roles of each sector helps in designing effective research partnerships and resource allocation.
  - Quick check question: How might the contributions of industry and academia differ in a dataset creation project?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data collection module -> Annotation pipeline -> Quality assurance layer -> Metadata tracker -> Integration hooks

- Critical path:
  1. Identify research need and task.
  2. Select data sources and collection method.
  3. Execute collection and annotation.
  4. Perform quality checks.
  5. Publish dataset with comprehensive metadata.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual annotation ensures quality but is costly and slow; prompt generation is faster but may introduce bias.
  - Focusing on English maximizes dataset size and utility but limits linguistic diversity; including more languages increases inclusivity but reduces data per language.
  - Collaboration with industry accelerates resource access but may introduce conflicts of interest or proprietary constraints.

- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete or inconsistent metadata leading to poor reproducibility.
  - Over-reliance on synthetic data causing models to miss real-world linguistic patterns.
  - Imbalanced language representation limiting multilingual model effectiveness.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Create a small multilingual dataset using both manual annotation and LLM prompt generation; compare quality and diversity.
  2. Test the impact of dataset size (e.g., 5K vs. 50K examples) on model performance for a classification task.
  3. Analyze collaboration outcomes by comparing datasets with and without industry involvement, focusing on resource access and methodological innovation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the challenges and best practices for curating high-quality multilingual datasets, and how can these be addressed to reduce the language gap in NLP?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the multilingual aspect of datasets, noting that most datasets are in English, but there is a notable number of non-English datasets. It categorizes datasets into non-English monolingual and multilingual, but does not provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges or best practices for curating multilingual datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the specific challenges faced in curating high-quality multilingual datasets, such as data availability, annotation quality, and language-specific nuances. It also does not provide insights into best practices or strategies to address these challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study of multilingual dataset curation, analyzing the challenges faced, best practices employed, and strategies to address the language gap in NLP. This could include surveys of dataset curators, case studies of successful multilingual projects, and experiments comparing the performance of models trained on multilingual versus monolingual datasets.

## Limitations

- Survey limited to ACL and EMNLP 2022 conferences, may not represent broader NLP trends.
- Analysis relies on paper metadata and self-reported dataset characteristics, which may contain inconsistencies.
- Categorization of author affiliations into "academia" and "industry" may oversimplify complex institutional relationships.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Dataset size distribution (10K–50K instances being most common) and task distribution (text generation, summarization, classification, information extraction as most frequent).
- Medium Confidence: Industry-academia collaboration benefits - while the data shows mixed authorship patterns, the causal link between collaboration and dataset quality requires further validation.
- Medium Confidence: Multilingual dataset scarcity - the survey confirms English dominance, but the full landscape of multilingual NLP datasets may extend beyond the surveyed conferences.

## Next Checks

1. Expand the survey to include additional NLP conferences (NAACL, COLING, AAAI, ICML) to assess whether 2022 ACL/EMNLP trends generalize across the field.
2. Conduct a systematic audit of multilingual dataset coverage by mapping each surveyed dataset's language support against global language demographics and digital resource availability.
3. Perform a detailed case analysis of industry-academia collaborations by examining resource attribution statements, funding acknowledgments, and author contribution statements in the surveyed papers to validate claimed benefits.
