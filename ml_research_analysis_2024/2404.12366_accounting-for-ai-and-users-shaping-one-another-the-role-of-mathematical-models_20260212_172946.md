# Accounting for AI and Users Shaping One Another: The Role of Mathematical Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.12366
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12366
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Formal interaction models enable anticipation of societal impacts by explicitly capturing how AI and users shape one another over time

## Executive Summary
This paper argues for the development of formal interaction models to mathematically capture how AI systems and users shape one another. These models can be leveraged to specify interactions for implementation, monitor interactions through empirical analysis, anticipate societal impacts via counterfactual analysis, and control societal impacts via interventions. The authors critically examine the nascent literature of formal interaction models using content recommender systems as a case study, finding that most work focuses on anticipating and controlling societal impacts. They identify opportunities for future work including enriching the style of models for viewer and creator interactions, and integrating models of viewer and creator interactions into a single coupled dynamical system.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a framework for understanding AI-user interactions through coupled dynamical systems. The authors cast existing formal interaction models within this framework and analyze them along four axes: style (parametric vs non-parametric), granularity (fully parametric vs partially structured), mathematical complexity, and measurability. They use content recommender systems as a case study to demonstrate how this framework can be applied and identify opportunities for future work.

## Key Results
- Formal interaction models can specify AI-user interactions for implementation, monitor real-world deployments, anticipate societal impacts, and enable interventions
- Current literature on formal interaction models is nascent and primarily focuses on anticipating and controlling societal impacts
- There are significant opportunities for future work in enriching model styles for viewer and creator interactions, and integrating these into coupled dynamical systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Formal interaction models enable anticipation of societal impacts by explicitly capturing how AI and users shape one another over time.
- Mechanism: The coupled dynamical system formulation allows researchers to simulate counterfactual environments and analyze how changes in algorithm parameters or user behavior propagate through the system, revealing potential unintended consequences before deployment.
- Core assumption: The mathematical model accurately captures the key causal relationships between AI outputs and user state changes, and between user outputs and AI state changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Formal interaction models can be leveraged to... anticipate societal impacts via counterfactual analysis"
  - [section 2.2] "analyses of formal interaction models (via theoretical analyses or simulations) can reveal how the algorithm parameters and the broader environment together influence the strength and nature of the societal impact"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break Condition: If the model misses critical feedback loops or misrepresents the causal relationships, the anticipated impacts will be inaccurate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Formal interaction models improve algorithm design by surfacing new metrics that capture societal impacts beyond traditional engagement measures.
- Mechanism: By mathematically formalizing the interaction dynamics, the model reveals parameters and combinations of parameters that represent broader societal values. These can then be incorporated into the optimization objective.
- Core assumption: The model's mathematical structure makes it possible to derive meaningful metrics that capture the intended societal impacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Formal interaction models can be leveraged to... control societal impacts via interventions"
  - [section 2.2] "Formal interaction models can surface new metrics that can be optimized by supervised learning or RL-based algorithms to control societal impacts"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break Condition: If the societal impact cannot be captured by measurable parameters in the model, or if optimizing for the new metric creates other unintended consequences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Formal interaction models enable empirical monitoring of AI-user interactions in deployed systems by formalizing constructs as measurable variables.
- Mechanism: The mathematical model defines specific variables and parameters that represent interaction patterns. These can then be estimated from real-world data to assess the strength and character of interactions.
- Core assumption: The model is identifiable and the parameters can be estimated from observable data about real-world interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Formal interaction models can be leveraged to... monitor interactions through empirical analysis"
  - [section 2.2] "Formal interaction models can be leveraged to monitor the strength and character of interactions between AI systems and users in real-world deployments"
  - [section 2.3] "Examples of highly measurable models include parametric models based on observable constructs such as watch time and clicks"
- Break Condition: If the model parameters are unidentifiable or if the relevant constructs cannot be measured from observable data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dynamical Systems
  - Why needed here: The paper casts formal interaction models as coupled dynamical systems, which provides a unifying framework for comparing different mathematical approaches and understanding the temporal evolution of AI-user interactions.
  - Quick check question: In a dynamical system, if the state update function f depends on future inputs, does this violate causality? (Answer: Yes)

- Concept: Coupled Dynamical Systems
  - Why needed here: Formal interaction models involve multiple interconnected systems (AI and users), requiring an understanding of how individual system dynamics interact through their inputs and outputs.
  - Quick check question: In a coupled dynamical system, if the AI system's output at time t is the input to all users at time t, and the users' outputs form the input to the AI system at time t+1, what is the minimum delay in the feedback loop? (Answer: 1 time step)

- Concept: State Update Functions
  - Why needed here: The state update functions f_i capture how the AI system shapes each user's internal state, which is the key distinguishing feature of formal interaction models versus models where user states are static.
  - Quick check question: If a user's internal state x_i doesn't change based on the AI system's output y_a (i.e., f_i is independent of y_a), would this be considered a formal interaction model? (Answer: No, according to the paper's definition)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: x_a (AI state) -> f_a (AI update) -> y_a = g_a(x_a, u_a, w_a) (AI outputs) -> [u_i = y_a for each user i] -> x_i (user states) -> f_i (user updates) -> y_i = g_i(x_i, u_i, w_i) (user outputs) -> [u_a = [y_1, ..., y_n] (AI inputs)

- Critical path: The sequence of data flow from AI outputs to user state updates to user outputs to AI inputs. The most critical part is ensuring the state update functions f_i nontrivially depend on the AI outputs.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: More complex models may capture more nuanced interactions but become harder to analyze and interpret
  - Granularity vs. measurability: Highly granular models may be more accurate but harder to estimate from real data
  - Parametric vs. non-parametric: Parametric models are more interpretable but may miss important patterns; non-parametric models are more flexible but less interpretable

- Failure signatures:
  - If state update functions f_i don't actually change based on AI outputs, the model doesn't capture meaningful interactions
  - If measurement equations g_i don't produce outputs that can be observed in real deployments, the model can't be validated
  - If the model becomes unstable or exhibits unrealistic behavior in simulations, the mathematical formulation may be flawed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple coupled dynamical system with one user and verify that the user state changes based on AI outputs, and that the AI state changes based on user outputs
  2. Simulate counterfactual scenarios by modifying algorithm parameters and observe how the system behavior changes
  3. Test model identifiability by attempting to estimate parameters from synthetic data with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal granularity for formal interaction models when the primary goal is specifying interactions for implementation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "When specifying interactions for the purpose of designing simulators, we view granularity as the most important axis."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides general guidelines but does not quantify what level of granularity (e.g., fully parametric vs. partially structured) is optimal for implementation purposes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of simulator performance using models with varying levels of granularity across multiple domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can formal interaction models be effectively integrated into the design of large language model-based ecosystems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "In the coming years, we expect that this will also include language models, which are being augmented with external tools and integrated into broader ecosystems, creating new forms of AI-user interactions."
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the need for such models in LLM contexts, it does not provide concrete approaches for capturing the complex interactions between users and LLM-based systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of formal interaction models specifically designed for LLM-user ecosystems, demonstrating their effectiveness in anticipating and controlling societal impacts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the key factors that determine the measurability of constructs in formal interaction models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss measurability as a critical axis, noting that "The measurability of a model captures how feasible it is to measure the mathematical constructs of the formal interaction model with real-world observable data."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies measurability as important but does not provide a comprehensive framework for determining which constructs can be reliably measured and which cannot.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic analysis of different model constructs across domains, identifying patterns in what makes certain variables measurable versus unmeasurable.

## Limitations
- The paper provides a conceptual framework but lacks concrete validation across multiple AI domains
- The dynamical systems formulation may oversimplify complex real-world interactions
- Many parameters that would be theoretically valuable for understanding interactions may be impossible to estimate from observational data alone

## Confidence
- High confidence: The conceptual value of formal interaction models and the importance of mathematical formalization for specifying and monitoring interactions
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of dynamical systems for capturing temporal evolution of interactions
- Low confidence: The practical feasibility of implementing and estimating these models across diverse AI domains

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on a non-recommender system domain (e.g., hiring decision-support systems) by constructing a coupled dynamical system and attempting to identify parameters from synthetic data
2. Conduct a systematic survey of existing AI systems to catalog which constructs from formal interaction models are actually measurable in practice
3. Develop and validate a simplified prototype implementation of a formal interaction model for a real-world deployment, measuring the gap between theoretical predictions and observed interactions
