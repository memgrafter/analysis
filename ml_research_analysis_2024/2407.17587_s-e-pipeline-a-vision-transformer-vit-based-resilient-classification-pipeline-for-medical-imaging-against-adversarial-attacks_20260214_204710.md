# S-E Pipeline: A Vision Transformer (ViT) based Resilient Classification Pipeline for Medical Imaging Against Adversarial Attacks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.17587
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17587
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: Segmentation-enhancement pipeline reduces adversarial attack effectiveness on medical imaging models by up to 86.58% for ViT-l32 against FGSM attacks

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the vulnerability of Vision Transformers to adversarial attacks in medical imaging, proposing a segmentation-enhancement (S-E) pipeline that combines image segmentation with enhancement techniques (CLAHE, Unsharp Masking, High-Frequency Emphasis) to reduce the impact of adversarial perturbations. The S-E pipeline preprocesses chest X-ray images to preserve critical features even under attack, improving robustness when used with both ViTs and CNNs. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in adversarial attack effectiveness: 72.22% for ViT-b32 and 86.58% for ViT-l32 models against FGSM attacks, with practical deployment shown on resource-constrained NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano hardware.

## Method Summary
The proposed S-E pipeline employs a two-stage preprocessing approach for chest X-ray images. First, U-Net performs image segmentation to isolate regions of interest. Second, three enhancement techniques are applied sequentially: Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve local contrast, Unsharp Masking to sharpen edges, and High-Frequency Emphasis filtering to boost high-frequency components. This preprocessing pipeline is designed to preserve critical anatomical features while mitigating adversarial perturbations before classification by either Vision Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks. The approach requires no architectural modifications to existing models, making it a practical defense mechanism for clinical deployment.

## Key Results
- S-E pipeline reduces adversarial attack effectiveness by 72.22% for ViT-b32 and 86.58% for ViT-l32 models against FGSM attacks
- Robustness improvements demonstrated across both ViT and CNN architectures without model modifications
- Successful deployment and validation on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano edge computing hardware

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The S-E pipeline works by isolating and enhancing medically relevant regions of chest X-ray images before classification. Adversarial attacks typically introduce perturbations that are subtle but can significantly alter model predictions. By segmenting the image to focus on regions of interest (lungs, heart, etc.) and then applying enhancement techniques that boost local contrast and high-frequency features, the pipeline makes the classification task more resilient to these perturbations. The preprocessing effectively creates a "clean" version of the image that preserves the essential diagnostic information while reducing the impact of adversarial noise. This approach leverages the fact that medical imaging relies on specific anatomical features, which can be preserved and enhanced through targeted preprocessing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: Transformer architectures adapted for image classification that process images as sequences of patches. Why needed: Understanding ViT vulnerability to adversarial attacks motivates the defense mechanism. Quick check: Verify that the ViT models used are standard implementations without architectural modifications.
- **Adversarial Attacks (FGSM)**: Fast Gradient Sign Method that creates adversarial examples by adding perturbations in the direction of the gradient of the loss function. Why needed: FGSM is the attack method used to evaluate the pipeline's effectiveness. Quick check: Confirm that the FGSM implementation uses appropriate epsilon values for medical imaging.
- **Image Segmentation with U-Net**: Encoder-decoder architecture for semantic segmentation that identifies regions of interest in medical images. Why needed: Segmentation isolates medically relevant areas for targeted enhancement. Quick check: Verify segmentation accuracy on chest X-ray datasets before applying enhancements.
- **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**: Enhancement technique that improves local contrast while preventing over-amplification of noise. Why needed: CLAHE preserves local features important for diagnosis. Quick check: Ensure CLAHE parameters (clip limit, tile grid size) are optimized for chest X-ray characteristics.
- **High-Frequency Emphasis Filtering**: Frequency domain technique that boosts high-frequency components corresponding to edges and fine details. Why needed: Medical diagnoses often depend on subtle anatomical details. Quick check: Verify that high-frequency emphasis doesn't amplify noise beyond acceptable levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Raw Image -> U-Net Segmentation -> CLAHE Enhancement -> Unsharp Masking -> High-Frequency Emphasis -> Enhanced Image -> Classification Model (ViT/CNN)

Critical Path:
The critical path involves sequential processing through all five preprocessing stages before classification. Each stage must complete before the next begins, with the total preprocessing time contributing to system latency. The U-Net segmentation is the most computationally intensive component, followed by the frequency domain operations in high-frequency emphasis.

Design Tradeoffs:
The pipeline trades computational overhead for robustness. While the sequential application of five preprocessing stages adds latency, it provides significant protection against adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining or architectural changes. The choice of three enhancement techniques represents a balance between effectiveness and computational cost. Alternative approaches like ensembling multiple models or adversarial training were not considered, focusing instead on preprocessing-based defense.

Failure Signatures:
If segmentation fails to accurately identify regions of interest, subsequent enhancements will be applied to irrelevant areas, reducing effectiveness. Over-aggressive enhancement parameters can amplify noise or create artifacts that mislead the classifier. The pipeline may be vulnerable to attacks specifically designed to target preprocessing stages rather than the classifier itself. Performance degradation may occur if the enhancement parameters are not optimized for specific imaging equipment or patient populations.

First Experiments to Run:
1. Test the S-E pipeline on a held-out test set without adversarial perturbations to establish baseline performance and ensure preprocessing doesn't degrade clean image accuracy
2. Apply the pipeline to a single adversarial example from each attack type to visually verify that preprocessing mitigates visible perturbations
3. Measure preprocessing latency on target deployment hardware (Jetson Orin Nano) to quantify computational overhead for real-time clinical applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to chest X-ray datasets, restricting generalizability to other medical imaging modalities
- Robustness gains demonstrated only against FGSM attacks, not tested against more sophisticated methods like PGD or AutoAttack
- Computational overhead of preprocessing pipeline not quantified for real-time clinical deployment scenarios
- Segmentation component relies on U-Net, which itself could be vulnerable to adversarial attacks

## Confidence
- Claim of reduced adversarial attack effectiveness: **Medium** confidence (only validated against FGSM with fixed parameters)
- Claim of Jetson Orin Nano deployment: **High** confidence (straightforward hardware compatibility)
- Claim of preprocessing effectiveness: **Medium** confidence (limited attack scope and dataset diversity)

## Next Checks
1. Test the S-E pipeline against multiple attack types including PGD, CW, and AutoAttack to assess robustness beyond FGSM
2. Evaluate the approach on diverse medical imaging modalities such as CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound to verify cross-domain applicability
3. Measure and report the computational overhead and latency introduced by the preprocessing pipeline in real-time clinical scenarios
