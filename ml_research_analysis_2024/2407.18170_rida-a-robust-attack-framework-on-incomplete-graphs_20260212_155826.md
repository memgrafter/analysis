# RIDA: A Robust Attack Framework on Incomplete Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.18170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18170
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: RIDA significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets, degrading target model accuracy by an average of 4.89% and 4.33% when 10% and 30% of vertex attributes are missing, respectively.

## Executive Summary
RIDA is the first robust framework for gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs, addressing the critical gap where existing attack methods assume complete graph information. The framework enhances a surrogate model's capability to propagate information across entire graphs despite missing vertex attributes. Through three key modules—Depth-plus GNN for long-range information propagation, Local-global Aggregation for refined feature aggregation, and Holistic Adversarial Attack for effective poisoning—RIDA achieves significant performance improvements over existing baselines on real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
RIDA addresses poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs through a three-module framework. The Depth-plus GNN module removes nonlinear activations and uses decay parameters to retain original information while enabling distant vertex features to influence aggregation. The Local-global Aggregation module employs attention mechanisms that balance local changes and global stability through cosine distance-based coefficients. The Holistic Adversarial Attack module incorporates positional encoding and intermediate adjacency matrices to optimize attack features using the entire graph's structural information. The framework trains on incomplete graphs to guide effective attacks on target GNN models.

## Key Results
- RIDA degrades target model accuracy by 4.89% (10% missing attributes) and 4.33% (30% missing attributes) on average
- Shows 1.53% and 1.24% average relative improvement over second-best baseline at 10% and 30% missing attributes respectively
- Significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art baselines (DICE, EpoAtk, GraD, PGD, Meta-Self, Meta-Train, A-Meta-Self, A-Meta-Train, A-Meta-Both) across three real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RIDA's Depth-plus GNN module enables effective long-range information propagation on incomplete graphs.
- Mechanism: By removing nonlinear activations and controlling propagation with a decay parameter, the module retains more original information during propagation while allowing distant vertex features to influence aggregation.
- Core assumption: Missing attributes can be compensated by propagating information from distant vertices without introducing significant noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It is the first algorithm for robust gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs... incorporates a Depth-plus GNN module for long-range information propagation."
  - [section]: "The Depth-plus GNN module improves long-range information propagation, addressing the failure of surrogate models on incomplete graphs."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers focus on general GNN robustness but don't specifically address long-range propagation on incomplete graphs.
- Break condition: If the decay parameter is poorly tuned, distant information may dominate or be suppressed, reducing attack effectiveness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Local-global Aggregation module refines feature aggregation through attention mechanisms that balance local and global perspectives.
- Mechanism: It calculates cosine distance-based attention coefficients between consecutive layers (local) and between current layer and original features (global), then uses these coefficients to weight feature propagation.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively distinguish between important local changes and stable global features even with missing attributes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The Local-global Aggregation module refines feature aggregation to further optimize the performance of surrogate model."
  - [section]: "local attention guides the model in preserving important information during long-range propagation, while global attention helps the model retain the original vertex attribute information."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus papers about this specific attention mechanism design.
- Break condition: If attention coefficients become too uniform due to missing attributes, the model loses its ability to distinguish important features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Holistic Adversarial Attack module optimizes features for attack effectiveness on incomplete graphs by incorporating positional encoding.
- Mechanism: It constructs intermediate adjacency matrices to preserve vertex connections, distinguishes feature propagation weights at different distances, and optimizes attack features using the entire graph's structural information.
- Core assumption: Incorporating structural information through positional encoding compensates for missing attribute information during attacks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The Holistic Adversarial Attack module optimizes and applies perturbations, enabling the final poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs."
  - [section]: "The Holistic Adversarial Attack module optimizes the features involved in the attack process, allowing the model to fully utilize the entire graph's information when attacking incomplete graphs."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss general adversarial attacks but not specific feature optimization strategies for incomplete graphs.
- Break condition: If the optimization becomes computationally prohibitive or fails to converge, attack effectiveness may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks and their information propagation mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GNNs aggregate and propagate information is crucial for grasping how RIDA enhances this process for incomplete graphs
  - Quick check question: How does a standard GCN aggregate information from neighboring vertices, and what limitations does this create for incomplete graphs?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks and poisoning attacks on machine learning models
  - Why needed here: RIDA is designed specifically for poisoning attacks, so understanding attack objectives and methodologies is essential
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes poisoning attacks from evasion attacks, and why are poisoning attacks particularly effective against GNNs?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and their application in graph neural networks
  - Why needed here: The Local-global Aggregation module relies on attention to balance local and global feature importance
  - Quick check question: How do attention mechanisms typically work in graph neural networks, and what advantages do they offer over standard aggregation methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Depth-plus GNN module → Local-global Aggregation module → Holistic Adversarial Attack module → Surrogate model → Perturbed graph → Target model degradation

- Critical path: Incomplete graph → Depth-plus GNN propagation → Local-global aggregation → Holistic Adversarial Attack → Perturbed graph → Target model degradation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Propagation depth vs. computational cost (trade-off in choosing K layers)
  - Attention mechanism complexity vs. stability on incomplete data
  - Feature optimization intensity vs. attack stealthiness

- Failure signatures:
  - Surrogate model performance drops significantly with increasing missing attributes
  - Attack effectiveness decreases when 𝛽 (proportion of vertices with incomplete attributes) increases
  - Feature propagation becomes unstable when propagation distance K is too large

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Depth-plus GNN module performance on graphs with varying levels of missing attributes (different 𝛼 and 𝛽 values)
  2. Evaluate Local-global Aggregation module with and without attention mechanisms on incomplete graphs
  3. Compare Holistic Adversarial Attack module performance with baseline feature optimization strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does RIDA's performance scale with increasing graph size and complexity (e.g., larger graphs with more vertices and edges)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates RIDA on three real-world datasets (CORA, CORA-ML, CITESEER) but does not explore scalability to larger graphs or those with different structural properties.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on moderate-sized datasets, leaving open how the model's performance, computational efficiency, and robustness hold up as graph size and complexity increase.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on larger graphs with varying densities, edge counts, and vertex attributes, along with runtime and memory usage analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can RIDA's attack strategies be adapted to defend against poisoning attacks in incomplete graph scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on using RIDA as an attack framework to degrade GNN performance, but does not explore its potential for defense mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate whether the same principles (e.g., depth-plus GNN, local-global aggregation) can be inverted to enhance GNN robustness against attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating RIDA's effectiveness in detecting or mitigating poisoning attacks, or theoretical analysis of its defensive capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does RIDA perform in dynamic graph scenarios where the graph structure and attributes evolve over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes static graphs, but real-world applications often involve dynamic graphs with changing structures and attributes.
- Why unresolved: The model's modules (e.g., depth-plus GNN, holistic adversarial attack) are not explicitly designed for temporal or streaming graph data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on dynamic graphs with temporal updates, evaluating RIDA's ability to adapt to changes in graph structure and attribute completeness over time.

## Limitations

- Empirical scope limited to three citation network datasets, which may not generalize to other graph types
- Assumes uniform random missing attributes rather than realistic data incompleteness patterns
- Does not provide detailed computational complexity analysis or runtime comparisons with baselines

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The overall framework design and the identification of incomplete graph attacks as an important problem domain
- **Medium confidence**: The specific architectural choices (Depth-plus GNN, Local-global Aggregation) and their claimed benefits for incomplete graphs
- **Low confidence**: The theoretical justification for why the proposed modules specifically address the challenges of incomplete graph attacks better than general GNN robustness techniques

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Test RIDA on non-citation graph datasets (e.g., social networks, biological networks) to verify performance across different graph structures and attribute distributions
2. **Varying Attack Budgets**: Evaluate RIDA's effectiveness across a wider range of edge modification budgets (beyond just ε=5%) to understand its scalability and efficiency
3. **Theoretical Analysis**: Conduct a formal robustness analysis comparing RIDA's performance bounds with existing robust GNN methods to establish theoretical advantages beyond empirical results
