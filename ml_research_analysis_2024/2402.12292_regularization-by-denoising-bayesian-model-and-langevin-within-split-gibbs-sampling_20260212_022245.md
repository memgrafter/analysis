# Regularization by denoising: Bayesian model and Langevin-within-split Gibbs sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12292
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12292
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A Bayesian framework for RED with a novel Langevin-within-Split Gibbs sampling algorithm enabling uncertainty quantification in imaging inverse problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for regularization-by-denoising (RED) in imaging inverse problems, providing a probabilistic interpretation of RED and a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the resulting posterior distribution. The proposed Langevin-within-Split Gibbs sampling (LwSGS) method embeds a Langevin Monte Carlo step within a split Gibbs sampler, leveraging an asymptotically exact data augmentation scheme to simplify sampling from complex conditional distributions. The approach bridges the gap between data-driven regularization via denoisers and Bayesian inference, offering both competitive reconstruction performance and principled uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis ensures convergence and quantifies bias, while experiments on deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The method develops a probabilistic counterpart to RED by deriving a prior distribution induced by a denoising neural network, which is then integrated into a Bayesian model for inverse problems. To sample from the posterior, the authors propose Langevin-within-Split Gibbs sampling (LwSGS), a novel Monte Carlo algorithm that combines a split Gibbs sampler with a Langevin Monte Carlo step for one of the conditional distributions. This approach exploits an asymptotically exact data augmentation scheme, allowing efficient sampling even when direct sampling from conditionals is intractable. The framework supports both traditional and data-driven regularizers, enabling the use of pre-trained denoisers as regularizers in a principled Bayesian setting.

## Key Results
- LwSGS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks
- The method provides principled uncertainty quantification, a feature absent in standard RED approaches
- Theoretical guarantees ensure convergence of the sampler and quantify bias introduced by the data augmentation scheme

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by embedding a denoising neural network within a Bayesian inference framework, effectively turning the denoiser into a prior distribution over images. The Langevin-within-Split Gibbs sampler enables efficient exploration of the posterior distribution by combining exact sampling from some conditionals with approximate sampling via Langevin dynamics for others. The asymptotically exact data augmentation scheme simplifies the sampling process by reducing the need for direct sampling from complex conditionals, making the approach scalable to high-dimensional imaging problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian inference for inverse problems**: Provides a probabilistic framework to incorporate prior knowledge and quantify uncertainty; quick check: derive posterior distribution for linear inverse problem with Gaussian noise.
- **Regularization-by-denoising (RED)**: Uses denoisers as implicit regularizers in inverse problems; quick check: show how RED penalty relates to gradient of denoising function.
- **Gibbs sampling and data augmentation**: Enables sampling from complex joint distributions by alternating conditional sampling; quick check: implement Gibbs sampler for a simple hierarchical model.
- **Langevin Monte Carlo**: Uses gradient information to propose moves in MCMC sampling; quick check: compare Langevin updates to standard Metropolis-Hastings proposals.
- **Asymptotically exact data augmentation**: Simplifies sampling by introducing auxiliary variables that become exact in the limit; quick check: verify convergence of augmented scheme to true posterior.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Image reconstruction problem -> Bayesian model with denoiser-based prior -> Langevin-within-Split Gibbs sampler -> Posterior samples + uncertainty estimates

**Critical Path:**
1. Define forward model and noise model for inverse problem
2. Construct denoiser-based prior using trained neural network
3. Implement LwSGS algorithm with Langevin step for prior conditional
4. Run sampler to obtain posterior samples
5. Compute point estimates and uncertainty metrics from samples

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Using pre-trained denoisers enables data-driven regularization but introduces dependency on denoiser quality and potential mismatch with true noise distribution
- Langevin-within-Split Gibbs allows efficient sampling but requires careful tuning of step size and burn-in period
- Asymptotic exactness of data augmentation ensures theoretical guarantees but may require many iterations for practical accuracy

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor reconstruction quality if denoiser is mismatched to true noise or data distribution
- Slow mixing or high autocorrelation in samples if Langevin step size is poorly tuned
- Underestimated uncertainties if data augmentation approximation is not sufficiently accurate

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement LwSGS on a simple linear inverse problem with known solution and compare posterior samples to ground truth
2. Test the effect of Langevin step size on sample quality and mixing for a toy problem
3. Validate uncertainty quantification by checking calibration of credible intervals on synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided context.

## Limitations
- Validation primarily on synthetic or benchmark datasets; limited assessment on real-world noisy or complex imaging scenarios
- Computational efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional problems relative to deep learning alternatives not fully explored
- Dependence on pre-trained denoisers introduces potential biases and sensitivity to denoiser mismatch

## Confidence
- **Theoretical claims**: High (rigorous convergence analysis and bias quantification provided)
- **Experimental claims**: Medium (promising results but constrained by scope of tested scenarios)
- **Practical applicability and scalability**: Low (pending further validation on diverse, real-world problems)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LwSGS on real-world imaging datasets with complex noise structures, comparing uncertainty estimates to ground truth
2. Benchmark computational efficiency and scalability of LwSGS against deep learning-based regularization methods on large-scale inverse problems
3. Assess the robustness of LwSGS to denoiser mismatch by testing with denoisers trained under different noise assumptions or on different data distributions
