# Towards measuring fairness in speech recognition: Fair-Speech dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12734
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12734
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Fair-Speech dataset reveals statistically significant WER gaps across demographic groups, with largest disparities for Black or African American speakers and non-native English speakers, even after semi-supervised training.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Fair-Speech, a new dataset with approximately 26.5K utterances from 593 U.S. speakers, designed to evaluate ASR fairness across demographic groups including age, gender, ethnicity, geographic variation, and native language. Speakers self-reported demographic information and recorded voice commands in response to natural prompts. The authors provide ASR baselines using models trained on transcribed and untranscribed social media videos, and open-source models like Whisper. Results show statistically significant WER gaps across all demographic categories, with the largest disparities observed for Black or African American speakers and non-native English speakers. Even with large-scale training data, significant fairness gaps remain, highlighting the need for improved modeling techniques.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a new dataset collected with natural prompts to capture authentic speech patterns, annotated with demographic labels from speaker self-identification. Multiple ASR models are evaluated, including RNN-T models trained on transcribed and semi-supervised video data, and Whisper models. WER is computed across demographic subgroups, and mixed-effects Poisson regression is used to assess statistical significance while controlling for speaker-level variability. The analysis reveals persistent WER gaps even after semi-supervised training, suggesting that data quantity alone is insufficient for fairness.

## Key Results
- Statistically significant WER gaps across all demographic categories (age, gender, ethnicity, geographic variation, native language)
- Largest disparities observed for Black or African American speakers and non-native English speakers
- Semi-supervised training reduces but does not eliminate fairness gaps, indicating need for new modeling techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speaker self-identification and natural recording prompts improve demographic representation over read speech.
- Mechanism: Allowing participants to speak naturally in response to open-ended prompts captures more authentic speech patterns, including disfluencies and colloquial pronunciation, which better reflect real-world usage and thus provide a fairer evaluation set.
- Core assumption: Participants will naturally produce speech closer to their conversational style when responding to open prompts versus reading scripted text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Providing broad prompts to guide the speakers is better than simply asking participants to read text prompts, since that tends to make the audios sound less natural: people would make different kinds of pauses than in natural speech and entities might also not be pronounced properly, if the participants are not familiar with them."
  - [corpus] Weak: No explicit validation that naturalness was maintained across demographics; only stated as motivation.
- Break condition: If prompts are not sufficiently open-ended or if participants default to reading, naturalness advantage disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model-based mixed-effects Poisson regression accounts for speaker-level variability and confounding factors when measuring WER gaps.
- Mechanism: The regression includes speaker-level random effects to capture individual variation, allowing statistical significance of demographic subgroup differences to be tested while controlling for speaker-specific confounds.
- Core assumption: Speaker identity is the primary source of within-group variation and can be modeled as a random effect.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We apply the model-based approach, where we fit a mixed-effects Poisson regression with the demographic group we focus on (age, gender etc.) as the fixed effect and speaker label as a random effect."
  - [section] "This helps by taking into account nuisance factors, unobserved heterogeneity across speakers and helps tracing the source of WER gaps between different sub-groups."
  - [corpus] Weak: No validation that this approach consistently improves inference over simpler methods.
- Break condition: If speaker effects are negligible or highly correlated with subgroup membership, the model may misattribute variance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large-scale semi-supervised training reduces demographic WER gaps, but does not eliminate them.
- Mechanism: Adding pseudo-labeled data from large teacher models diversifies the training distribution, which can reduce bias toward majority accents and speech patterns.
- Core assumption: The teacher models and pseudo-labels adequately cover underrepresented demographic subgroups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Adding more data in training can significantly improve the performance of the model, such as when semi-supervised data was added for the video models. Interestingly however, for geographic variation, even though the WER improves with more data, the relative gap becomes wider."
  - [corpus] Weak: No quantitative comparison of subgroup coverage in semi-supervised data.
- Break condition: If teacher models themselves are biased, or pseudo-labels are noisy for minority subgroups, gaps may persist or widen.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fairness metrics in ML
  - Why needed here: Evaluating ASR fairness requires understanding metrics like WER, relative gaps, and statistical significance.
  - Quick check question: What does a 43% relative WER gap mean in practical terms for a voice assistant user?

- Concept: Mixed-effects models
  - Why needed here: The paper uses mixed-effects Poisson regression to isolate demographic effects while controlling for speaker variability.
  - Quick check question: How does a random effect for speaker differ from a fixed effect for age in the regression?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning in ASR
  - Why needed here: The paper compares supervised vs. semi-supervised models; understanding how pseudo-labels are generated is key to interpreting fairness results.
  - Quick check question: What risks arise if teacher models underrepresent minority accents in pseudo-label generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Dataset collection -> annotation pipeline -> demographic tagging -> WER evaluation -> mixed-effects analysis -> baseline model training
  Models: supervised RNN-T (50M params), semi-supervised RNN-T (290M params), Whisper small/large
  Data: 26.5K utterances, 593 speakers, 7 demographic categories

- Critical path:
  1. Ensure audio quality and transcription accuracy
  2. Validate demographic labels for consistency
  3. Run WER evaluation across models
  4. Apply mixed-effects analysis for significance
  5. Compare supervised vs. semi-supervised baselines

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Natural prompts vs. controlled prompts (authenticity vs. consistency)
  - Speaker-level random effects vs. simpler subgroup comparisons (nuisance control vs. interpretability)
  - Large model size vs. computational cost (accuracy vs. deployment)

- Failure signatures:
  - High WER variance within demographic subgroups suggests insufficient speaker coverage
  - Persistent gaps after semi-supervised training indicate bias in teacher models or pseudo-labels
  - Non-significant mixed-effects results may mean speaker variability overwhelms demographic effects

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate WER baseline using Whisper large-v2 on the Fair-Speech test set; verify reported numbers.
  2. Run mixed-effects Poisson regression on WER by age; confirm statistically significant gap between 18-22 and 31-45 groups.
  3. Compare WER distributions across ethnicity subgroups using violin plots; identify minority subgroups with highest variance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do large-scale ASR models trained on millions of hours of data still exhibit significant fairness gaps across demographic subgroups, and what specific modeling techniques could address this?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Data might not be enough to achieve a fair model. All the models shown here were trained on more than 1 million hours of data. However, they exhibit significant gaps across each of the demographic sub-groups. Thus, new modeling techniques are needed to focus on improving the performance for all people."
- Why unresolved: Despite extensive training data, fairness gaps persist, suggesting that data quantity alone is insufficient. The paper calls for new modeling techniques but does not specify what these might be.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of ASR models using novel techniques specifically designed to address fairness gaps, demonstrating improved performance across demographic subgroups compared to baseline models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of geographic and linguistic variation on ASR performance, and how can models be optimized to handle these variations more effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows statistically significant WER gaps for geographic variation (low vs. medium vs. affluent) and linguistic variation (native vs. non-native English speakers). The paper notes that even with semi-supervised data, gaps remain.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies these gaps but does not explore the underlying causes or propose solutions for optimizing model performance across these variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of model performance across geographic and linguistic variations, identifying specific factors contributing to gaps, and testing interventions to improve performance for underrepresented groups.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does speaker variability and confounding factors influence WER gaps, and what methods can be used to isolate and address these effects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that speaker variability, sample size, and confounding factors complicate the interpretation of WER gaps. It uses a model-based approach with mixed-effects Poisson regression to account for these factors.
- Why unresolved: While the paper applies a model-based approach to measure fairness, it does not fully explore how to address the underlying causes of variability and confounding factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of more sophisticated methods to isolate the effects of speaker variability and confounding factors, and testing interventions to reduce their impact on WER gaps.

## Limitations

- Dataset representativeness may be limited relative to full U.S. population distribution, particularly for geographic and ethnic diversity
- Model bias sources not fully characterized; residual gaps may stem from teacher model bias or pseudo-label quality issues
- Statistical assumptions of mixed-effects Poisson regression may lead to underestimated significance if demographic factors correlate strongly with speaker identity

## Confidence

- High confidence: The existence of measurable WER gaps across demographic subgroups in ASR; the general finding that larger training data reduces but doesn't eliminate fairness gaps
- Medium confidence: The specific magnitude of WER gaps reported; the claim that natural prompts produce more authentic speech than read prompts (lacks direct validation)
- Low confidence: The assertion that speaker-level random effects fully control for confounding; the effectiveness of the current prompts in capturing all relevant speech variation

## Next Checks

1. External demographic validation: Compare the Fair-Speech speaker demographics against U.S. Census data for the target age, gender, and ethnicity groups to quantify representativeness gaps
2. Prompt naturalness verification: Conduct a controlled study comparing WER distributions between utterances from natural prompts versus read prompts within the same demographic groups to empirically verify the naturalness advantage
3. Teacher model bias audit: Analyze the accent and dialect distribution in the pseudo-labeled semi-supervised data to determine if certain demographic subgroups are systematically underrepresented or mislabeled
