# From cart to truck: meaning shift through words in English in the last two centuries

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16209
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Diachronic word embeddings reveal semantic shifts in English from 1800-2000 across energy, transport, entertainment, and computing domains

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates semantic shifts in English words from 1800-2000 using diachronic word embeddings trained via word2vec skipgram. The method aligns embeddings across decades using orthogonal Procrustes and finds temporally similar words for given concepts. Results show shifts in energy (e.g., "steam" → "diesel"), transport (e.g., "cart" → "truck"), entertainment (e.g., "theater" → "television"), and computing (e.g., "mathematical" → "computer") domains. Some shifts reflect technological and societal changes, but results require expert interpretation to account for historical biases. The study demonstrates onomasiology's value in revealing past conceptual evolution but highlights limitations in representativeness and potential bias.

## Method Summary
The study employs diachronic word embeddings trained using word2vec skipgram on historical English corpora spanning 1800-2000. Temporal alignment is achieved through orthogonal Procrustes transformation, which finds the optimal linear mapping between embedding spaces of consecutive decades. For each concept, the method identifies temporally similar words across time periods, revealing semantic evolution patterns. The approach leverages onomasiology - the study of how concepts are named - to trace how technological and societal changes manifest in vocabulary evolution.

## Key Results
- Energy domain: "steam" shifts to "diesel" reflecting technological transitions
- Transport domain: "cart" evolves to "truck" showing changes in transportation technology
- Entertainment domain: "theater" shifts to "television" capturing media evolution
- Computing domain: "mathematical" transforms to "computer" indicating conceptual reframing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the distributional hypothesis that words appearing in similar contexts develop similar meanings. By training embeddings on decade-specific corpora and aligning them through Procrustes transformation, the approach captures how semantic neighborhoods evolve over time. The skipgram architecture learns to predict context words, creating dense representations that encode meaning. When aligned across time, these representations reveal how concepts migrate semantically as technology and society change.

## Foundational Learning
- Diachronic word embeddings: Needed to capture temporal semantic evolution; quick check: verify decade-specific training stability
- Orthogonal Procrustes alignment: Required for consistent cross-time comparison; quick check: measure alignment quality metrics
- Distributional semantics: Fundamental to embedding-based meaning representation; quick check: test on known semantic relationships
- Onomasiology: Provides theoretical framework for studying concept naming; quick check: validate findings against historical linguistics
- Skipgram architecture: Enables efficient context-based learning; quick check: compare with CBOW for stability
- Corpus representativeness: Critical for avoiding bias in semantic shifts; quick check: analyze corpus composition changes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Historical corpora -> Word2Vec skipgram -> Decade embeddings -> Procrustes alignment -> Temporal similarity search

Critical path: Training embeddings for each decade -> Aligning embedding spaces -> Computing temporal similarities -> Interpreting semantic shifts

Design tradeoffs: The study uses linear Procrustes alignment for computational efficiency but this may miss non-linear semantic evolution patterns. Skipgram was chosen over CBOW for better handling of rare words, important for historical texts.

Failure signatures: Unstable embeddings across decades suggest corpus composition changes or insufficient training data. Poor Procrustes alignment indicates non-linear semantic evolution. Random temporal similarities suggest model failure or corpus bias.

First experiments:
1. Train decade-specific embeddings on a controlled subset to test stability
2. Apply alignment to synthetic semantic shifts to validate detection capability
3. Compare results with contemporary word frequency changes to separate meaning from usage shifts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study acknowledges that computational detection of semantic shifts requires expert interpretation to account for historical biases. The representativeness of the underlying corpus and the absence of controls for selection bias are significant limitations not fully addressed. The paper does not provide details on corpus composition, size, or representativeness across different domains.

## Limitations
- Corpus composition and representativeness across domains are not detailed, raising concerns about sampling bias
- Linear Procrustes alignment may not capture complex semantic evolution patterns
- Alternative explanations such as changing vocabulary usage cannot be ruled out without further validation
- Computational approach alone may not be sufficient for accurate meaning shift detection

## Confidence
High confidence: The technical methodology using word2vec skipgram and Procrustes alignment is standard and well-documented in diachronic linguistics research.

Medium confidence: The identified semantic shifts align with expected technological and societal changes, though alternative explanations exist.

Low confidence: The representativeness of the underlying corpus and the absence of controls for selection bias are significant limitations not fully addressed.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis by training models on multiple historical corpus subsets to assess stability of identified semantic shifts
2. Compare results against established historical lexical databases to validate computational findings with expert-curated data
3. Implement bias detection metrics to quantify potential sampling effects from corpus composition changes over time
