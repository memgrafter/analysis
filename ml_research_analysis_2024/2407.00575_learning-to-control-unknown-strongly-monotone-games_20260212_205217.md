# Learning to Control Unknown Strongly Monotone Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.00575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00575
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Online learning algorithm that converges to Nash equilibria satisfying linear constraints without knowing players' reward functions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an online learning algorithm for controlling unknown strongly monotone games where a manager aims to steer the game to a Nash equilibrium that satisfies target linear constraints. The manager does not know the players' reward functions or action sets but can observe constraint violations and adjust controlled coefficients. The algorithm uses a two-time-scale stochastic approximation approach where players update actions via stochastic gradient ascent while the manager adjusts coefficients based on observed violations. The method is shown to converge with probability 1 to Nash equilibria satisfying the target constraints, with a mean square error rate of near-O(t^(-1/4)) for the constraint violation.

## Method Summary
The method implements a two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm where players update their actions using stochastic gradient ascent based on current controlled coefficients in the faster time-scale, while the manager adjusts these coefficients in the slower time-scale based on observed constraint violations. Players compute controlled coefficients βn = A⊺nα from the manager's broadcast and update actions using stochastic gradients. The manager observes Axt - ℓ* and updates α using a gradient-like rule. The algorithm maintains player privacy by only observing aggregate constraint violations, not individual actions or reward functions.

## Key Results
- Convergence with probability 1 to the set of Nash equilibria satisfying target linear constraints
- Mean square error rate of near-O(t^(-1/4)) for the linear constraint violation
- Algorithm maintains player privacy by only observing aggregate constraint violations
- Robust against strategic manipulation by small groups of players

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm ensures convergence to Nash equilibria satisfying target linear constraints. In the faster time-scale, players update actions via stochastic gradient ascent to approach the current Nash equilibrium. In the slower time-scale, the manager adjusts α based on observed constraint violation. This iterative process creates contraction-like behavior despite the non-expansive nature of mapping g(α), leading to convergence to Nopt. This requires the game to be strongly monotone and constraint violations to be observable.

### Mechanism 2
The non-expansiveness of the mapping g(α) = α + γ(Ax*(α) - ℓ*) is crucial for convergence analysis. The mapping is shown to be non-expansive, meaning distance between any two points under g is not increased. This property enables using Krasnosel'skiı–Mann algorithm techniques to analyze convergence of manager's updates to fixed points of g, corresponding to Nopt. This requires Lipschitz continuity of the Nash equilibrium mapping and cocoercivity of the weighted load vector.

### Mechanism 3
The near-O(t^(-1/4)) convergence rate for linear constraint violation is achieved by carefully balancing step sizes ηt and εt. Step sizes are chosen such that ηt is square-summable but not summable, and εt satisfies lim t→∞ εt²/ηt³ = 0. This ensures faster time-scale (player updates) converges faster than slower time-scale (manager updates), yielding desired rate. This requires step sizes satisfying conditions in Assumption 5 and game satisfying strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity assumptions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Strong monotonicity of games**: Ensures existence of unique Nash equilibrium for each set of controlled coefficients and enables variational inequality techniques in convergence analysis. Quick check: What is the definition of a strongly monotone game, and how does it differ from a monotone game?

- **Two-time-scale stochastic approximation**: Allows players to update actions at faster rate than manager updates controlled coefficients, enabling convergence to desired Nash equilibrium. Quick check: What are key differences between single-time-scale and two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms?

- **Non-expansive mappings and Krasnosel'skiı–Mann algorithm**: Non-expansiveness of mapping g(α) is crucial for convergence analysis, and Krasnosel'skiı–Mann algorithm provides framework for analyzing convergence of fixed-point iterations with non-expansive mappings. Quick check: What is definition of a non-expansive mapping, and how does Krasnosel'skiı–Mann algorithm use this property to ensure convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Manager -> Players (broadcast α) -> Manager (feedback Axt - ℓ*)
- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize α0 and xn,0 for all players. 2) For each time step t: a) Manager observes Axt-1 - ℓ*. b) Each player computes βn,t-1 = A⊺nαt-1 and updates action using stochastic gradient ascent. c) Manager updates αt using gradient-like update. d) Manager broadcasts αt to players. 3) Repeat until convergence.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Privacy vs. convergence speed (algorithm maintains privacy but may slow convergence); convergence rate vs. step size (depends on choice of ηt and εt); computational complexity (requires computing stochastic gradients and projections).
- **Failure signatures**: Divergence (incorrect step sizes or unsatisfied assumptions); slow convergence (small step sizes or non-strongly monotone game); persistent constraint violation (ineffective manager updates or non-convergent player actions).
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Verify convergence on small-scale example with known Nash equilibria and linear constraints. 2) Test sensitivity of convergence rate to choice of step sizes ηt and εt. 3) Evaluate performance on larger-scale problem like resource allocation game with many players and resources.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the algorithm perform under strategic manipulation by a subset of players? Would it still converge to satisfying linear constraints? The paper conjectures robustness against strategic manipulation by multiple players but provides no formal proof. Evidence needed: Formal proof showing convergence under strategic manipulation or empirical evidence from simulations with strategic players.

### Open Question 2
Can the algorithm be extended to handle nonlinear constraints at Nash equilibria? The paper focuses on linear constraints and does not explore nonlinear constraints. Evidence needed: Modified algorithm handling nonlinear constraints with convergence guarantees and rate analysis.

### Open Question 3
How does the convergence rate change with different step-size sequences {ηt} and {εt}? The paper provides specific rate under certain assumptions but doesn't explore other sequences. Evidence needed: Comprehensive analysis of convergence rate for different step-size sequences with theoretical bounds and empirical results.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely heavily on strong monotonicity assumption which may limit applicability to real-world problems
- Convergence rate of near-O(t^(-1/4)) derived under ideal conditions and may vary with problem instance and step size choice
- Algorithm design specifically for linear constraints with no theoretical guarantees for nonlinear constraints

## Confidence
- High: Convergence to set of NE satisfying target linear constraints with probability 1 (Theorem 1)
- Medium: Mean square error rate of near-O(t^(-1/4)) for linear constraint violation (Theorem 2)
- Low: Applicability to non-strongly monotone games or games with non-linear constraints

## Next Checks
1. Implement the algorithm on a suite of test problems with known Nash equilibria and linear constraints to verify theoretical convergence guarantees and assess practical performance
2. Investigate sensitivity of convergence rate to choice of step sizes and problem parameters to provide guidelines for tuning the algorithm
3. Explore modifications to handle non-strongly monotone games or games with non-linear constraints, which are more common in practice
