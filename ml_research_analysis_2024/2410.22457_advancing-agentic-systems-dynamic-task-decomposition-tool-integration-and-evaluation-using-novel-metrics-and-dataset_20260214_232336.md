# Advancing Agentic Systems: Dynamic Task Decomposition, Tool Integration and Evaluation using Novel Metrics and Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22457
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22457
- Authors: Adrian Garret Gabriel; Alaa Alameer Ahmad; Shankar Kumar Jeyakumar
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Framework for dynamic task decomposition, tool integration, and autonomous task execution with novel evaluation metrics and AsyncHow-based dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an advanced agentic framework designed to handle complex, multi-step tasks through dynamic task decomposition and intelligent tool integration. The framework generates task graphs in real-time, selects appropriate tools using semantic filtering, and executes tasks asynchronously while adapting to changing requirements. A key innovation is the introduction of novel evaluation metrics including Node F1 Score, Structural Similarity Index (SSI), and Tool F1 Score, which provide more comprehensive assessment of agentic system performance than traditional metrics.

The framework demonstrates significant improvements in system responsiveness and scalability for complex multi-step tasks, particularly in scenarios requiring parallel execution of independent tasks. The SSI metric emerges as the most significant predictor of performance in sequential tasks, while Tool F1 Score proves essential for parallel tasks, highlighting the need for balanced evaluation methods that capture both structural and operational aspects of agentic behavior.

## Method Summary
The method involves developing an agentic framework with three main components: an Orchestrator that dynamically generates task graphs from user queries, a ToolManager that performs semantic-based tool filtering and selection, and an Executor that handles parallel/sequential task execution. The framework introduces novel evaluation metrics (Node F1 Score, SSI, Tool F1 Score) and utilizes a specialized AsyncHow-based dataset for testing. The approach focuses on real-time adaptation to task changes, efficient tool selection through semantic similarity matching, and comprehensive performance evaluation using the proposed metrics.

## Key Results
- SSI is the most significant predictor of performance in sequential tasks (r = 0.470, p < 0.001)
- Tool F1 Score is essential for parallel tasks, capturing tool selection accuracy
- Novel metrics provide more comprehensive evaluation than traditional precision/recall metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Dynamic task graph generation improves system responsiveness and scalability for complex multi-step tasks.
- **Mechanism**: The Orchestrator analyzes user queries and produces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents tasks and their dependencies. This allows parallel execution of independent tasks while respecting sequential constraints.
- **Core assumption**: LLM-generated task graphs accurately capture task dependencies and can be executed without cyclic dependencies.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "asynchronous and dynamic task graph decomposition significantly improves system responsiveness and scalability"
  - [section 3] "Asynchronous task graph decomposition, as explored by recent work on graph-enhanced LLMs, allows parallel task execution, enabling real-time adaptation to task changes and dependencies"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors discuss agentic systems generally but don't specifically address dynamic task graph generation mechanisms
- **Break condition**: If the LLM produces cyclic dependencies or incorrectly identifies task relationships, the DAG execution will fail or produce incorrect results.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Task-aware semantic tool filtering reduces latency and improves tool selection accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: The ToolManager uses FAISS-based semantic similarity between task descriptions and tool embeddings to filter relevant tools for each task, rather than passing the entire tool cache to the LLM.
- **Core assumption**: Semantic embeddings accurately capture the functional relationship between tasks and tools.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3] "This semantic filtering enhances the efficiency and accuracy of task execution by reducing unnecessary processing overhead"
  - [section 4.2] "These formulas are applicable for tool identification, node and edge matching, as accurate identification is crucial for the successful decomposition and execution of tasks by the agent"
  - [corpus] Moderate - neighbors mention tool integration but don't specifically address semantic filtering mechanisms
- **Break condition**: If semantic embeddings don't capture functional similarity accurately, the tool filtering will miss relevant tools or include irrelevant ones.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The Structural Similarity Index (SSI) is the most significant predictor of performance in sequential tasks.
- **Mechanism**: SSI combines node label similarity and edge F1 score to provide a comprehensive evaluation of task graph structural fidelity, capturing both node and edge similarities.
- **Core assumption**: Structural fidelity of task graphs correlates strongly with task execution success.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) emerged as the most significant predictor of performance in sequential tasks"
  - [section 5] "The Structural Similarity Index (SSI) emerged as the most significant predictor of Answer Score, with a strong positive correlation (r = 0.470, p < 0.001)"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss evaluation metrics but don't specifically validate SSI's predictive power
- **Break condition**: If task execution success depends more on tool selection or other factors than structural fidelity, SSI will not be a reliable predictor.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and graph theory fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on DAG-based task decomposition and execution
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a DAG and a general graph, and why is acyclicity important for task execution?

- **Concept**: Semantic similarity and embedding techniques
  - Why needed here: Tool filtering and task matching rely on semantic similarity between descriptions
  - Quick check question: How does FAISS enable efficient similarity search in high-dimensional embedding spaces?

- **Concept**: Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1 score, and their application to graph structures
  - Why needed here: The framework introduces novel metrics that extend traditional precision/recall to task graphs and tool selection
  - Quick check question: How would you calculate F1 score for edge matching in a task graph, and what constitutes a true positive edge?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Orchestrator → Task Graph → Delegator → Agents + Tools → Executor → Final Response
- **Critical path**: User Query → Orchestrator → Task Graph Generation → Tool Selection → Task Execution → Final Response
  - Bottlenecks typically occur in LLM processing time for task graph generation and tool selection
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Fine-grained vs coarse-grained task decomposition: Fine-grained enables more parallelism but increases overhead; coarse-grained reduces overhead but limits parallelism
  - Sequential vs parallel execution: Sequential ensures dependency satisfaction but reduces throughput; parallel maximizes efficiency but requires careful dependency management
  - Tool filtering comprehensiveness vs latency: More comprehensive filtering improves accuracy but increases latency
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Cyclic dependencies in task graphs indicate Orchestrator LLM prompt engineering issues
  - Missing or incorrect tools suggest problems with ToolManager semantic filtering or embedding quality
  - Poor answer quality despite high SSI may indicate disconnect between structural fidelity and task completion requirements
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test Orchestrator with simple linear task queries to verify basic DAG generation without dependencies
  2. Test ToolManager with known task-tool pairs to verify semantic filtering accuracy
  3. Test Executor with independent parallel tasks to verify parallel execution capabilities without dependency conflicts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the agentic framework handle real-time tool availability changes and what is the impact on task graph execution performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "real-time changes in task requirements or tool availability" as a feature of the framework and discusses "task-aware semantic tool filtering" for dynamic tool selection.
- Why unresolved: While the framework mentions dynamic tool selection and adaptation to real-time changes, the paper doesn't provide specific performance metrics or empirical data on how quickly the system can adapt to tool availability changes during execution or the impact on overall task completion time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing task completion times with and without dynamic tool adaptation, metrics on system responsiveness to tool availability changes, and comparison of performance with static vs dynamic tool selection in real-time scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational overhead of the Graph Edit Distance (GED) metric in large-scale task graphs and how does it affect real-time evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states "Calculating Graph Edit Distance (GED) is computationally intensive, especially for large graphs" as a limitation in Section 6.
- Why unresolved: While the limitation is acknowledged, the paper doesn't provide specific computational complexity analysis, benchmarks of GED calculation times for different graph sizes, or discuss alternative efficient methods for structural comparison.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed computational complexity analysis of GED calculation, empirical benchmarks showing GED computation times across different graph sizes, and comparison with alternative structural similarity metrics in terms of accuracy vs computational cost.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the agentic framework perform in multi-agent collaborative environments and what are the limitations of current single-agent approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies "lack of support for multi-agent communication" as a limitation in Section 6, stating the system is "only suited for single-agent environments or cases where agents operate independently."
- Why unresolved: The current framework is designed for single-agent operation, and while multi-agent communication is mentioned as future work, there's no empirical data on how the framework would perform or what challenges would arise in multi-agent scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and testing of multi-agent version of the framework, metrics on collaborative task completion vs single-agent performance, analysis of communication overhead and coordination challenges in multi-agent settings.

## Limitations

- **Limited multi-agent support**: The framework is designed for single-agent environments and lacks support for multi-agent communication, reducing its effectiveness in collaborative settings.
- **Dataset imbalance sensitivity**: Precision, Recall, and F1 Score metrics are sensitive to dataset imbalances, potentially leading to skewed results when expected tools are very few or many.
- **Computational overhead of GED**: Graph Edit Distance calculation is computationally intensive, especially for large graphs, which may affect real-time evaluation performance.

## Confidence

- **Medium confidence**: SSI metric's predictive power, as results are based on a specialized dataset that may not generalize to all task types
- **Medium confidence**: Tool F1 Score's effectiveness for parallel tasks, as evaluation didn't extensively test highly complex parallel scenarios
- **Low confidence**: Framework's scalability claims, as the paper doesn't provide comprehensive testing across different system sizes or load conditions

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset generalization test**: Evaluate the framework using diverse real-world datasets beyond AsyncHow to assess metric robustness across different task domains and query types.

2. **Scalability benchmark**: Test the system with varying numbers of concurrent tasks and tools to identify performance bottlenecks and verify claims about parallel execution efficiency.

3. **Multi-agent extension validation**: Implement a basic multi-agent communication layer and test whether the current metrics and framework components adequately capture performance in collaborative agent scenarios.
