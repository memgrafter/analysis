core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of incorporating acoustic information
  into multi-modal dialogue systems, which is crucial for understanding human communication
  nuances and avoiding misinterpretations of speakers' intentions. The proposed method,
  PerceptiveAgent, is an empathetic multi-modal dialogue system that perceives acoustic
  information from input speech and generates empathetic responses based on speaking
  styles described in natural language.
