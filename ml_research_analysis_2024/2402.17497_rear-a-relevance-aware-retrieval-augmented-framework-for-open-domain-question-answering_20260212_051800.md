# REAR: A Relevance-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17497
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17497
- Reference count: 20
- REAR significantly outperforms competitive RAG approaches on open-domain QA benchmarks without requiring GPT API access

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of unreliable knowledge utilization in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where large language models (LLMs) struggle to accurately assess the relevance of retrieved documents. The proposed REAR framework introduces a novel architecture that explicitly incorporates an assessment module within LLMs to precisely evaluate document relevance and guide knowledge utilization. The method combines bi-granularity relevance fusion (integrating coarse and fine-grained supervision) and noise-resistant training to enhance relevance discrimination and adaptive knowledge usage. Experiments on four open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that REAR significantly outperforms competitive RAG approaches, achieving substantial improvements in exact match and F1 scores. The framework also shows strong generalization capabilities across different datasets and robustness to irrelevant documents.

## Method Summary
REAR introduces a novel RAG architecture that incorporates an explicit assessment module within LLMs to precisely evaluate document relevance. The framework uses bi-granularity relevance fusion, combining coarse binary labels with fine-grained relevance scores derived from estimated relevance. Noise-resistant training is implemented through negative sampling using a refined SimANS method, allowing the LLM to learn to handle irrelevant documents effectively. The approach is trained end-to-end and achieves strong performance across multiple open-domain QA benchmarks without requiring access to GPT APIs.

## Key Results
- REAR significantly outperforms competitive RAG approaches on four open-domain QA benchmarks
- The framework achieves substantial improvements in exact match and F1 scores
- REAR demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different datasets and robustness to irrelevant documents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Incorporating an explicit assessment module within LLMs enables precise evaluation of document relevance, reducing the impact of irrelevant documents on generation.
- **Mechanism**: The assessment module captures relevance signals from query-document pairs and feeds them back to guide the generation process, preventing distraction from irrelevant external knowledge.
- **Core assumption**: Relevance signals can be effectively extracted and utilized by the LLM to improve generation quality.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "We develop a novel architecture for LLM-based RAG systems, by incorporating a specially designed assessment module that precisely assesses the relevance of retrieved documents."
  - [section 4.1.1]: "Drawing from the success of LLM-based decoder in achieving precise relevance assessment (Ma et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023), we first map the input query-document pair into the relevance embedding vrel by the LLM"
- **Break condition**: If the assessment module fails to accurately capture relevance signals, the generation process may still be influenced by irrelevant documents.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Bi-granularity relevance fusion, combining coarse and fine-grained relevance supervision, overcomes the limitations of binary discriminative methods and provides sufficient evidence for solving complex QA tasks.
- **Mechanism**: The fine-grained supervision utilizes estimated relevance scores to derive relevance preference constraints, while the coarse-grained supervision provides binary labels. These two types of supervision are combined to enhance the LLM's relevance discrimination ability.
- **Core assumption**: Combining coarse and fine-grained relevance supervision leads to better performance than using either one alone.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training."
  - [section 4.2.1]: "Bi-granularity relevance fusion strategy further integrates both coarse and fine-grained relevance supervision to overcome the limitations of binary discriminative methods"
- **Break condition**: If the fine-grained relevance scores are not accurately estimated, the bi-granularity relevance fusion may not provide significant improvements.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Noise-resistant training enhances the discrimination ability of the LLM by incorporating negative examples in the training procedure, enabling the LLM to adaptively use external evidence for task solving.
- **Mechanism**: The LLM is trained on a combination of positive and negative examples, where negative examples are irrelevant documents sampled using a refined SimANS method. This training process helps the LLM learn to discern the incorporation of irrelevant documents without being encumbered by extraneous information.
- **Core assumption**: Incorporating negative examples in the training procedure improves the LLM's ability to handle irrelevant documents during inference.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training."
  - [section 4.2.2]: "In addition to improving the capability of identifying relevant documents, we further consider enhancing the discrimination ability when reference documents contain irrelevant content or even noise, such that the LLM can adaptively use external evidence for task solving."
- **Break condition**: If the negative examples are not properly sampled or the LLM fails to learn from them, the noise-resistant training may not be effective.

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: How does the noise-resistant training in REAR help the LLM learn to discern the incorporation of irrelevant documents?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Query -> Document collection -> Assessment module -> Generation module -> Answer

- **Critical path**: Query → Document collection → Assessment module → Generation module → Answer

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Incorporating an explicit assessment module increases model complexity but improves relevance evaluation accuracy.
  - Using bi-granularity relevance fusion requires additional training data and computation but leads to better performance.
  - Noise-resistant training with negative examples may introduce noise but enhances the LLM's robustness to irrelevant documents.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low relevance assessment accuracy: The LLM struggles to accurately evaluate the relevance of retrieved documents.
  - Poor generation quality: The LLM fails to generate accurate answers even when provided with relevant documents.
  - Over-reliance on external knowledge: The LLM excessively relies on retrieved documents, ignoring its own parametric knowledge.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the relevance assessment accuracy of REAR on a held-out test set.
  2. Compare the generation quality of REAR with and without the assessment module.
  3. Assess the impact of bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training on the overall performance of REAR.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dependency on estimated relevance scores for fine-grained supervision, where quality directly affects performance
