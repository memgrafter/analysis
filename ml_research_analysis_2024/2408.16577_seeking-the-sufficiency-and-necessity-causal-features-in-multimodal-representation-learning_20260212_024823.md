core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of extending Probability of
  Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) to multimodal representation learning, where existing
  conditions for PNS estimation (exogeneity and monotonicity) are difficult to satisfy
  due to complex inter-modal interactions. The core method, MPNS, conceptualizes multimodal
  representations as comprising modality-invariant and modality-specific components.

# Seeking the Sufficiency and Necessity Causal Features in Multimodal Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.16577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16577
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MPNS framework improves multimodal emotion recognition accuracy by 7% while enhancing robustness to missing modalities

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of identifying sufficient and necessary causal features in multimodal representation learning. The authors introduce MPNS (Multimodal Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency), a framework that extends PNS estimation to multimodal contexts by decomposing representations into modality-invariant and modality-specific components. The key innovation lies in adapting PNS estimation techniques for complex multimodal interactions, using a combination of direct estimation for invariant features and front-door criterion approaches for modality-specific features.

## Method Summary
The MPNS framework conceptualizes multimodal representations as comprising modality-invariant and modality-specific components. For modality-invariant features, PNS can be directly computed from observational data under monotonicity assumptions. For modality-specific features, the authors derive an alternative estimation approach using the front-door criterion, leveraging the property that different modalities share the same label. The framework formulates optimization objectives that encourage learning high-PNS representations by incorporating PNS-oriented losses alongside the original decomposition model loss, achieved through a complement extractor that learns representations leading to different outcome predictions.

## Key Results
- On synthetic data, MPNS consistently captures higher PNS information compared to baseline methods
- On real-world multimodal emotion recognition tasks (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI), MPNS improves predictive performance across multiple metrics (Acc 7%, Acc 2%, F1 score)
- MPNS enhances robustness under missing modality scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by recognizing that multimodal representations have fundamentally different causal structures. Modality-invariant features, which capture shared information across modalities, can satisfy monotonicity assumptions required for PNS estimation. Modality-specific features, which capture unique information in each modality, require a different approach. By using the front-door criterion for modality-specific features, MPNS can estimate PNS even when direct estimation is impossible due to complex inter-modal interactions. The complement extractor ensures that learned representations capture truly causal features by maximizing differences in outcome predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS): A causal measure quantifying how much a feature is both necessary and sufficient for an outcome. Why needed: Provides a principled way to identify truly causal features rather than merely correlated ones.
- Modality-invariant vs. modality-specific features: Decomposition of multimodal representations into shared and unique components. Why needed: Different causal structures require different estimation approaches.
- Front-door criterion: A causal identification strategy that uses mediating variables to estimate causal effects. Why needed: Enables PNS estimation for modality-specific features where direct estimation fails.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input Modalities -> Decomposition Model -> Modality-Invariant Features + Modality-Specific Features -> PNS Estimation -> Complement Extractor -> Final Representation

Critical path: Decomposition model must first separate features into invariant and specific components before PNS can be computed for each type.

Design tradeoffs: Direct PNS estimation is simpler but requires stronger assumptions; front-door criterion is more flexible but requires careful design of mediating variables.

Failure signatures: If decomposition model fails to properly separate invariant from specific features, PNS estimates will be biased; if complement extractor doesn't maximize outcome prediction differences, learned representations won't capture truly causal features.

3 first experiments:
1. Validate decomposition model separates invariant and specific features on synthetic data with known ground truth
2. Test PNS estimation accuracy on synthetic data where ground truth PNS values are computable
3. Ablation study removing complement extractor to quantify its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions may not hold in realistic multimodal datasets
- The front-door criterion approach relies on the assumption that different modalities share the same label, which could be violated in real-world scenarios with noisy or misaligned data
- Synthetic data experiments may not fully capture the complexity of real multimodal interactions

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: Medium
- Synthetic data results: Medium
- Real-world emotion recognition results: Medium
- Generalizability to other multimodal tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test MPNS on additional multimodal datasets with varying degrees of modality dependence to assess robustness across different data characteristics
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of PNS-oriented losses versus other components of the framework
3. Evaluate performance under controlled interventions that systematically vary the causal relationships between modalities and outcomes to validate the theoretical assumptions
