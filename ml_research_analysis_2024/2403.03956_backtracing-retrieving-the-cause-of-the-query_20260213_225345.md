# Backtracing: Retrieving the Cause of the Query

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03956
- Reference count: 13
- One-line primary result: Traditional IR systems often miss causally relevant context when retrieving text that likely caused user queries

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces backtracing, a novel retrieval task that identifies the text segment most likely to have caused a user query. Unlike traditional information retrieval that focuses on semantic relevance, backtracing aims to find the causally relevant context that triggered a query. The authors formalize three real-world domains: understanding student confusion in lectures, reader curiosity in news articles, and user emotion in conversations. Through comprehensive evaluation of popular retrieval methods including bi-encoders, re-rankers, likelihood-based methods, and ChatGPT, the paper demonstrates that current IR systems struggle with backtracing, achieving modest accuracies that highlight the need for new retrieval approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors created benchmark datasets across three domains (Lecture, News Article, Conversation) with annotated query-cause sentence pairs. They evaluated multiple retrieval methods including random selection, edit distance, BM25, bi-encoder models (sentence-transformers), cross-encoders (re-rankers), and likelihood-based methods using GPT-2, GPT-J, and OPT models. The evaluation used zero-shot settings with top-k accuracy and minimum distance metrics. For likelihood methods, they measured the change in query likelihood with and without context sentences, including an Average Treatment Effect (ATE) variant that measures the causal effect of removing sentences.

## Key Results
- Traditional IR systems often miss causally relevant context, with top-3 accuracy of the best model reaching only 44% on the lecture domain
- Queries and their ground-truth cause sentences exhibit low semantic similarity across domains
- The location of causal sentences varies by domain: beginning for news, end for conversations, and uniform distribution for lectures
- ATE likelihood methods don't significantly outperform simpler likelihood approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Backtracing identifies causally relevant context rather than just semantically similar text
- Mechanism: The task requires retrieving the sentence that most likely provoked a user query, which may differ from the sentence most semantically similar to the query
- Core assumption: Queries arise from specific contextual triggers rather than general topic similarity
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states IR systems miss causally relevant context; section 4.2 shows low semantic similarity between queries and ground truth

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The location of causal sentences varies by domain, affecting retrieval difficulty
- Mechanism: Different domains concentrate causal sentences in different locations (beginning for news, end for conversations, uniform for lectures), requiring domain-specific context windows
- Core assumption: The position of causal information follows predictable patterns within each domain
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.2 shows peak distributions at beginning for news, end for conversations, and uniform for lectures

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ATE likelihood methods don't significantly outperform simpler likelihood approaches for backtracing
- Mechanism: Measuring the causal effect of removing a sentence (ATE) doesn't provide additional benefit over measuring likelihood with/without context
- Core assumption: The difference in query likelihood with and without a sentence effectively captures its causal role
- Evidence anchors: Section 6 shows ATE methods don't significantly improve upon other methods despite theoretical advantages

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information retrieval evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper uses top-k accuracy and minimum distance metrics to evaluate backtracing performance
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between top-1 accuracy and minimum sentence distance from ground truth?

- Concept: Zero-shot evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates models without task-specific training, similar to BEIR benchmark approach
  - Quick check question: How does zero-shot evaluation differ from few-shot or fine-tuning approaches?

- Concept: Causal inference in NLP
  - Why needed here: The paper draws inspiration from treatment effects in causal inference for the ATE likelihood method
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between correlation and causation in the context of query-document relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Corpus loading → sentence tokenization → query pairing → retrieval method selection → top-k accuracy calculation → minimum distance computation → result aggregation
- Critical path: Corpus → Sentence selection → Query matching → Evaluation → Result reporting
- Design tradeoffs: Context window limitations vs. full document processing; semantic similarity vs. causal relevance; single sentence focus vs. multi-sentence context; zero-shot evaluation vs. fine-tuned performance
- Failure signatures: High semantic similarity but low causal relevance (Bi-encoder failures); poor performance on long documents (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k limitations); no improvement from ATE methods despite theoretical advantage; domain-specific performance variations
- First 3 experiments: 1) Compare random baseline vs. BM25 on all three domains to establish baseline performance; 2) Test bi-encoder methods across domains to identify semantic vs. causal relevance issues; 3) Evaluate single-sentence vs. autoregressive likelihood methods to understand context requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of backtracing methods vary across different types of queries (e.g., factual, conceptual, procedural) within the same domain?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates methods across three domains but does not analyze query type variations within each domain
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on overall domain-level performance rather than examining how different query types affect retrieval accuracy
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing query types within each domain and their impact on backtracing performance would provide insights into method strengths and weaknesses for different query characteristics

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can incorporating multimodal information (e.g., visual cues, gestures) improve backtracing performance in lecture and conversation domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that multimodal sources are a limitation of the current approach
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses solely on text-based backtracing and does not explore the potential benefits of incorporating multimodal information
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that incorporate multimodal information and comparing performance to text-only methods would demonstrate the impact of multimodal cues on backtracing accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do backtracing methods perform on long-form content (e.g., entire courses, lengthy articles) compared to shorter segments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that lecture transcripts are divided into chunks due to context window limitations, suggesting challenges with long-form content
- Why unresolved: The current study uses shorter segments of longer texts, but does not evaluate backtracing performance on entire long-form content
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating backtracing methods on complete long-form content and comparing performance to segmented approaches would reveal the impact of content length on retrieval accuracy

## Limitations

- Evaluation constrained to zero-shot settings, which may not reflect fine-tuned model performance
- Causal assumptions underlying ATE likelihood method remain unverified
- Domain-specific performance variations suggest need for tailored rather than universal solutions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Traditional IR systems miss causally relevant context (supported by consistent low performance across domains)
- **Medium confidence**: Semantic similarity doesn't guarantee causal relevance (based on low semantic similarity between queries and ground truth, but correlation vs. causation remains unclear)
- **Low confidence**: ATE likelihood methods are ineffective (limited by lack of comparison with properly implemented causal inference techniques)

## Next Checks

1. **Causal validation**: Test whether removing the retrieved sentence actually reduces the likelihood of the query being asked, providing empirical validation of the causal assumptions
2. **Fine-tuning evaluation**: Assess whether backtracing-specific fine-tuning improves performance beyond zero-shot results, particularly for bi-encoder methods
3. **Human evaluation**: Conduct qualitative analysis of model predictions to understand systematic errors and identify whether failures are due to semantic vs. causal relevance mismatches or other factors
