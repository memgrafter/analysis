# DeepSN: A Sheaf Neural Framework for Influence Maximization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12416
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12416
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: DeepSN achieves up to 18.6% improvement in influence spread for non-progressive diffusion models (SIS) compared to baseline methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes DeepSN, a sheaf neural network framework for influence maximization in social networks. The key innovation is modeling influence diffusion as a sheaf diffusion-reaction process that captures both the spread of information and individual vertex dynamics. By using learnable sheaf coefficients to capture network connectivity and reaction operators to model complex diffusion patterns, DeepSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for non-progressive diffusion models like SIS. The framework employs a subgraph-based optimization technique to efficiently identify the optimal seed set, reducing the combinatorial search space while maintaining effectiveness.

## Method Summary
DeepSN introduces a sheaf-based GNN that learns adaptive structural relationships between vertices through learnable sheaf coefficients, moving beyond traditional adjacency-based methods. The framework models influence propagation as a diffusion-reaction process, where diffusion captures information spread and reaction operators (pointwise and coupled dynamics) capture individual vertex state transitions and neighborhood interactions. A subgraph-based optimization technique using the Louvain algorithm partitions the network to reduce search space for seed selection. The method is evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets under IC, LT, and SIS diffusion models, showing superior performance particularly for non-progressive models.

## Key Results
- DeepSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 18.6% in influence spread for SIS diffusion models
- The framework shows improved performance for non-progressive diffusion models compared to progressive ones (IC, LT)
- Subgraph-based optimization reduces computational complexity while maintaining or improving seed set quality
- Learned sheaf coefficients capture dynamic trust relationships better than static adjacency matrices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sheaf coefficients learn adaptive structural relationships between vertices, enabling better modeling of complex diffusion patterns compared to traditional adjacency-based methods.
- Mechanism: Instead of using static adjacency matrices, the framework learns sheaf coefficients that capture dynamic trust relationships between vertices, allowing the model to adapt to varying diffusion patterns.
- Core assumption: Influence diffusion patterns vary across networks and can be learned from data rather than being fixed by network topology.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our framework employs sheaf neural diffusion to learn diverse influence patterns in a data-driven, end-to-end manner"
  - [section]: "Instead of relying on the adjacency matrix for graph connectivity, which fails to capture network dynamics in diffusion models, we learn the connectivity through sheaf coefficients"
- Break condition: If the learned sheaf coefficients fail to capture meaningful structural patterns, or if diffusion patterns are too random to be learned from data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reaction operators introduce non-monotonic, adaptive, and oscillatory behaviors that capture dynamic vertex state transitions in non-progressive diffusion models.
- Mechanism: Two reaction operators (pointwise and coupled dynamics) modify the diffusion process by accounting for internal vertex characteristics and neighborhood interactions, respectively.
- Core assumption: Influence diffusion involves both information spread and individual vertex dynamics that evolve over time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We redefine influence propagation as a sheaf diffusion-reaction process, capturing the intricate dynamics found in real-world diffusion models"
  - [section]: "Reaction operators introduce non-monotonic, adaptive, and oscillatory behaviors, capturing dynamic vertex state transitions"
- Break condition: If the reaction operators overfit to training data or if the added complexity doesn't improve performance on unseen diffusion patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Subgraph-based optimization reduces the combinatorial search space by minimizing overlapping influence between seed vertices.
- Mechanism: The Louvain algorithm partitions the weighted graph (constructed from sheaf coefficients) into subgraphs, then seed selection is optimized within each subgraph rather than across the entire network.
- Core assumption: Vertices in different subgraphs have minimal overlapping influence, allowing independent optimization within subgraphs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose an optimization technique that accounts for overlapping influence between vertices, which helps to reduce the search space"
  - [section]: "We employ a partitioning mechanism to identify subgraphs, which reduces the search space in the process of determining the optimal seed set"
- Break condition: If the partitioning creates subgraphs with significant overlapping influence, or if the subgraph approach fails to find globally optimal seed sets.

## Foundational Learning

- Sheaf theory and cellular sheaves
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical framework for modeling vertex-edge relationships and capturing topological properties of networks essential for influence diffusion
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a cellular sheaf and a traditional graph structure in terms of representing relationships between vertices and edges?

- Influence maximization problem formulation
  - Why needed here: Establishes the optimization objective and constraints for selecting seed vertices to maximize influence spread
  - Quick check question: How does the influence maximization problem differ between progressive (IC, LT) and non-progressive (SIS) diffusion models?

- Graph neural networks and oversmoothing
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional GNN limitations is crucial for appreciating why sheaf-based approaches with reaction operators are needed
  - Quick check question: What causes oversmoothing in traditional GNNs, and how do sheaf-based approaches mitigate this issue?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sheaf GNN (diffusion-reaction process) -> Subgraph partitioning (Louvain algorithm) -> Seed selection optimization (MLP-based) -> Training pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Learn sheaf coefficients from data
  2. Construct weighted graph and partition into subgraphs
  3. Train sheaf GNN with reaction operators
  4. Optimize seed selection within subgraphs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Layer depth vs. computational cost: Deeper layers capture longer-range dependencies but increase training time
  - Feature dimension vs. expressiveness: Higher dimensions allow more complex representations but risk overfitting
  - Subgraph size vs. optimization quality: Smaller subgraphs reduce search space but may miss global optima

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor influence estimation accuracy indicates issues with sheaf coefficient learning or reaction operator design
  - Suboptimal seed selection suggests problems with subgraph partitioning or optimization objective
  - High variance across runs may indicate insufficient training data or unstable optimization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify sheaf coefficient learning on a small synthetic network with known diffusion patterns
  2. Test reaction operator contributions by comparing performance with and without them
  3. Evaluate subgraph partitioning quality by measuring influence overlap between subgraphs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DeepSN framework perform when extended to multi-state diffusion models, such as multi-stage epidemic models or opinion dynamics with more than two states?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that the current framework only supports diffusion models with two states and suggests extending it to handle more complex models as a future work avenue.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or theoretical analysis for multi-state diffusion models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepSN on multi-state diffusion models, along with theoretical analysis of its performance and limitations in such scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different reaction term configurations on DeepSN's performance, and how do these configurations affect the model's ability to capture complex diffusion dynamics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions an ablation study on reaction operators, indicating that different configurations have an impact on performance, but does not provide detailed analysis or comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the ablation study and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different reaction term configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed ablation study comparing the performance of DeepSN with different reaction term configurations, including analysis of their effects on capturing complex diffusion dynamics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of GNN layers and feature dimension, affect the performance of DeepSN in influence maximization tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper includes an ablation study on the impact of layer depth and feature dimension, showing that performance improves with greater layer depth but only up to a certain point with increasing feature dimension.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides limited analysis of the impact of hyperparameters and does not explore the full range of possible values or their interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the impact of various hyperparameters on DeepSN's performance, including exploration of the full range of possible values and their interactions.

## Limitations

- The framework currently only supports diffusion models with two states, limiting its applicability to multi-stage epidemic models or opinion dynamics with more states
- The complexity of the framework with multiple interacting components makes it difficult to assess which innovations drive performance improvements
- Scalability concerns exist for extremely large networks where subgraph partitioning might miss globally optimal seed sets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The theoretical foundation using sheaf theory for modeling vertex-edge relationships is well-established in the literature. The mathematical formulation of sheaf diffusion-reaction processes appears sound and builds on existing cellular sheaf theory.

- **Medium Confidence**: The experimental results showing improvements over baseline methods, particularly for SIS diffusion models. While the methodology is reasonable, the specific hyperparameter choices and implementation details are not fully specified, making exact replication challenging.

- **Low Confidence**: The claimed ability to "learn diverse influence patterns in a data-driven, end-to-end manner" without overfitting to specific network structures. The complexity of the framework with multiple interacting components (sheaf coefficients, reaction operators, subgraph partitioning) makes it difficult to assess whether the improvements are due to the theoretical innovations or hyperparameter tuning.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study Validation**: Implement controlled experiments comparing DeepSN with and without reaction operators, and with static versus learned sheaf coefficients, to isolate which components drive performance improvements.

2. **Generalization Testing**: Test the framework on larger, more diverse networks (e.g., Twitter or Facebook-scale datasets) to verify scalability and assess whether the subgraph partitioning approach maintains effectiveness at scale.

3. **Robustness Analysis**: Evaluate performance across different parameter settings for the Louvain algorithm (resolution parameter) and GNN architecture (number of layers, feature dimensions) to determine sensitivity to hyperparameter choices.
