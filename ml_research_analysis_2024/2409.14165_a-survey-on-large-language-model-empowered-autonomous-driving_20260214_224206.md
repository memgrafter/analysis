## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic survey of Large Language Model (LLM) applications in autonomous driving (AD), examining how LLMs address challenges in both traditional modular and emerging end-to-end AD approaches. The authors categorize LLM applications across the AD pipeline, analyzing their reasoning capabilities, common sense knowledge, and communication abilities. The survey identifies solution insights ranging from A (strong capability) to C (limited capability) for addressing specific AD challenges, concluding that LLMs significantly enhance AD systems by bridging the gap between data-driven and knowledge-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a comprehensive literature review methodology to categorize LLM applications in autonomous driving systems. The authors systematically analyze existing research across the AD pipeline, examining perception, prediction, planning, control, and end-to-end approaches. They evaluate how LLMs address specific challenges through their reasoning capabilities, common sense knowledge, and communication abilities, assigning solution insight ratings (A-C) to assess effectiveness. The methodology includes analysis of both modular and end-to-end AD approaches, with particular attention to how LLMs can integrate with traditional AD components or serve as complete replacements in end-to-end systems.

## Key Results
- LLMs enhance AD systems through reasoning capabilities, common sense knowledge, and communication abilities
- Solution Insights ratings (A-C) systematically evaluate LLM effectiveness across AD challenges
- LLMs bridge data-driven and knowledge-based approaches in autonomous driving
- Critical limitations identified including hallucination problems, response time issues, and physical world understanding gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs work in autonomous driving contexts by leveraging their ability to process natural language instructions, reason about complex scenarios, and access vast knowledge bases. Their multimodal capabilities allow integration of textual, visual, and environmental information, while their reasoning mechanisms enable understanding of traffic rules, social conventions, and driving strategies. The large-scale pretraining on diverse data provides LLMs with foundational knowledge about the physical world, human behavior, and driving contexts, which can be adapted through fine-tuning for specific AD tasks. Their communication abilities facilitate interaction with passengers, other vehicles, and infrastructure systems.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Modular vs End-to-End AD Approaches** - Understanding the fundamental difference between traditional pipeline-based AD systems and integrated learning-based approaches is crucial for evaluating LLM applications. Quick check: Can the system distinguish between perception-planning-control separation and unified learning architectures?

2. **LLM Reasoning Capabilities** - LLMs can process complex instructions, infer missing information, and apply logical reasoning to driving scenarios. Quick check: Can the LLM handle ambiguous traffic situations requiring inference beyond explicit rules?

3. **Common Sense Knowledge in Driving Contexts** - Understanding social norms, traffic conventions, and physical world principles is essential for safe driving. Quick check: Does the system demonstrate appropriate behavior in socially complex driving scenarios?

4. **Multimodal Integration** - LLMs can combine text, vision, and other sensory inputs for comprehensive environmental understanding. Quick check: Can the system effectively fuse visual perception with natural language instructions?

5. **Safety-Critical Decision Making** - AD systems must make reliable decisions under uncertainty while prioritizing safety. Quick check: Does the system maintain safety margins and conservative behavior in ambiguous situations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Perception -> Prediction -> Planning -> Control -> End-to-End Integration
**Critical Path:** Sensor input → LLM processing → Decision output → Vehicle actuation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Traditional modular AD offers interpretability and modularity but lacks adaptability; End-to-end AD offers integration but reduced transparency
**Failure Signatures:** Hallucinations in perception interpretation, delayed response times in safety-critical scenarios, misunderstanding of physical constraints
**First Experiments:**
1. Test LLM perception accuracy on standard driving datasets compared to specialized perception models
2. Evaluate response time latency in emergency braking scenarios
3. Assess cross-cultural driving behavior adaptation across different geographic regions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions regarding LLM applications in autonomous driving, including the scalability of LLM-based solutions to real-world deployment, the integration challenges between LLMs and existing AD hardware systems, and the validation frameworks needed to ensure safety and reliability. The relationship between Artificial General Intelligence development and driving intelligence remains unclear, as does the optimal balance between data-driven and knowledge-based approaches. The paper also questions how to address the hallucination problems and response time limitations that are particularly critical in safety-critical driving scenarios.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of LLM performance across diverse real-world driving conditions
- Theoretical analysis of end-to-end approaches without comprehensive real-world testing data
- Insufficient discussion of safety validation frameworks and deployment challenges
- Hallucination problems and response time issues not quantified with specific performance metrics

## Confidence

| Major Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| Comprehensive categorization of LLM applications in AD | High |
| Identification of LLM limitations in AD contexts | High |

| Bridging of data-driven and knowledge-based approaches | Medium |
| Relationship between AGI development and driving intelligence | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical testing of LLM-based AD components across diverse real-world driving scenarios to validate the Solution Insights ratings
2. Perform systematic analysis of hallucination rates and response times in safety-critical AD situations
3. Evaluate the transferability of LLM-enhanced AD systems across different geographic regions and driving cultures to assess generalization capabilities
