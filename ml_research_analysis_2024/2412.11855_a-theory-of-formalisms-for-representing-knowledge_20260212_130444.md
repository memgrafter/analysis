# A Theory of Formalisms for Representing Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.11855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11855
- Authors: Heng Zhang; Guifei Jiang; Donghui Quan
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: All universal knowledge representation formalisms are recursively isomorphic

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the longstanding debate over knowledge representation formalisms (KRFs) in AI by proposing a general framework for comparing different approaches. The authors define a universal KRF, Θ, based on Turing machines and prove that all universal KRFs are recursively isomorphic to each other. They also show that any two KRFs with equal expressive power and the padding property are recursively isomorphic. These results suggest that, up to offline compilation, all universal or natural KRFs with the same expressive power are essentially equivalent, providing theoretical insight into the "declarative vs. procedural" and "symbolic vs. connectionist" debates.

## Method Summary
The paper constructs an abstract framework for KRFs based on abstract knowledge bases (classes of database-query pairs) and query languages (fragments of first-order logic). It defines quasi KRFs as mappings from theories to knowledge bases, then adds an implementability condition to obtain KRFs. The canonical KRF Θ is constructed by mapping each Turing machine to a knowledge base representing its behavior. The authors prove that Θ is universal and that all universal KRFs are recursively isomorphic. They extend this to subrecursive KRFs by showing that those with equal expressive power and the padding property are also recursively isomorphic.

## Key Results
- All universal KRFs over (D, Q) are recursively isomorphic
- Any two KRFs that are equally expressive and admit the padding property are recursively isomorphic
- The canonical KRF Θ based on Turing machines serves as a universal formalism for knowledge representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: All universal knowledge representation formalisms are recursively isomorphic, meaning they can be effectively transformed into each other.
- Mechanism: The paper constructs a canonical KRF (Θ) based on Turing machines and proves that any other universal KRF can be reduced to Θ through recursive functions. By the transitivity of reducibility, all universal KRFs must be recursively isomorphic to each other.
- Core assumption: The existence of a universal KRF and the effectiveness of the reduction functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms, and prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic"
  - [section] "Theorem 3. All universal KRFs over (D, Q) are recursively isomorphic"
- Break condition: If a KRF cannot be reduced to Θ or if the reduction functions are not effective, the isomorphism would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Any two KRFs that are equally expressive and admit the padding property are recursively isomorphic.
- Mechanism: The padding property allows trivial extensions of theories without changing their meaning. This enables the construction of injective reductions between KRFs, and when both directions have injective reductions, the KRFs are recursively isomorphic.
- Core assumption: The padding property holds for natural KRFs and that expressiveness can be compared effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, we show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding property are also recursively isomorphic"
  - [section] "Theorem 4. All equally strong KRFs over (D, Q) that admit the padding property are recursively isomorphic"
- Break condition: If the padding property doesn't hold for a KRF or if expressiveness cannot be effectively compared, the isomorphism would fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The canonical KRF Θ serves as a universal formalism for knowledge representation, up to an offline compilation.
- Mechanism: Θ is constructed by mapping each Turing machine M to the knowledge base K(M*), where M* is a modified version of M that implements the closure properties of KBs. This allows Θ to represent all recursively enumerable KBs.
- Core assumption: Turing machines can effectively represent knowledge bases and that the modification procedure is correct.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms"
  - [section] "Definition 9. Let Θ denote the mapping which maps [ [M *] ] to K(M * ) for every Turing machineM"
- Break condition: If the modification procedure is incorrect or if some knowledge bases cannot be represented by Turing machines, Θ would not be universal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Representation Formalisms (KRFs)
  - Why needed here: The paper is about comparing and classifying different KRFs, so understanding what they are is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: What are the three key properties that a KRF must satisfy according to Definition 5?

- Concept: Recursive Isomorphism
  - Why needed here: The main result of the paper is that all universal KRFs are recursively isomorphic, so understanding this concept is crucial.
  - Quick check question: If two KRFs Γ and Γ0 are recursively isomorphic, what does this imply about their expressive power and structure?

- Concept: Padding Property
  - Why needed here: The padding property is a key condition for the isomorphism of subrecursive KRFs, so understanding it is important.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a KRF to admit the padding property, and why is this property important for the paper's results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Abstract knowledge bases (database-query pairs) -> Query languages (fragments of first-order logic) -> Quasi KRFs (mappings from theories to knowledge bases) -> KRFs (with implementability condition) -> Universal KRFs (can represent all others) -> Canonical KRF Θ (based on Turing machines)

- Critical path:
  1. Define abstract knowledge bases and query languages.
  2. Construct qKRFs and KRFs.
  3. Prove the existence of a universal KRF (Θ).
  4. Show that all universal KRFs are recursively isomorphic.
  5. Extend the results to subrecursive KRFs with the padding property.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. complexity: More expressive KRFs may be harder to implement or reason about.
  - Declarative vs. procedural representations: Different paradigms for representing knowledge.
  - Universal vs. specialized KRFs: Universal KRFs can represent all others but may be less efficient for specific tasks.

- Failure signatures:
  - If a KRF cannot be reduced to Θ, it's not universal.
  - If the padding property doesn't hold for a KRF, it may not be isomorphic to other KRFs.
  - If the reduction functions are not effective, the isomorphisms would not hold.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that the canonical KRF Θ satisfies the properties of a KRF by testing it with simple Turing machines and knowledge bases.
  2. Test the reducibility of a known KRF to Θ by constructing the reduction function and verifying that it preserves the knowledge base.
  3. Check the padding property for a simple KRF by finding an infinite set of theories that map to the same knowledge base.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the framework extend to more expressive logics beyond first-order logic (FO) while maintaining the recursive isomorphism results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "most of the results presented in this paper can be generalized to other semi-decidable logics" but focus on FO for simplicity
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily develops theory within FO, leaving extension to more expressive logics (e.g., higher-order logics, fixpoint logics) as an open direction
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing that universal KRFs in more expressive logics are also recursively isomorphic, or counterexamples demonstrating limitations

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the padding property be relaxed or replaced with a weaker condition while still preserving recursive isomorphism for equally strong KRFs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use the padding property as a key condition in Theorem 4, noting it "holds for almost all the natural expressive formalisms"
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore whether this is the minimal condition needed, leaving open whether other structural properties could serve the same role
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of a strictly weaker condition that still guarantees recursive isomorphism, or proof that padding is indeed necessary

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework handle probabilistic or uncertainty-aware knowledge representation formalisms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current framework focuses on deterministic knowledge bases and query answering, with no discussion of uncertainty or probabilistic reasoning
- Why unresolved: Modern AI systems increasingly incorporate uncertainty, yet the framework appears limited to classical logic-based formalisms
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension of the framework to handle probabilistic KRFs (e.g., Bayesian networks, probabilistic logic) and analysis of whether recursive isomorphism results still hold

## Limitations

- The canonical KRF Θ is constructed using Turing machines, which may not capture all aspects of practical knowledge representation systems
- The padding property assumption for subrecursive KRFs may not hold for all natural formalisms
- The reduction procedures between KRFs are theoretical constructs that may not be efficient or practical for real-world applications

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the theoretical framework and basic results: The mathematical foundations are well-established, and the proofs follow logically from the definitions.

**Medium confidence** in the practical implications: While the theoretical results are compelling, the connection to real-world knowledge representation systems requires further investigation.

**Medium confidence** in the universality claim: The results hold under the given definitions, but alternative formulations of KRFs might yield different conclusions.

## Next Checks

1. Implement a concrete version of the canonical KRF Θ and test it with various Turing machines to verify that it correctly represents knowledge bases as claimed in Definition 9.

2. Examine a practical KRF (such as a simple logical system or neural network) to determine whether it satisfies the padding property and can be effectively reduced to/from Θ.

3. Conduct a case study comparing the performance of knowledge bases represented in different KRFs (e.g., logical vs. neural) to assess the practical impact of the theoretical isomorphisms.
