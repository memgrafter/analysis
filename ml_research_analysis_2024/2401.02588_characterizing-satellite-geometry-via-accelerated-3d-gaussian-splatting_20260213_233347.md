# Characterizing Satellite Geometry via Accelerated 3D Gaussian Splatting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.02588
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02588
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses the challenge of characterizing the 3D geometry of unknown, non-cooperative satellites in orbit for autonomous on-orbit servicing and debris removal missions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of characterizing the 3D geometry of unknown, non-cooperative satellites in orbit for autonomous on-orbit servicing and debris removal missions. The authors propose using 3D Gaussian Splatting, a novel technique that offers faster training and rendering times compared to previous NeRF-based methods while maintaining high-quality 3D reconstructions. They demonstrate their approach on a hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up under various lighting and motion conditions, showing that their model can be trained on-board and render higher quality novel views of an unknown satellite nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms.

## Method Summary
The method uses 3D Gaussian Splatting with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera calibration and point cloud initialization. The pipeline involves using COLMAP for SfM to generate camera parameters and sparse point clouds, converting these points to Gaussian means with covariances, and then optimizing the Gaussian representation using differentiable end-to-end training with L1 loss and LD-SSIM. The approach is tested on a hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up captured using an iPhone 13 from multiple viewing angles, demonstrating both training on-board capability and significantly faster rendering compared to NeRF-based methods.

## Key Results
- Model trained on-board and rendered higher quality novel views of unknown satellites nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms
- Demonstrated on hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up under various lighting and motion conditions
- Showed faster training and rendering times while maintaining high-quality 3D reconstructions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves faster rendering than NeRF-based methods due to point-based representation instead of volumetric ray tracing.
- Mechanism: 3D Gaussian Splatting uses discrete Gaussian points with pre-sorted tile-based rendering, avoiding the expensive per-pixel volumetric sampling required by NeRF's neural radiance field representation.
- Core assumption: The Gaussian splatting representation can maintain sufficient visual quality while eliminating the need for neural network inference during rendering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Replacing NeRF representation with a point-based representation reduces training times since there is no huge neural network to optimize. In addition, the point-based scene representation avoids NeRF's reliance on a full volumetric representation of the scene. Hence, 3D Splatting avoids NeRF's expensive sampling of points on the paths traced by each ray and passing them through a large neural network."
  - "3D Gaussian Splatting uses a tile-based rasterizer that pre-sorts the Gaussian splats using GPU radix search for the entire image. This allows fast tile-based α-blending without per-pixel rendering of points."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: On-board training capability is enabled by the relatively low computational requirements of 3D Gaussian Splatting compared to NeRF methods.
- Mechanism: 3D Gaussian Splatting requires less VRAM and shorter training time because it doesn't need to train a large neural network, making it feasible for spaceflight hardware constraints.
- Core assumption: Current spaceflight hardware has sufficient compute capacity for 3D Gaussian Splatting training despite being less powerful than desktop GPUs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Our model is shown to be capable of training on-board and rendering higher quality novel views of an unknown satellite nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms."
  - "Training time and resource consumption is shown in Table 2. All NeRF-based models stay consistent across all lighting cases... On the other hand, Gaussian Splatting-based methods have different resource usage pattern across all cases."
  - "Instant NeRF and 3DGS training resource consumption and training time are the best across all compared methods."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) provides an effective initialization for the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.
- Mechanism: SfM creates a sparse point cloud from multiple images that serves as the initial mean positions for the Gaussian splatting representation, providing a good starting point for optimization.
- Core assumption: The SfM point cloud accurately captures the overall structure of the satellite even if it lacks fine details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "SfM reconstructs the 3D structure of the target. This involves estimating camera parameters and creating a three-dimensional point cloud for the target. We use COLMAP [34] to perform the spare reconstruction of the data images."
  - "3D Gaussian Splatting repurposes the SfM point cloud to initialize the means of a set of 3D Gaussian random variables."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and volumetric rendering
  - Why needed here: Understanding the baseline method being improved upon helps grasp why 3D Gaussian Splatting is faster
  - Quick check question: What are the main computational bottlenecks in NeRF that 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to address?

- Concept: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and camera calibration
  - Why needed here: SfM is the first step in the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, providing the initial point cloud
  - Quick check question: How does SfM use multiple images to reconstruct 3D structure, and what information does it output?

- Concept: Gaussian splatting and α-blending
  - Why needed here: The core rendering technique differs fundamentally from ray tracing and requires understanding of how splats combine
  - Quick check question: How does α-blending work in the context of Gaussian splatting to produce the final rendered image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SfM pipeline (COLMAP) -> Gaussian initialization -> Gaussian optimization -> Tile-based rasterizer -> Loss function
- Critical path: SfM → Gaussian initialization → Optimization → Rendering
- Design tradeoffs:
  - More Gaussians = higher quality but more memory/computation
  - Training time vs. rendering speed tradeoff (can pre-train and deploy)
  - Accuracy vs. speed in SfM initialization
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor SfM reconstruction → noisy initialization → optimization divergence
  - Insufficient Gaussians → missing geometry or holes in reconstruction
  - Numerical instability in covariance optimization → exploding Gaussians
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SfM on provided dataset to verify point cloud generation and camera calibration
  2. Initialize 3D Gaussian Splatting with SfM points and verify basic optimization
  3. Test rendering on small subset to verify tile-based rasterizer and α-blending

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well does the 3D Gaussian Splatting approach generalize to satellites with significantly different geometries or surface materials than those used in the experiments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the approach on a specific satellite mock-up but does not discuss its performance on diverse satellite designs.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single satellite mock-up and does not explore the model's robustness to varying satellite geometries, materials, or component configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a dataset containing diverse satellite types (e.g., different shapes, sizes, surface materials) and comparing its performance metrics (SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS) across these variations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of partial occlusions or missing data on the quality of the 3D reconstruction when using 3D Gaussian Splatting for satellite characterization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses rendering quality under various lighting conditions but does not explicitly address the impact of occlusions or incomplete data.
- Why unresolved: Real-world scenarios may involve partial occlusions (e.g., by other objects, shadows) or missing views, which could affect the reconstruction quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where portions of the satellite mock-up are intentionally occluded during data capture and analyzing the resulting 3D reconstruction quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting compare to other state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods specifically designed for space applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares 3D Gaussian Splatting with NeRF, D-NeRF, Instant NeRF, and 4D Gaussian Splatting but does not mention other space-specific methods.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a comprehensive comparison with general-purpose methods, it does not explore specialized techniques tailored for space environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking 3D Gaussian Splatting against space-specific 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., those designed for low-light conditions, high dynamic range imaging) on the same dataset.

## Limitations
- The hardware-in-the-loop setup using a planar Cartesian simulator and satellite mock-up is not fully described, making exact replication challenging
- Critical hyperparameters for the 3D Gaussian Splatting model are not specified, particularly regarding the number of Gaussians, learning rates, and optimization schedules
- Computational environment differences between desktop GPUs and spaceflight hardware create uncertainty about whether on-board training would translate to actual space missions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The speed improvement claim (nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than NeRF) is well-supported by theoretical analysis and multiple quantitative metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: The on-board training capability claim is supported by resource usage comparisons, but actual feasibility depends on specific spaceflight hardware constraints.

**Low Confidence**: The generalization claim across various lighting and motion conditions is demonstrated on the specific hardware-in-the-loop setup, but extent to which results would translate to actual on-orbit conditions remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **SfM Initialization Validation**: Run COLMAP on a subset of the provided dataset to verify that the structure-from-motion pipeline produces accurate camera calibrations and point clouds, checking that the estimated camera parameters match the known physical setup.

2. **Training Resource Profiling**: Train the 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a representative subset of data while monitoring VRAM usage, training time per iteration, and memory consumption to verify that the reported resource usage metrics are reproducible on comparable hardware.

3. **Rendering Performance Benchmarking**: Compare the rendering speed and quality of the trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model against the reported NeRF baselines using the same hardware setup, measuring FPS, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics to confirm the claimed performance improvements.
