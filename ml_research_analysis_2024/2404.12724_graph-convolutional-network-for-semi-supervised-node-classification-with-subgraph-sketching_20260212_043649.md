# Graph Convolutional Network For Semi-supervised Node Classification With Subgraph Sketching

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.12724
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12724
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GLDGCN achieves higher classification accuracy on citation and social networks by combining dual convolutional layers with PPMI matrices and a graph learning layer that can handle both graph and non-graph data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses limitations of traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in processing large graphs and handling non-graph data. The authors propose GLDGCN, which introduces a dual convolutional layer and a graph learning layer to enhance feature extraction and extend GCN's applicability to general matrix data. To handle large graphs, they also design CLGCN that combines subgraph clustering and stochastic gradient descent techniques. Experiments on citation networks, social networks, and large-scale datasets demonstrate that GLDGCN achieves higher classification accuracy compared to baseline methods, and CLGCN effectively processes large graphs while maintaining competitive performance.

## Method Summary
GLDGCN enhances traditional GCNs by introducing a dual convolutional layer that processes both adjacency matrices and PPMI matrices, along with a graph learning layer that can handle non-graph data by learning similarity matrices. The dual convolution captures complementary graph structure information, while the graph learning layer constructs data-driven similarity graphs. For large-scale graphs, CLGCN partitions graphs into subgraphs using METIS clustering and applies mini-batch SGD training, reducing memory requirements from O(NpL) to O(bpL) where b is batch size. The method is evaluated on citation networks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed), social networks (KarateClub), and large-scale datasets (PPI and Reddit).

## Key Results
- GLDGCN achieves higher classification accuracy compared to baseline methods on citation networks, social networks, and large-scale datasets.
- CLGCN effectively processes large graphs (PPI and Reddit datasets) while maintaining competitive performance.
- Subgraph structure recognition improves GCN's expressive ability and interpretability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GLDGCN improves classification accuracy by combining dual convolutional layers with PPMI matrices and a graph learning layer that can handle both graph and non-graph data.
- Mechanism: The dual convolutional layer extracts complementary features from both adjacency and PPMI matrices, while the graph learning layer constructs a data-driven similarity graph for non-graph inputs, allowing GCNs to process general matrix data.
- Core assumption: The PPMI matrix captures meaningful higher-order graph structure beyond the adjacency matrix, and the learned similarity graph preserves essential relationships for classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GLDGCN introduces a dual convolutional layer and a graph learning layer to enhance feature extraction and extend GCN's applicability to general matrix data."
  - [section]: "GLDGCN extracts the PPMI matrix of graph through the dual convolution layer, which is a supplement to the feature of adjacency matrix."
  - [corpus]: Weak anchor; no direct citations to PPMI or graph learning in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If the learned similarity graph does not reflect true class structure or PPMI does not encode useful higher-order information, performance degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CLGCN enables scalable GCN training on large graphs by partitioning graphs into subgraphs and applying mini-batch SGD.
- Mechanism: Graph partitioning via METIS creates disjoint subgraphs; each subgraph is processed independently in a mini-batch, reducing GPU memory from O(NpL) to O(bpL) where b ≪ N.
- Core assumption: Partitioning preserves local neighborhood structure sufficiently for effective training; subgraphs can be processed independently without significant information loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CLGCN divides large graphs into smaller subgraphs, enabling efficient mini-batch training and reducing memory requirements."
  - [section]: "The algorithm is based on the efficient graph clustering algorithm METIS[47] to design batches, combined with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) techniques to reduce the spatial overhead."
  - [corpus]: Weak anchor; neighbor papers discuss subgraph mining but not METIS-based batching.
- Break condition: If partitioning breaks critical long-range dependencies or creates biased training batches, classification accuracy suffers.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using subgraph clustering improves GCN's expressive ability and interpretability by enabling deeper architectures on large graphs.
- Mechanism: Mini-batch training via subgraph clustering allows stacking more GCN layers without OOM, and training on multiple subgraph batches helps the model learn important subgraph structures that enhance generalization.
- Core assumption: Deeper GCNs capture more complex patterns, and subgraph structure recognition is key to GCN expressiveness and graph isomorphism handling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The introduction of subgraph clustering technology also enables us to design personalized cluster graph convolutional neural networks...so as to improve the generalization ability of GCN."
  - [section]: "The recognition of subgraph structure is very important to improve the expressive ability of GCN, which can help it solve the graph isomorphism problem [51] more effectively."
  - [corpus]: Weak anchor; no direct citations to subgraph clustering for GCN depth in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If deeper layers cause oversmoothing or if subgraph structure is not discriminative, gains are lost.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Fourier Transform and spectral graph convolution
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on spectral GCN theory and approximates spectral filters with localized spatial filters; understanding this link is essential to grasp GLDGCN's convolutional design.
  - Quick check question: Why does the approximation gθ′(Λ) ≈ Σ θ′kTk(eΛ) enable localized spatial filtering instead of global spectral filtering?

- Concept: Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) and random walk statistics
  - Why needed here: PPMI matrix construction from random walk frequencies is central to the dual convolutional layer; misinterpreting PPMI would break understanding of how it supplements adjacency features.
  - Quick check question: How does the PPMI matrix differ from the adjacency matrix in capturing graph structure, and why might it be more informative?

- Concept: Stochastic Gradient Descent and mini-batch training on graphs
  - Why needed here: CLGCN's scalability relies on mini-batch SGD over subgraphs; without this, the clustering approach's memory benefits are unclear.
  - Quick check question: What is the space complexity difference between full-batch and mini-batch GCN training, and how does subgraph partitioning achieve this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Layer -> Graph Learning Layer -> Dual Convolutional Layers (Adjacency + PPMI) -> Output Layer

- Critical path:
  1. For non-graph data: Graph Learning Layer → S matrix
  2. Compute PPMI of S
  3. Dual conv layers process A and PPMI(S) in parallel
  4. Concatenate or combine conv outputs
  5. Apply softmax classifier
  6. For large graphs: Partition → mini-batch training via SGD

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GLDGCN: Dual conv layers add parameters and computation but improve expressiveness; graph learning layer adds flexibility but requires hyperparameter tuning (γ, β).
  - CLGCN: Subgraph partitioning reduces memory but may lose cross-subgraph signal; more batches improve learning but increase iteration count.

- Failure signatures:
  - GLDGCN: Poor accuracy if learned S is noisy or PPMI does not capture useful structure; instability if hyperparameters poorly chosen.
  - CLGCN: Degraded accuracy if partitioning creates biased label distributions or breaks long-range dependencies; slow convergence if too many small batches.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run GLDGCN on Cora with default hyperparameters; verify dual conv layers improve over plain GCN.
  2. Vary γ in graph learning layer on Citeseer; observe effect on learned S and classification accuracy.
  3. Implement CLGCN on Pubmed; compare memory usage and accuracy against full-batch GLDGCN with varying numbers of subgraph batches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can GLDGCN be extended to handle dynamic graphs that change over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on static graphs, but many real-world applications involve dynamic graphs that evolve over time.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study**: Remove the graph learning layer and PPMI convolutions separately on Cora/Citeseer to quantify their individual contributions to accuracy improvements.

2. **Memory Analysis**: Profile GPU memory usage for GLDGCN vs CLGCN on Reddit dataset to verify the claimed O(bpL) vs O(NpL) scaling relationship.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary γ (graph learning regularization) and β (PPMI regularization) on KarateClub to determine optimal ranges and stability of the proposed model.
