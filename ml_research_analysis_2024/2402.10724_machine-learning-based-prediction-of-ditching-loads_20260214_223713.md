## Executive Summary
This study presents machine learning approaches to predict dynamic ditching loads on aircraft fuselages. The method uses a two-step procedure: first reconstructing spatial loads using convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), then predicting their temporal evolution using either LSTM networks or Koopman-operator based methods. Four different surrogate models were developed and tested on a full-scale DLR-D150 aircraft fuselage. The models were trained on data from 323 ditching simulations with varying horizontal and vertical approach velocities. Results showed satisfactory predictive agreement for all four models, with the combination of an LSTM and a deep decoder CAE (CJMDD) achieving the best performance. The average errors of the CJMDD predictions were approximately 35% smaller than the other models, and the errors remained below 2% of peak loads for all time steps.

## Method Summary
The research employs a two-stage machine learning approach for predicting ditching loads. First, spatial load distributions are reconstructed using convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) - specifically deep decoder CAE (DCAE), stacked CAE (SCAE), and deep stacked CAE (DSCAE). Second, temporal evolution of these loads is predicted using either Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Koopman-based Autoencoder (KAE). The models are trained on 323 high-fidelity ditching simulations of a full-scale DLR-D150 aircraft fuselage with varying approach velocities. The temporal predictions cover the first 1.5 seconds of impact. The study compares four different model combinations: LSTM with DCAE, LSTM with DSCAE, KAE, and a sequential combination of LSTM and DSCAE (CJMDD).

## Key Results
- CJMDD model achieved the best performance with average errors approximately 35% smaller than other models
- All four models maintained errors below 2% of peak loads for all time steps
- KAE showed mixed performance, outperforming LSTM-based models in one test case but underperforming in another
- Models were successfully trained and validated on 323 ditching simulations of a full-scale aircraft fuselage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage approach separates spatial and temporal learning, allowing each model to focus on its specific task. CAEs effectively compress and reconstruct complex spatial load distributions, while LSTM networks excel at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. The Koopman-based approach provides an alternative for temporal prediction that can capture nonlinear dynamics through linear approximations in transformed spaces. The combination of models (CJMDD) leverages complementary strengths, with the CAE handling spatial reconstruction and the LSTM managing temporal evolution.

## Foundational Learning
- Convolutional autoencoders: Compress spatial data into latent representations and reconstruct it, enabling efficient storage and processing of complex load distributions. Quick check: Verify that latent dimension is sufficiently small to enable compression while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.
- LSTM networks: Capture temporal dependencies in sequential data through memory cells and gating mechanisms. Quick check: Monitor training loss curves to ensure LSTM is learning temporal patterns rather than memorizing sequences.
- Koopman operator theory: Linearize nonlinear dynamical systems by transforming them into appropriate function spaces. Quick check: Validate that the Koopman modes capture the essential dynamics of the ditching event.
- Deep decoder CAE: Generate high-quality reconstructions from compressed representations without requiring encoder-decoder symmetry. Quick check: Compare reconstruction quality against traditional symmetric autoencoders.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Simulation data -> CAE (spatial) -> Latent representation -> LSTM/KAE (temporal) -> Load predictions

Critical path: The most critical computational path runs from CAE latent representation through the LSTM/KAE to final predictions. The quality of the latent representation directly impacts the temporal model's performance.

Design tradeoffs: The study chose to separate spatial and temporal learning to leverage specialized architectures. An alternative would be end-to-end models, but these may struggle with the different characteristics of spatial versus temporal data. The number of CAE layers and latent dimensions represent key hyperparameters balancing reconstruction quality against computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Poor spatial reconstruction quality from CAEs manifests as systematic errors in predicted load distributions. Temporal prediction failures appear as phase shifts or incorrect amplitude predictions in load time series. KAE-specific failures include poor reconstruction when linear predictability assumption is violated.

First experiments: 1) Test CAE reconstruction quality on held-out spatial data before temporal prediction. 2) Evaluate LSTM/KAE performance on synthetic temporal sequences with known properties. 3) Benchmark against baseline constant-load prediction to establish minimum performance threshold.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the inclusion of structural deformation data affect the predictive accuracy of the ML models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that a medium-term goal is to consider deformation-related load changes using a simplified two-way coupling, suggesting that structural deformations could be incorporated into the models.
- Why unresolved: The current study only focuses on predicting hydrodynamic loads, and the impact of structural deformations on the model accuracy is not investigated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and testing the ML models with data that includes structural deformation information and comparing the results to the current models would provide evidence for the impact of structural deformations on predictive accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the KAE compare to the LSTM-based models when predicting loads for aircraft with different geometries or operating conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the KAE performs better than the LSTM-based models for one test case but worse for another, suggesting that the performance may vary depending on the specific conditions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the models on two specific cases, and it is unclear how they would perform for other aircraft geometries or operating conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the models on a wider range of aircraft geometries and operating conditions would provide evidence for the generalizability of the KAE compared to the LSTM-based models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of loss function coefficients affect the performance of the KAE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the loss function coefficients (𝛼reconst, 𝛼predict, 𝛼linear) were tuned for the KAE, and that larger values of 𝛼linear can lead to poor performance or even a trivial solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study of how different loss function coefficients affect the performance of the KAE.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic study of the KAE's performance with different loss function coefficients would provide evidence for the optimal choice of these parameters.

## Limitations
- Results were obtained using only a single full-scale DLR-D150 aircraft fuselage, limiting generalizability to other aircraft geometries
- Training dataset of 323 simulations, while substantial, may not capture the complete range of possible ditching scenarios
- Temporal predictions were limited to the first 1.5 seconds of impact, potentially missing longer-term structural responses
- No comparison against traditional physics-based ditching prediction methods to benchmark ML performance

## Confidence

High confidence:
- ML methodology effectiveness: Consistent performance across all four models with quantitative error metrics

Medium confidence:
- CJMDD as optimal model: Best performance observed but limited model comparisons and single-aircraft focus
- Practical applicability for design verification: Promising results but broader validation across different aircraft types and real-world conditions needed

## Next Checks
1. Test the ML models on ditching data from multiple aircraft geometries beyond the DLR-D150 to assess generalizability
2. Compare ML predictions against traditional physics-based ditching analysis methods to establish relative performance
3. Extend validation to longer time periods beyond 1.5 seconds and include more extreme ditching scenarios to test model robustness
