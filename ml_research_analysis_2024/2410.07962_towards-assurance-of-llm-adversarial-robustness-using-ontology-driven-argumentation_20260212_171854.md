# Towards Assurance of LLM Adversarial Robustness using Ontology-Driven Argumentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.07962
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07962
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Novel ontology-driven approach for assuring LLM adversarial robustness using formal knowledge structures and assurance cases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for assuring the adversarial robustness of large language models using ontology-driven argumentation. The method structures knowledge about attacks and defenses in a formal ontology, enabling both human-readable assurance cases and machine-readable representations. The approach is demonstrated through examples in natural language and code translation tasks, showing how heterogeneous knowledge about LLM security can be explicitly formalized and reasoned about.

## Method Summary
The approach uses ontologies to formalize state-of-the-art attacks and defenses, facilitating the creation of assurance cases using Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). It structures knowledge as semantic triples in RDF, enabling queries to retrieve and update parameter values from a central repository. The method separates concerns of explication, reasoning, maintenance, and auditing while providing an explainable representation of robustness for multiple stakeholders.

## Key Results
- Enables continuous reasoning against changes by querying parameter values from a central repository
- Provides shared understanding of training, guardrails, and implementation for engineers, data scientists, users, and auditors
- Demonstrates application in both natural language and code translation tasks with attack success rate querying capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ontology-driven approach enables continuous reasoning against changes in LLM adversarial robustness by providing a centralized knowledge base.
- Mechanism: The ontology structures heterogeneous knowledge about attacks and defenses as semantic triples, allowing queries to retrieve and update parameter values from a central repository.
- Core assumption: The ontology can capture the full complexity of LLM attacks and defenses in a formal structure that supports reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using ontologies for formalization, we structure state-of-the-art attacks and defenses, facilitating the creation of a human-readable assurance case, and a machine-readable representation."
  - [section] "The ontology allows attack- and defense-relevant values to be retrieved, calculated, and inserted with complex queries, while showing the argument and architecture to readers."
- Break condition: The ontology becomes too complex to maintain or fails to capture novel attack patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Assurance cases structured with GSN and ontologies provide a shared understanding of training, guardrails, and implementation for multiple stakeholders.
- Mechanism: The combination of GSN metamodel with ontology-driven semantic triples creates a bridge between human-readable arguments and machine-readable knowledge representation.
- Core assumption: Stakeholders can understand and use the structured assurance cases effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The approach structures knowledge about attacks and defenses in a formal ontology, enabling the creation of both human-readable assurance cases and machine-readable representations."
  - [section] "We posit that this setup and pipeline separates the following maintenance concerns while providing an explainable representation of robustness..."
- Break condition: Stakeholders cannot effectively interpret the assurance cases or the ontology structure becomes too abstract.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The approach supports both natural language and code translation tasks by formalizing domain-specific attack patterns and defenses.
- Mechanism: The ontology can be instantiated with different application domains while maintaining the same underlying structure for attacks, defenses, and assurance arguments.
- Core assumption: The core ontology structure is sufficiently generic to handle different LLM application domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We demonstrate its application with examples in English language and code translation tasks..."
  - [section] "LLMs used for domain-specific language tasks can similarly be susceptible to simple adversarial attacks [13]."
- Break condition: Domain-specific nuances cannot be adequately captured by the generic ontology structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Resource Description Framework (RDF) and semantic triples
  - Why needed here: The approach uses RDF to represent knowledge as subject-predicate-object triples, which forms the foundation of the ontology structure.
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the relationship "attack A has success rate 0.5" using RDF triples?

- Concept: Web Ontology Language (OWL) and ontology design
  - Why needed here: OWL provides the framework for defining classes, object properties, and data properties that structure the knowledge about LLM attacks and defenses.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of an OWL ontology used in this approach?

- Concept: Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) for assurance cases
  - Why needed here: GSN provides the structure for creating human-readable assurance arguments that can be linked to the machine-readable ontology.
  - Quick check question: What are the five main elements of GSN used to structure assurance cases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ontology engine -> GSN assurance case generator -> Middleware layer -> Experimental data input -> Query interface

- Critical path: Experimental data → Ontology updates → Query results → Assurance case generation → Stakeholder review

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. maintainability: More detailed ontologies capture more nuances but become harder to maintain
  - Generality vs. specificity: Generic structures work across domains but may miss domain-specific details
  - Human readability vs. machine efficiency: More natural language arguments are easier to understand but harder to query

- Failure signatures:
  - Ontology becomes inconsistent or contradictory
  - Query performance degrades as the knowledge base grows
  - Assurance cases become too complex for stakeholders to understand
  - Updates to the ontology don't propagate correctly to the assurance cases

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a minimal ontology with 2-3 attack types and defenses, verify that queries return expected results
  2. Create a simple GSN assurance case linked to the ontology, verify human readability
  3. Simulate an experimental update (changing attack success rates) and verify that both the ontology and assurance case update correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is the proposed ontology-driven argumentation approach in practice for assuring LLM adversarial robustness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the approach through examples but acknowledges it as "research-in-progress" and calls for "real-life implementations and industrial use cases"
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a conceptual framework and examples but lacks empirical evaluation of the approach's effectiveness in actual LLM deployments
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring the approach's effectiveness in detecting and preventing adversarial attacks on deployed LLMs, compared to existing methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the computational overheads and performance impacts of implementing the proposed ontology-driven argumentation approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the approach but doesn't discuss computational costs or performance implications
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the conceptual framework and benefits but doesn't address practical implementation concerns like computational efficiency
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing LLM response times and resource usage with and without the proposed approach

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the manual formalization of arguments and ontologies be automated to improve maintainability over time?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states "Future work will center on... addressing the limitation of manually formalizing arguments and ontologies"
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a limitation but doesn't propose solutions for automation
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and demonstration of automated tools for ontology generation and argument formalization from LLM training data and attack/defend patterns

## Limitations
- The approach may not scale to capture all possible attack vectors or novel threat patterns
- Effectiveness depends on stakeholders' ability to interpret and trust the structured arguments
- Maintenance overhead of updating both ontology and assurance cases as new attacks emerge is not quantified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using ontologies for knowledge representation and GSN for assurance case structuring is well-established in other domains.
- **Medium confidence**: The application to LLM adversarial robustness is novel but the underlying principles are sound and the examples provided are coherent.
- **Low confidence**: The scalability and practical usability of the approach across diverse LLM applications and stakeholder groups requires further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability test**: Implement the ontology with a broader set of attack types (beyond character perturbations and code translation) and measure query performance and maintenance effort as the knowledge base grows. Target: 50+ distinct attack-defense pairs.

2. **Stakeholder validation**: Conduct a structured evaluation with LLM developers, security analysts, and auditors to assess their ability to understand and use the assurance cases. Target: At least 10 participants from each stakeholder group.

3. **Dynamic updating experiment**: Simulate a scenario where new attack patterns emerge weekly for 8 weeks, measuring the time and effort required to update the ontology and regenerating assurance cases. Target: Complete updates within 24 hours of new attack discovery.
