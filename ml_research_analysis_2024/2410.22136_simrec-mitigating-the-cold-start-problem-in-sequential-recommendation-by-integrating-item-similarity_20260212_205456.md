# SimRec: Mitigating the Cold-Start Problem in Sequential Recommendation by Integrating Item Similarity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22136
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22136
- Authors: Shaked Brody; Shoval Lagziel
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 78% higher HR@10 compared to SASRec for cold-start items

## Executive Summary
SimRec addresses the cold-start problem in sequential recommendation by incorporating item similarities into the training process through a customized loss function. The approach leverages pre-computed text embeddings to calculate item similarities and integrates this information into the recommendation model without modifying its architecture or increasing trainable parameters. This results in a robust contextual sequential recommendation model that effectively handles rare items, including those not explicitly seen during training. Evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate SimRec's superiority, particularly for items occurring less than 10 times in the training data.

## Method Summary
SimRec integrates item similarity information into sequential recommendation training by computing pairwise item similarities using pre-trained text embeddings (specifically GTE-Large), then incorporating these similarities into a custom loss function. The method calculates a similarity distribution for each item and adds a similarity loss term to the standard recommendation loss during training. This similarity loss is implemented as cross-entropy between the model's output relevancy distribution and the similarity distribution, weighted by a scheduled parameter λ. The approach maintains the original model architecture (SASRec) while enhancing its ability to recommend similar items for cold-start scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 78% higher HR@10 compared to SASRec for cold-start items
- Outperforms strong baselines on sparse datasets while maintaining on-par performance on dense datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness particularly for items occurring less than 10 times in training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SimRec improves cold-start item recommendations by leveraging similarity distributions during training.
- Mechanism: The model computes item similarities using pre-trained text embeddings, then integrates these similarities into a custom loss function that guides the model to recommend items similar to those the user has interacted with, even if the specific cold-start item was never seen during training.
- Core assumption: Items that are textually similar share underlying user preference patterns, and the model can generalize from abundant similar items to rare ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SimRec addresses this challenge by leveraging the inherent similarity among items, incorporating item similarities into the training process through a customized loss function."
  - [section 3.1] "We employ a text embedding model [17] to represent the items and subsequently calculate the similarity between them."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations to similarity-based cold-start approaches in the corpus.
- Break condition: If item similarity does not correlate with user preference patterns, the similarity-based generalization will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The similarity loss function enables the model to rank similar items higher during inference, improving cold-start item recommendations.
- Mechanism: During training, the model optimizes for both the standard recommendation loss and a similarity loss that pushes the model to rank items similar to the ground truth item higher in the recommendation list.
- Core assumption: The similarity distribution captures meaningful relationships between items that the model can learn to exploit.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "To incorporate item similarity data, we define similarity loss as the cross-entropy loss between the model output relevancy distribution over all items and the similarity distribution."
  - [abstract] "This novel approach results in a robust contextual sequential recommendation model capable of effectively handling rare items, including those that were not explicitly seen during training."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in the corpus about similarity-based loss functions for cold-start recommendation.
- Break condition: If the similarity distribution is noisy or does not reflect true item relationships, the similarity loss may harm rather than help performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SimRec achieves significant improvements on sparse datasets because these datasets contain many rare items that are similar to more abundant items.
- Mechanism: In sparse datasets, many items have few interactions, but many of these rare items are textually similar to more abundant items. By leveraging these similarities during training, SimRec can recommend rare items based on their similarity to more abundant ones.
- Core assumption: Sparse datasets have a higher proportion of rare items that are similar to abundant items, creating opportunities for similarity-based generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "Table 1 shows an example of an item from the Amazon Beauty dataset and its most similar items. Note that while the item is relatively frequent, it is similar to rare items."
  - [section 4.2] "Figure 2 shows the performance of SimRec and SASRec on the Beauty dataset. Each point shows the HR@10 for samples in the test set where the true next item has a specific frequency."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in the corpus about the relationship between dataset sparsity and similarity-based improvements.
- Break condition: If rare items are not similar to abundant items, or if the dataset is not sparse enough to have many rare items, the similarity-based approach will not provide significant benefits.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Text embedding model (GTE-Large) -> Similarity calculation module -> Standard sequential recommendation model (SASRec) -> Custom loss function -> Linear scheduling for similarity loss weight

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-compute item similarities using text embeddings
  2. During training, compute both standard recommendation loss and similarity loss
  3. Combine losses with scheduled weighting
  4. Optimize model parameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using text embeddings for similarity vs. other modalities (images, metadata)
  - Computing all pairwise similarities (quadratic complexity) vs. approximate methods
  - Fixed similarity distributions vs. learning item similarities during training

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on cold-start items despite good overall performance
  - Model overfits to abundant items and ignores similarity information
  - Similarity distributions are too noisy or do not reflect true item relationships

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare SimRec with SASRec on a sparse dataset to verify cold-start improvements
  2. Test different text embedding models for similarity calculation to find the best one
  3. Vary the similarity threshold to find the optimal balance between noise reduction and information retention

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of similarity metric beyond text embeddings (e.g., visual features, collaborative filtering-based similarities) affect the performance of SimRec?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Notably, while we employed text for similarity calculations, our method is not limited to this modality. Without inherent constraints, our suggested loss can be applied to any modality and any similarity function."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates text-based similarities using GTE-Large and does not explore other similarity metrics or modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing SimRec's performance using different similarity metrics (visual, collaborative filtering, hybrid approaches) across various datasets and item types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the similarity threshold hyperparameter on the trade-off between cold-start performance and overall recommendation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a similarity threshold to filter out items with low similarity: "To reduce noise from less similar items, we also use similarity threshold to filter out items with low similarity."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an analysis of how different similarity threshold values affect performance, particularly the balance between cold-start improvements and general recommendation quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the similarity threshold across multiple datasets, showing the relationship between threshold values, cold-start performance gains, and overall recommendation quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SimRec perform in real-time scenarios where item similarity distributions need to be updated frequently due to new items or changing item relationships?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses computing similarities once before training but doesn't address dynamic updates: "In practical terms, it takes a relatively short time, less than 1 hour for all six tested datasets... on a typical machine."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates static datasets and doesn't explore scenarios with frequent item additions or changing item relationships that would require dynamic similarity updates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring SimRec's performance and computational overhead when item similarity distributions are updated in real-time, including latency measurements and performance degradation analysis.

## Limitations

- The quality of item similarities depends heavily on the text embedding model's ability to capture meaningful relationships between items, which may not generalize well across different domains or languages.
- The computational overhead of calculating all pairwise item similarities could be prohibitive for datasets with very large item spaces.
- The approach relies on pre-computed similarity distributions that may become outdated if item relationships change over time.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of combining standard recommendation loss with similarity-based loss is well-explained and theoretically sound. The experimental results showing consistent improvements on cold-start items are compelling.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that text embeddings effectively capture item similarity for recommendation purposes is supported by results but not extensively validated across different embedding models or item types.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that sparse datasets benefit more from this approach is supported by experimental evidence but could benefit from more analysis of why this occurs.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation:** Test SimRec on datasets from different domains (e.g., music, movies, books) to verify that text-based similarity generalizes beyond e-commerce.

2. **Embedding ablation study:** Compare performance using different text embedding models and explore whether domain-specific embeddings outperform general-purpose ones.

3. **Computational complexity analysis:** Measure the actual training time overhead and memory requirements for computing and storing all pairwise item similarities, particularly for large-scale datasets.
