# Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces Representation for Event Camera-based Continuous Dense Trajectory Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.08849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08849
- Authors: Zhongyang Zhang; Jiacheng Qiu; Shuyang Cui; Yijun Luo; Tauhidur Rahman
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Labits achieves 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error compared to state-of-the-art for event camera dense trajectory estimation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Labits (Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces), a novel representation for event camera data that captures fine-grained temporal information through a bidirectional time-surface-like structure with multiple probe time points. The method addresses the challenge of continuous dense trajectory estimation by encoding both past and future events around each probe time, enabling central difference derivative estimation for improved accuracy. A dedicated Labits-to-APLOF Net extracts active pixel local optical flow, significantly enhancing the performance of trajectory estimation.

## Method Summary
The method converts event streams into Labits representation by storing normalized time differences between probe times and the most recent past or next future events within a fixed window. This bidirectional search enables central difference derivative estimation, reducing local speed estimation error from O(δt) to O(δt²). A lightweight U-Net (Labits-to-APLOF Net) extracts active pixel local optical flow from Labits layers by focusing on high-gradient values. The Labits-RAFT model combines Labits features with APLOF features for trajectory estimation. The approach is evaluated on the MultiFlow dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in trajectory estimation accuracy.

## Key Results
- 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to previous state-of-the-art
- Achieves 0.15 TEPE and 0.46 TAE on MultiFlow dataset
- Demonstrates superior performance in continuous dense trajectory estimation for event cameras

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Labits preserves fine-grained temporal information by storing normalized time differences between probe times and nearby events. The bidirectional search ensures temporal locality and continuity by finding both past and future events around each probe time.

### Mechanism 2
Active Pixel Local Optical Flow (APLOF) is extracted by a lightweight U-Net that focuses on high-gradient Labits values. The network isolates regions with significant temporal change, predicting instantaneous optical flow only where events are active.

### Mechanism 3
Using central difference instead of backward difference in Labits reduces local speed estimation error from O(δt) to O(δt²). By considering both past and future events around each probe time, Labits enables more accurate derivative approximation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event cameras generate asynchronous events at microsecond resolution when log-intensity changes exceed a threshold.
  - Why needed here: Labits relies on precise temporal encoding; misunderstanding the asynchronous nature would lead to incorrect probe time design.
  - Quick check question: What does an event e = (t, x, y, p) represent in terms of pixel activity and polarity?

- Concept: Time surfaces encode the timestamp of the most recent event per pixel but discard older events.
  - Why needed here: Labits is a layered extension of time surfaces; understanding the limitation of single-layer time surfaces explains why Labits adds multiple probe times.
  - Quick check question: How does temporal occlusion in time surfaces limit their use for dense trajectory estimation?

- Concept: Central difference derivative approximation vs backward difference.
  - Why needed here: Labits uses bidirectional search to enable central difference, reducing estimation error.
  - Quick check question: What is the order of error in backward difference and central difference for derivative estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Event stream -> Labits generation -> Labits-to-APLOF Net -> APLOF features -> RAFT-based trajectory estimation pipeline
- Critical path: Event stream -> Labits -> Labits-to-APLOF Net -> APLOF features -> Main RAFT model -> Trajectory output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Probe time density vs. temporal resolution and computational cost
  - Single-layer vs. multi-layer input to APLOF Net (affects model generality vs. specialization)
  - Instance normalization vs. batch normalization for APLOF Net stability
- Failure signatures:
  - If Labits-to-APLOF Net outputs zero flow everywhere, check APM threshold β and event density
  - If trajectories are noisy, probe time interval τrange may be too large
  - If model training diverges, verify Labits normalization and APLOF mask alignment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate Labits generation: generate Labits from synthetic event stream and visualize probe time layers
  2. Test APLOF extraction: run Labits-to-APLOF Net on known Labits input and compare output to ground truth
  3. Ablation of bidirectional search: compare Labits with one-way Labits on trajectory error to confirm error reduction claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How well would Labits perform on tasks that do not require intermediate motion information, such as object detection or single-frame optical flow estimation? The paper acknowledges that Labits excels in dense continuous-time trajectory estimation but may not outperform established representations for tasks focused solely on final outcomes.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal method to combine Labits with traditional event representations like Voxel Grid to achieve complementary strengths? The paper suggests that Labits lacks event density information while Voxel Grid provides it but lacks fine-grained temporal precision, indicating potential for combination.

### Open Question 3
How would incorporating polarity information into Labits affect its performance in tasks where polarity is crucial? The paper mentions that Labits omits event density information for efficiency and does not differentiate between events of different polarities, suggesting potential for improvement.

### Open Question 4
Can the Labits-to-APLOF Net be effectively adapted for use with other event representations besides Labits? While the paper tests the Labits-to-APLOF Net with voxel grids, it does not explore its adaptability to a broader range of event representations or the modifications required for such adaptation.

## Limitations
- The bidirectional time surface design relies on a fixed temporal window for event lookup, which may fail in scenarios with extreme event sparsity or density
- The effectiveness of the Labits-to-APLOF Net depends on the assumption that active pixels in Labits correspond to meaningful motion, which may not hold in noisy environments
- The central difference error reduction claim assumes symmetric temporal locality of events, which may not always be true in practice

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The bidirectional time surface design improves temporal encoding accuracy by leveraging both past and future events. The ablation study on the MultiFlow dataset supports this claim.
- **Medium confidence**: The APLOF extraction using the Labits-to-APLOF Net effectively enhances trajectory estimation, though the model's generalization to unseen scenarios requires further validation.
- **Low confidence**: The error reduction from O(δt) to O(δt²) for local speed estimation is theoretically sound but may be sensitive to the choice of probe time intervals and event density.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the impact of different probe time intervals (τrange) on trajectory estimation accuracy to determine optimal settings for varying event densities
2. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing Labits with unidirectional time surfaces to isolate the contribution of bidirectional search to error reduction
3. Test the Labits-RAFT model on event streams with varying levels of noise to assess the robustness of the APLOF extraction and trajectory estimation
