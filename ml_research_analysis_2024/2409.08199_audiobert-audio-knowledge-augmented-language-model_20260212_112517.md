# AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08199
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08199
- Authors: Hyunjong Ok; Suho Yoo; Jaeho Lee
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: AudioBERT improves language model performance on auditory tasks by retrieving audio embeddings conditioned on detected auditory spans and injecting them into BERT tokens via LoRA adaptation.

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the lack of auditory commonsense knowledge in language models, which are typically pretrained on text-only datasets. To investigate this, the authors create AuditoryBench, a benchmark dataset with two tasks: animal sound recognition and sound pitch comparison. They find that popular language models like BERT, Gemma, and LLaMA perform poorly on these tasks, indicating a severe gap in auditory knowledge. To address this, the authors propose AudioBERT, a retrieval-based framework that augments language models with auditory knowledge. AudioBERT uses an auditory knowledge span detector to identify relevant text spans, retrieves corresponding audio using CLAP, and injects audio embeddings into the language model via LoRA adaptation. Experiments show that AudioBERT significantly improves performance on AuditoryBench, achieving over 40% improvement in test set accuracy compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
AudioBERT is a retrieval-based framework that augments language models with auditory knowledge. The method involves three main steps: first, detecting auditory knowledge spans in text using a transformer encoder trained to classify tokens into auditory and non-auditory categories; second, retrieving relevant audio embeddings from the LAION-Audio-630K dataset using the CLAP model based on the detected spans; and third, injecting the retrieved audio embeddings into BERT tokens via LoRA adaptation, which selectively tunes weights only when audio spans are present. The model is trained with masked language modeling loss on the AuditoryBench dataset, which consists of animal sound recognition and sound pitch comparison tasks.

## Key Results
- AudioBERT significantly improves performance on AuditoryBench tasks compared to baseline language models like BERT, Gemma, and LLaMA.
- The span detector achieves high accuracy in identifying auditory knowledge spans in text.
- CLAP effectively retrieves semantically relevant audio embeddings for the detected spans.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AudioBERT improves language model performance on auditory tasks by retrieving audio embeddings conditioned on detected auditory spans and injecting them into BERT tokens.
- Mechanism: Span detector identifies tokens requiring auditory knowledge; CLAP retrieves relevant audio embedding; LoRA adaptation enables selective weight tuning only when audio span is present.
- Core assumption: Auditory commonsense knowledge can be captured via retrieval from external audio database rather than in-model pretraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required."
  - [section] "Whenever needed, relevant audio is retrieved by querying the detected text span to CLAP... Then, the embedding of the retrieved audio sample is injected into the language model."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of retrieval-augmented approaches in nearby literature; mechanism relies on CLAP as external source.
- Break condition: If CLAP cannot find semantically relevant audio for the span, or if LoRA weights do not effectively adapt BERT for auditory reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LoRA-based adaptation preserves pretrained language model knowledge while enabling specialized auditory reasoning when needed.
- Mechanism: Standard BERT weights remain frozen; LoRA weights are only activated during inference if span detector flags auditory content, minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
- Core assumption: Low-rank decomposition of adaptation matrices is sufficient to encode task-specific auditory knowledge without full fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required... maintains its pretrained knowledge makes the model perform well in other tasks by deactivating LoRA weights."
  - [section] "Upon identification of auditory spans by the detector, the language model activates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights... while keeping the other parameters free."
  - [corpus] Weak: No explicit comparison of LoRA vs full fine-tuning in this context; assumption is standard but untested here.
- Break condition: If LoRA rank is insufficient to capture auditory knowledge, or if continual switching degrades overall model stability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Span detection pre-filtering reduces computational cost and improves retrieval relevance by narrowing the search space for CLAP.
- Mechanism: Transformer encoder classifies tokens into auditory/non-auditory spans; only spans labeled auditory are passed to CLAP, avoiding unnecessary audio retrieval.
- Core assumption: Most tokens in language tasks do not require auditory knowledge; targeted retrieval is more efficient than unconditional retrieval.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently."
  - [section] "This model extracts the audio-relevant span from the given text... we simply train a transformer encoder to classify the auditory knowledge span from other tokens."
  - [corpus] Weak: No explicit evidence that span detection improves latency or accuracy; assumption inferred from design description.
- Break condition: If span detector has high false negative rate, auditory knowledge will be missed; if high false positive rate, unnecessary CLAP calls degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
  - Why needed here: BERT is pretrained via MLM, so LoRA fine-tuning must also respect MLM objective to maintain generalization.
  - Quick check question: What loss function does BERT use during pretraining, and why is it important for LoRA fine-tuning?

- Concept: Contrastive Learning (CLAP)
  - Why needed here: CLAP's audio-text similarity model enables retrieval of relevant audio embeddings based on textual queries.
  - Quick check question: How does CLAP's loss function align audio and text representations in the embedding space?

- Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: LoRA allows parameter-efficient adaptation of large models without overwriting original weights.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical form of LoRA weight decomposition, and how does it reduce parameter count?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input prompt → Span detector (BERT-based) → If auditory span detected → CLAP query (text encoder) → CLAP retrieval (audio encoder) → Audio embedding → LoRA-activated BERT (MLM loss) → Output
- Critical path: Span detection → CLAP retrieval → Audio embedding injection → LoRA fine-tuning
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Retrieval-based vs in-model pretraining: Retrieval allows dynamic knowledge updates but adds inference latency; in-model pretraining would be static but faster.
  - LoRA rank selection: Higher rank improves adaptation capacity but increases parameters and risk of overfitting; lower rank is more efficient but may underfit.
- Failure signatures:
  - Span detector misses auditory spans → No audio retrieval → BERT answers incorrectly on auditory tasks.
  - CLAP retrieval returns irrelevant audio → Injected embedding misleads BERT → Performance degrades.
  - LoRA weights not properly initialized or trained → Adaptation fails → No improvement over baseline.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate span detector accuracy on held-out auditory vs non-auditory spans; measure precision/recall.
  2. Test CLAP retrieval relevance by checking if retrieved audio semantically matches the query span; compute cosine similarity.
  3. Compare LoRA vs full fine-tuning on AuditoryBench dev set; measure accuracy gain and parameter efficiency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can AudioBERT be effectively extended to handle more complex auditory tasks beyond animal sound recognition and pitch comparison, such as identifying specific environmental sounds or distinguishing between different musical instruments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates AudioBERT's effectiveness on two specific tasks but does not explore its performance on more diverse or complex auditory tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on two relatively simple auditory tasks, leaving the model's capability for more complex auditory understanding untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing AudioBERT on a broader range of auditory tasks, including those involving environmental sounds, musical instrument identification, and more nuanced audio distinctions, would provide insights into its generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of AudioBERT compare to other multimodal models that integrate auditory information, such as Pengi, in terms of accuracy and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces AudioBERT as a novel approach but does not provide a direct comparison with other existing multimodal models that incorporate auditory knowledge.
- Why unresolved: Without comparative analysis, it is unclear how AudioBERT stacks up against other state-of-the-art multimodal models in terms of performance and resource efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that compare AudioBERT with other multimodal models on the same tasks would highlight its relative strengths and weaknesses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of the auditory knowledge span detector in AudioBERT, and how might these affect the model's performance in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes the auditory knowledge span detector as a component of AudioBERT but does not thoroughly explore its limitations or potential failure modes.
- Why unresolved: The detector's accuracy and robustness in identifying relevant auditory spans in diverse contexts are not fully examined, which could impact the model's practical utility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the detector's performance across varied and noisy datasets, and identifying specific scenarios where it fails, would clarify its limitations and guide improvements.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the inclusion of auditory knowledge in language models like AudioBERT affect their performance on non-auditory tasks, and is there a trade-off between specialized auditory understanding and general language comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on enhancing auditory knowledge but does not investigate the broader impact on the model's overall language capabilities.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear whether augmenting language models with auditory knowledge could inadvertently impair their performance on tasks that do not require such information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating AudioBERT on a suite of non-auditory language tasks would reveal any trade-offs or impacts on general language understanding.

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide a direct comparison with other multimodal models that integrate auditory information, making it unclear how AudioBERT performs relative to existing approaches.
- The effectiveness of the auditory knowledge span detector is not thoroughly evaluated, with no reported precision/recall metrics to quantify its accuracy in identifying relevant spans.
- The reliance on CLAP for audio retrieval introduces a dependency on the quality and coverage of the LAION-Audio-630K dataset, which could limit the model's performance if the dataset lacks relevant audio samples for certain auditory concepts.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The experimental results showing AudioBERT's performance improvement on AuditoryBench tasks are directly measured and reported with specific accuracy metrics. The methodology of using retrieval-based audio augmentation is technically sound and well-described.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that AudioBERT maintains pretrained knowledge in non-auditory tasks while specializing in auditory tasks is supported by design but not empirically validated through comprehensive testing across diverse NLP benchmarks.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that auditory commonsense knowledge cannot be captured through text-only pretraining is reasonable but not conclusively proven, as the paper does not explore alternative approaches like audio-augmented pretraining or contrastive learning during initial training.

## Next Checks

1. **Span Detector Evaluation**: Measure precision, recall, and F1-score of the auditory knowledge span detector on a held-out test set to quantify its effectiveness in identifying relevant tokens that require audio knowledge.

2. **CLAP Retrieval Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the semantic relevance of audio samples retrieved by CLAP for various auditory spans using human evaluation or automated metrics like cosine similarity between query and retrieved audio embeddings.

3. **Ablation Study on LoRA Configuration**: Systematically vary LoRA rank and alpha parameters to determine their impact on AuditoryBench performance and identify optimal configuration values for the task.
