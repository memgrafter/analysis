# A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22377
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive taxonomy and synthesis of 156 spatio-temporal GNN models for time series analysis across 7 application domains

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review examines the state-of-the-art in spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) for time series analysis, focusing on classification and forecasting tasks. The review synthesizes 156 journal articles, covering diverse application domains such as energy, environment, finance, health, mobility, and predictive monitoring. It provides a comprehensive taxonomy of ST-GNN models, highlighting the prevalent use of convolutional and attentional spatial modules. The review identifies common benchmark datasets and models, and discusses challenges such as comparability, reproducibility, and explainability.

## Method Summary
The review employs a systematic literature review methodology using four major academic databases (Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and ACM) with a structured query to capture relevant papers. A multi-stage filtering process removes duplicates, screens titles/abstracts, and performs full-text analysis to ensure comprehensive and unbiased coverage. Papers are then categorized by application domain and analyzed for model architecture, graph construction methods, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive taxonomy of ST-GNN models based on spatial aggregation mechanisms (recurrent, convolutional, attentional)
- Analysis of graph construction methods showing predominance of predefined structures with learned structures emerging
- Identification of reproducibility challenges, with only 19.2% of papers providing source code links

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The systematic literature review methodology ensures comprehensive and unbiased coverage of spatio-temporal GNN research by using structured database searches and exclusion criteria.
- Mechanism: The SLR uses four major academic databases with a carefully designed query, followed by multi-stage filtering to reduce selection bias.
- Core assumption: The search query is broad enough to capture relevant studies while being specific enough to exclude unrelated work.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field."
  - "An advanced search query submitted to the databases was designed to capture the breadth of the topic while maintaining specificity."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The taxonomy of spatio-temporal GNNs based on spatial aggregation mechanisms provides a clear framework for categorizing and comparing different model approaches.
- Mechanism: The review defines three primary classes of spatial modules that propagate information within nodes at fixed time steps.
- Core assumption: The spatial aggregation mechanism is the most fundamental distinguishing feature of spatio-temporal GNN models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Based on the mechanism at the basis of the information propagation in the graph at a given time step, spatio-temporal GNNs can be further classified as recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, and attentional GNNs."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The comprehensive results tables and dataset benchmarks enable researchers to compare model performance across different application domains.
- Mechanism: The review collects and synthesizes results from 156 papers, organizing them by application domain with performance metrics and datasets.
- Core assumption: Performance metrics and datasets are reported consistently enough across papers to enable meaningful comparison.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph neural networks and their basic mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GNNs process graph-structured data is essential for grasping spatio-temporal extensions
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between message passing in GNNs and traditional neural networks?

- Concept: Time series analysis and forecasting techniques
  - Why needed here: The review focuses on applying GNNs to time series problems, requiring understanding of both domains
  - Quick check question: How do univariate and multivariate time series differ in terms of the data structure they represent?

- Concept: Systematic literature review methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper's contribution relies on proper SLR techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage
  - Quick check question: What are the key steps in conducting a systematic literature review to minimize selection bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Database search -> Paper screening -> Taxonomy application -> Results collection -> Synthesis and comparison
- Critical path: Database search → Paper screening → Taxonomy application → Results collection → Synthesis and comparison
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth: Including many papers provides comprehensive coverage but may sacrifice detailed analysis of individual models
  - Standardization vs. flexibility: Using consistent metrics enables comparison but may not capture domain-specific nuances
  - Temporal coverage: Focusing on recent papers captures current trends but may miss foundational work
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent results across papers suggest methodological issues or domain-specific factors
  - Lack of common benchmark datasets indicates fragmentation in the research community
  - Missing source code links hinder reproducibility and verification of results
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the SLR methodology on a smaller subset of papers to verify the multi-stage filtering process
  2. Apply the taxonomy to a new spatio-temporal GNN paper not included in the review to test classification framework
  3. Select one application domain and attempt to reproduce results from multiple papers using their reported datasets and metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal graph construction methods for different time series domains (e.g., mobility vs. environment vs. finance)?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that graph structure determination is crucial and varies by domain, with some domains having natural graph structures while others require manual definition or learned structures.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows diverse approaches but doesn't establish which graph construction methods work best for specific domains or data characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison studies testing multiple graph construction methods across similar datasets from different domains, with clear performance metrics and ablation studies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can spatio-temporal GNN models achieve better scalability for real-time applications with large-scale dynamic graphs?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies scalability as a key challenge, noting that GNNs require significant memory for adjacency matrix computation and node embeddings, especially with dynamic structures.
- Why unresolved: Current solutions focus on specific architectural improvements but lack comprehensive frameworks for balancing accuracy and computational efficiency in real-time scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark studies comparing different scaling techniques on identical large-scale datasets with strict latency requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What explainability methods can effectively interpret decision-making in spatio-temporal GNN models while preserving their performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies explainability as a limitation, noting that GNNs are often "black box" models despite their ability to model spatial relationships.
- Why unresolved: Current explainability approaches have limitations in effectiveness or computational cost, and no comprehensive framework exists for spatio-temporal GNNs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of explainability methods on identical spatio-temporal GNN models, measuring both interpretability quality and performance impact.

## Limitations
- Potential coverage gaps in non-indexed sources or emerging terminology not captured by the search query
- Inconsistent reporting of experimental details and hyperparameters across papers affecting reproducibility assessment
- Only 19.2% of papers provided source code links, limiting verification of reported results

## Confidence

- Systematic methodology and coverage: Medium
- Taxonomy validity and framework: High
- Comparative performance claims: Low-Medium (due to inconsistent metrics)
- Dataset and benchmark identification: High

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the database search and screening process on a random sample of 20 papers to verify the multi-stage filtering methodology and identify potential coverage gaps.
2. Apply the spatio-temporal GNN taxonomy to 5 recent papers not included in the review to test the framework's extensibility and identify any missing categories.
3. Select one application domain (e.g., traffic forecasting) and attempt to reproduce results from 3 papers using their reported datasets and metrics to assess comparability and reproducibility challenges.
