# Are Expert-Level Language Models Expert-Level Annotators?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.03254
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03254
- Authors: Yu-Min Tseng; Wei-Lin Chen; Chung-Chi Chen; Hsin-Hsi Chen
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: LLMs achieve 32-43% of expert annotator accuracy in specialized domains

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as expert-level data annotators across specialized domains including finance, biomedicine, and law. The authors test four state-of-the-art LLM models using six existing expert-annotated datasets and various prompting techniques including chain-of-thought, self-consistency, self-refine, and a multi-agent framework with peer discussion. While LLMs significantly lag behind human experts in annotation accuracy, the study reveals that their collective performance combined with substantially lower costs presents a promising human-LLM hybrid annotation approach for the future.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLM annotation performance using six expert-annotated datasets across three domains. The authors employ instruction-based prompting with annotation guidelines and data instances, testing four LLM models (GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus) with five different approaches: vanilla, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, self-refine, and a multi-agent framework. Performance is measured by comparing LLM-generated annotations against human expert labels, with cost-effectiveness analysis based on assumed API pricing.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve only 32-43% of expert annotator accuracy under naive prompting
- Prompt engineering techniques provide modest improvements of 1-2% accuracy
- Multi-agent frameworks slightly outperform single-LLM settings but increase costs
- Combined LLM performance exceeds 50% accuracy, suggesting hybrid approaches are promising
- GPT-4o and Claude-3-Opus outperform lower-cost models but at significantly higher expense

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can serve as annotation tools when domain knowledge is encoded in their parameters
- Mechanism: Large language models trained on diverse text corpora encode substantial domain-specific knowledge that can be accessed through appropriate prompting
- Core assumption: The parametric knowledge in LLMs sufficiently covers the specialized domains needed for annotation tasks
- Evidence anchors: Abstract statement about domain-specific knowledge, relation categorization requirements, but weak support from general survey papers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt engineering techniques can improve LLM annotation accuracy in specialized domains
- Mechanism: Chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and self-refine prompting methods help LLMs better access and apply their encoded knowledge to annotation tasks
- Core assumption: LLMs possess the necessary knowledge but need better access methods to apply it correctly
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions prompting techniques, section shows 1-2% accuracy gains, but lacks specific corpus evidence

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-agent discussion frameworks can improve annotation consistency through consensus building
- Mechanism: Multiple LLM agents can discuss disagreements and reach consensus similar to human annotation teams, potentially improving accuracy
- Core assumption: LLMs can engage in productive discussion that leads to better annotations than individual models
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describes multi-agent framework, section shows modest improvements, but relevant corpus papers focus on reasoning rather than annotation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: Helps LLMs break down complex annotation tasks into manageable reasoning steps
  - Quick check question: How does adding "Let's think step by step" to prompts affect annotation accuracy in expert domains?

- Concept: Self-consistency sampling
  - Why needed here: Generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer to improve reliability
  - Quick check question: What is the impact of temperature 0.7 sampling on annotation consistency across multiple runs?

- Concept: Multi-agent consensus mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Mimics human annotation workflows where multiple reviewers discuss and agree on labels
  - Quick check question: How does the maximum discussion round parameter affect final annotation accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data loading pipeline -> LLM interface layer -> Prompt template system -> Evaluation framework -> Cost tracking module
- Critical path: Load dataset → Format instance with guideline → Apply prompting method → Generate annotation → Compare with ground truth → Calculate metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Higher cost models (GPT-4o) provide better accuracy but lower cost models (GPT-3.5) are more economical; multi-agent approaches improve consistency but increase cost
- Failure signatures: Accuracy plateauing below human expert levels despite prompt engineering; inconsistent results across model runs; discussion rounds failing to reach consensus
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run vanilla prompting on all datasets with GPT-4o to establish baseline accuracy
  2. Apply chain-of-thought prompting to same datasets to measure improvement
  3. Implement self-consistency with 5 samples to evaluate if majority voting improves results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific prompting strategies could further improve LLM performance on expert-level annotation tasks?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper notes that their results "may further benefit from a more exhaustive prompt optimization" and acknowledges that "some works have demonstrated that, for specific scenarios, one can achieve sizable improvement through carefully-crafted prompts."
- Why unresolved: The authors deliberately minimized prompt engineering efforts to provide "direct insight and observation" on out-of-the-box performance, leaving room for improvement through prompt optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing various prompt engineering techniques (few-shot examples, template variations, persona prompts, etc.) against the current baseline results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would LLM performance differ on natural language generation (NLG) tasks compared to the natural language understanding (NLU) tasks evaluated in this study?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The authors explicitly state this as a limitation: "Another potential limitation is that we primarily focus on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks with fixed label space. Towards a more comprehensive evaluation, natural language generation (NLG) tasks could be further incorporated."
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated NLU tasks with discrete label spaces, leaving the question of how LLMs would perform on open-ended generation tasks unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of LLM performance on both NLU and NLG expert annotation tasks across the same domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific knowledge gaps that prevent LLMs from achieving expert-level performance on specialized domain annotation tasks?
- Basis in paper: Inferred - The paper observes that "solely relying on the parametric knowledge in LLMs to perform domain-specific, expert-level annotation tasks is non-trivial" and that "the models inherently lack necessary knowledge and reasoning capability."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates performance gaps, it doesn't identify which specific types of domain knowledge or reasoning capabilities are most lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis identifying patterns in LLM mistakes across different types of domain knowledge (terminology, relationships, contextual understanding, etc.).

## Limitations

- Dataset representativeness: Only six datasets across three domains limit generalizability to other specialized fields
- Cost-effectiveness analysis limitations: Static pricing assumptions don't account for real-world fluctuations or hidden costs
- Generalization across domains: Performance gaps vary significantly, but systematic analysis of predictive domain characteristics is missing

## Confidence

**High confidence (4-5)**: The fundamental finding that LLMs achieve 32-43% of human expert accuracy in annotation tasks is well-supported by systematic evaluation across multiple datasets and models.

**Medium confidence (2-3)**: The claim about cost-effectiveness of human-LLM hybrid approaches is reasonable but depends on future pricing models and implementation details not fully explored in the paper.

**Low confidence (0-1)**: The paper's suggestion that LLMs could replace human annotators in some scenarios appears premature given the significant accuracy gap and lack of systematic analysis of error patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate the same prompting methods on annotation datasets from additional domains (e.g., technical documentation, social media analysis, or scientific literature) to assess whether performance patterns hold beyond the three tested domains.

2. **Error pattern analysis**: Conduct a systematic error analysis comparing LLM vs. human annotations to identify whether errors are random or follow predictable patterns. This would inform whether LLMs could serve as effective pre-annotation tools that humans review rather than primary annotators.

3. **Longitudinal cost modeling**: Track actual API costs and model performance over time as LLMs continue to improve, comparing the total cost of ownership (including prompt engineering and quality control) against traditional human annotation workflows.
