# Using Multimodal Deep Neural Networks to Disentangle Language from Visual Aesthetics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.23603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23603
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Unimodal vision models explain most variance in beauty ratings; language adds little

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether aesthetic experiences arise from perceptual or linguistic processes by predicting human beauty ratings using deep neural networks. The authors employ linear decoding over representations from unimodal vision, unimodal language, and multimodal models. Their findings reveal that perceptual representations from vision models account for the vast majority of explainable variance in beauty ratings, with minimal additional contribution from language models. This suggests that feedforward perceptual computations provide a sufficient foundation for aesthetic experiences, while linguistic processes play a secondary role.

## Method Summary
The authors collected human beauty ratings for facial images and used linear decoders to predict these ratings from representations learned by various deep neural networks. They tested unimodal vision models (SimCLR), multimodal vision models (SLIP), and unimodal language models conditioned on visual embeddings. The approach involved freezing pre-trained model representations and training linear classifiers to predict beauty ratings, allowing them to isolate the contribution of different representational spaces to aesthetic judgment.

## Key Results
- Unimodal vision models (SimCLR) explain the vast majority of variance in beauty ratings
- Multimodal vision models (SLIP) provide only small additional gains
- Language models conditioned on visual embeddings do not improve prediction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that feedforward perceptual computations in vision systems capture the essential features needed for aesthetic judgments, while language processing provides minimal additional information. This suggests that aesthetic experiences are primarily grounded in low-level visual features and their higher-order combinations, rather than abstract linguistic concepts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear decoding**: Simple linear models trained on neural representations to predict behavioral outcomes; needed because it isolates representational contributions without introducing nonlinear model complexity; quick check: verify decoding performance matches original results
- **Transfer learning with frozen representations**: Using pre-trained models without fine-tuning to assess inherent representational properties; needed to ensure findings reflect model architecture rather than task-specific training; quick check: confirm representations remain stable across runs
- **Multimodal model architectures**: Vision-language models that jointly process visual and textual information; needed to test whether integrated representations improve aesthetic prediction; quick check: compare unimodal vs multimodal performance directly
- **Explainable variance**: Statistical measure of how much variance in ratings can be accounted for by model predictions; needed to quantify the relative contributions of different representational spaces; quick check: calculate variance explained using different decoding approaches
- **Unimodal vs multimodal representations**: Comparing single-modality models to models that integrate multiple input types; needed to test whether combining modalities provides synergistic benefits; quick check: ensure fair comparison by matching model sizes

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Visual stimuli → Vision models (SimCLR, SLIP) → Linear decoders → Beauty ratings; Visual stimuli → Language models → Linear decoders → Beauty ratings; Visual stimuli → Multimodal models → Linear decoders → Beauty ratings
- **Critical path**: Visual input → Vision model representations → Linear decoder → Beauty prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using frozen pre-trained models trades task-specific optimization for generalizability and interpretability of representational contributions
- **Failure signatures**: If language models perform well, this would suggest aesthetic judgments rely more on linguistic processing than visual features
- **First experiments**: (1) Replicate unimodal vision model performance; (2) Test multimodal vision models for additional gains; (3) Evaluate language models conditioned on visual features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings may not generalize to aesthetic judgments beyond beauty ratings
- Pre-trained model architectures may introduce biases affecting perceptual vs linguistic interpretation
- Individual differences in linguistic abilities or aesthetic expertise were not controlled for
- Linear decoding may miss nonlinear interactions between perceptual and linguistic representations

## Confidence
- **High**: Feedforward perceptual computations provide sufficient foundation for aesthetic experiences
- **Medium**: Language plays a secondary role in aesthetic experiences
- **Low**: Broader claims about brain architecture of aesthetic processing

## Next Checks
1. Replicate analysis using different types of aesthetic judgments (artistic preference, architectural beauty)
2. Test fine-tuned vision-language models on aesthetic rating task versus frozen representations
3. Conduct neuroimaging studies to directly compare neural representations of perceptual and linguistic contributions to aesthetic experiences
