- This survey comprehensively reviews methods integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with 3D data to advance spatial understanding and interaction in embodied AI.

## Executive Summary
This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of methods integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with 3D data, focusing on how multi-modal LLMs can enhance spatial understanding and reasoning in embodied AI. The paper establishes a taxonomy of approaches based on LLMs' roles - from enhancing 3D tasks through world knowledge to acting as embodied agents. It details various 3D representations (point clouds, voxels, meshes, neural fields), tokenization strategies, and alignment architectures that enable LLMs to process 3D spatial information. The survey identifies key challenges including the need for 3D-centric pretraining, dynamic geometric reasoning, robust evaluation, and safety considerations for embodied agents. By synthesizing existing research, datasets, and benchmarking results, it provides a roadmap for future exploration in 3D-LLMs.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews approaches for integrating LLMs with 3D data through a comprehensive literature analysis. It examines various 3D representations (point clouds, voxels, meshes, neural fields, NeRFs) and how they can be processed by LLMs. The paper details tokenization strategies that convert 3D structures into formats compatible with LLMs, including point cloud voxelization, mesh representation via keypoints and triangles, and neural field sampling. Alignment architectures are categorized into four types: 3D-only encoders, 3D+text encoders, Q-Former style encoders, and text-only encoders with 3D-specific pretraining. Fine-tuning methods include LoRA, adaptive fine-tuning, layer freezing, and prompt tuning. The survey evaluates these approaches across multiple tasks including captioning, grounding, question answering, embodied agents, and generation, providing a meta-analysis of their capabilities and limitations.

## Key Results
- Established taxonomy of 3D-LLM approaches based on LLMs' roles: enhancing 3D tasks, enabling multi-task learning, serving as multimodal interfaces, acting as embodied agents, and assisting 3D generation
- Identified major challenges including need for 3D-centric pretraining, dynamic geometric reasoning, robust evaluation, and safety for embodied agents
- Synthesized existing research, datasets, and benchmarking results to provide roadmap for future 3D-LLM exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
3D-LLMs work by bridging the gap between spatial data structures and language understanding through specialized alignment architectures. The mechanism involves converting native 3D representations (point clouds, meshes, neural fields) into token sequences that LLMs can process, while preserving spatial relationships and geometric information. This is achieved through tokenization strategies that encode 3D structures into discrete tokens, followed by alignment modules that project these features into the LLM's input space. Fine-tuning strategies then adapt pre-trained LLMs to understand and reason about 3D spatial concepts by training on 3D-text paired data. The effectiveness stems from LLMs' ability to leverage their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities to enhance 3D understanding, while 3D data provides the spatial grounding necessary for grounded reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- 3D Data Representations: Point clouds, voxels, meshes, neural fields, and NeRFs each have distinct properties affecting how spatial information is encoded and processed
  * Why needed: Different 3D tasks require different representations for optimal performance
  * Quick check: Verify understanding by explaining advantages/disadvantages of each representation type

- Tokenization Strategies: Methods for converting 3D structures into LLM-compatible token sequences
  * Why needed: LLMs require discrete token inputs, necessitating conversion from continuous 3D data
  * Quick check: Understand how point cloud voxelization differs from mesh representation tokenization

- Alignment Architectures: Various approaches for connecting 3D encoders to LLMs (3D-only, 3D+text, Q-Former, text-only)
  * Why needed: Proper alignment preserves spatial information while enabling language understanding
  * Quick check: Compare how different alignment architectures handle geometric vs semantic information

- Fine-tuning Methods: Techniques like LoRA, adaptive fine-tuning, layer freezing, and prompt tuning for adapting LLMs to 3D tasks
  * Why needed: Efficiently adapt large pre-trained models to 3D understanding without full retraining
  * Quick check: Understand computational and performance tradeoffs between different fine-tuning approaches

- Embodied AI Integration: How 3D-LLMs enable agents to perceive, reason about, and interact with 3D environments
  * Why needed: Critical for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and interactive environments
  * Quick check: Identify safety considerations when LLMs generate physical actions for embodied agents

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: 3D Data -> Tokenizer -> Alignment Module -> LLM -> Task-specific Head -> Output

Critical path: 3D Data -> Tokenizer -> Alignment Module -> LLM (fine-tuned) -> Output
The critical path involves converting raw 3D data through tokenization, aligning it with LLM input space, fine-tuning the LLM on 3D tasks, and producing task-specific outputs. Each component must preserve spatial information while enabling language understanding.

Design tradeoffs:
- Spatial preservation vs computational efficiency in tokenization
- Fine-tuning vs inference speed tradeoffs in alignment modules
- Task-specific specialization vs multi-task generalization
- Safety constraints vs reasoning capability in embodied agent applications

Failure signatures:
- Loss of geometric information during tokenization/alignment
- Hallucinations in spatial reasoning and understanding
- Poor generalization across different 3D representations
- Safety issues in physical action generation for embodied agents

First experiments:
1. Implement basic 3D point cloud captioning using point cloud voxelization and linear alignment
2. Compare different tokenization strategies (voxelization vs neural field sampling) on simple shape classification
3. Evaluate safety constraints in embodied agent action generation using synthetic 3D environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we effectively design 3D-centric pretraining objectives that preserve spatial structure better than current alignment modules that reduce 3D to 1D tokens?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.2 discusses the need to move from text-only pretrained LLMs with 3D encoders to 3D-centric pretraining that treats 3D structure as first-class representation
- Why unresolved: Current methods rely on frozen 3D encoders and alignment modules that project native 3D features to 1D tokens, leading to substantial spatial information loss
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of joint 3D-LLM pretraining with geometric consistency objectives, masked autoencoding in 3D token space, and ablation studies showing performance improvements over current alignment-based approaches

### Open Question 2
What evaluation metrics can reliably detect hallucinations in 3D-LLM outputs and ensure genuine spatial understanding rather than linguistic pattern matching?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.6 highlights that current VQA-style evaluations measure only text-level similarity scores without testing actual 3D-grounded understanding
- Why unresolved: Existing metrics fail to distinguish between correct answers from spatial reasoning versus those derived from exploiting linguistic priors
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of evaluation protocols that require explicit 3D grounding verification, metrics that penalize ungrounded reasoning, and experimental validation showing current methods fail on systematically designed hallucination tests

### Open Question 3
How can we scale 3D-text paired data acquisition to match the billions of image-text pairs available for 2D VLMs while maintaining fine-grained spatial-semantic alignment?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.5 identifies the massive scale difference between existing 3D vision-language datasets (millions of pairs) versus 2D image-text datasets (billions of pairs) as a fundamental bottleneck
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests synthetic data generation and automated annotation as promising directions, it doesn't provide concrete strategies for achieving the required scale
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of 3D-text dataset scaling approaches that achieve order-of-magnitude increases in data volume while maintaining or improving fine-grained alignment quality

## Limitations
- The rapidly evolving nature of this field means some recent approaches may not be fully captured
- Meta-analysis relies heavily on reported results from individual studies, which may use different evaluation protocols and datasets
- Focuses primarily on technical methodologies while touching less deeply on practical deployment considerations and real-world performance in embodied AI scenarios

## Confidence
- The taxonomy of 3D-LLM approaches and their applications: High confidence - well-supported by existing literature
- The identified challenges (geometric reasoning, evaluation, safety): High confidence - these are widely recognized issues in the field
- The proposed roadmap for future research: Medium confidence - while logical, the actual trajectory depends on technical breakthroughs not yet achieved

## Next Checks
1. Cross-reference the survey's performance claims with original papers to verify consistency in evaluation metrics and reported results
2. Validate the survey's classification of alignment architectures by implementing a representative subset and testing their performance on common 3D tasks
3. Assess the practical limitations of current 3D-LLM approaches by attempting to deploy selected methods on embodied AI platforms to test safety and real-world robustness claims
