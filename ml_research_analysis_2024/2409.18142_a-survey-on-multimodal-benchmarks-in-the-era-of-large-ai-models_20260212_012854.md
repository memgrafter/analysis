# A Survey on Multimodal Benchmarks: In the Era of Large AI Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18142
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18142
- Authors: Lin Li; Guikun Chen; Hanrong Shi; Jun Xiao; Long Chen
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This survey systematically reviews 211 multimodal benchmarks across understanding, reasoning, generation, and application domains, addressing the gap in comprehensive benchmarking analysis for MLLMs.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of 211 multimodal benchmarks designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It systematically categorizes benchmarks into four core domains: understanding, reasoning, generation, and application, offering a structured framework for researchers to navigate the evolving landscape of MLLM evaluation. The paper highlights key challenges such as task saturation, inconsistent metrics, and the need for more universal representation learning approaches. By detailing task designs, evaluation metrics, and dataset construction methods, this work serves as a valuable guide for advancing MLLM benchmarking practices.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic review approach to analyze 211 multimodal benchmarks, categorizing them into four primary domains: understanding, reasoning, generation, and application. Each domain is further explored through task design and evaluation metric analysis, with specific attention to dataset construction methods including collection and quality control processes. The methodology involves mapping benchmarks to their respective categories, analyzing their task formats and evaluation approaches, and identifying patterns and gaps in current benchmarking practices.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of 211 multimodal benchmarks into understanding, reasoning, generation, and application domains
- Detailed analysis of task formats (binary/multiple choice, defined form, free form) and their corresponding evaluation metrics
- Identification of future research directions including universal representation learning, real-time response evaluation, and human-in-the-loop assessment methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Categorization of 211 benchmarks into four core domains (understanding, reasoning, generation, application) enables systematic navigation of the MLLM evaluation landscape.
- Mechanism: The taxonomy provides a unified framework that reduces fragmentation by grouping benchmarks based on their primary evaluation focus, making it easier to identify gaps and overlaps.
- Core assumption: The four-domain categorization captures the essential capabilities that need to be evaluated in MLLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey addresses this gap by systematically reviewing 211 benchmarks that assess MLLMs across four core domains: understanding, reasoning, generation, and application."
  - [section] "We categorize existing benchmarks into five distinct groups based on their primary focus."
- Break condition: If MLLM capabilities evolve beyond these four domains or if the categorization fails to capture emerging evaluation needs, the framework would need revision.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Detailed task and metric design for each benchmark category ensures comprehensive evaluation coverage across different output formats and capabilities.
- Mechanism: By specifying task types (binary/multiple choice, defined form, free form) and corresponding metrics, the survey provides a standardized approach to evaluating diverse MLLM outputs.
- Core assumption: Different task formats require distinct evaluation metrics to accurately assess model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "This chapter introduces the design of tasks and evaluation metrics related to each generation capabilities."
  - [section] "The multimodal task and metric design of understanding benchmarks is structured around two main dimensions: capability-oriented task and metric that measure specific competencies, and format-oriented metrics that ensure the evaluation is aligned with the type of output generated."
- Break condition: If new task formats emerge that don't fit existing metric categories, or if current metrics prove insufficient for evaluating complex MLLM outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dataset construction guidelines (collection methods and quality control) ensure benchmark reliability and reduce data leakage risks.
- Mechanism: The survey outlines specific dataset collection approaches (manual craft, automated rules, LLM-based generation) and quality control methods (manual filter, rule-based filter, LLM-based filter) to maintain data integrity.
- Core assumption: High-quality, unbiased datasets are essential for valid benchmark evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Quality control is essential in ensuring the reliability and integrity of datasets used in training and evaluating MLLMs."
  - [section] "Various methods, ranging from manual curation to automated filtering, help eliminate errors, redundancies, and irrelevant data."
- Break condition: If new data collection methods or quality control techniques prove more effective, or if current methods fail to prevent sophisticated data leakage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding MLLMs is fundamental to grasping why comprehensive benchmarking is necessary and how different benchmarks evaluate various aspects of these models.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between traditional LLMs and MLLMs in terms of input/output modalities?

- Concept: Benchmark categorization and taxonomy design
  - Why needed here: The ability to categorize and organize benchmarks is crucial for understanding the survey's structure and the rationale behind grouping benchmarks into specific domains.
  - Quick check question: How does the four-domain categorization (understanding, reasoning, generation, application) help in systematically evaluating MLLMs?

- Concept: Task format and evaluation metric relationships
  - Why needed here: Understanding the relationship between different task formats and their corresponding evaluation metrics is essential for interpreting benchmark results and designing new evaluations.
  - Quick check question: Why are different evaluation metrics used for binary/multiple choice tasks versus free-form tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The survey architecture consists of four main sections (Understanding, Reasoning, Generation, Application), each containing background taxonomy, task design, and metric design subsections. Cross-cutting elements include dataset construction and future research directions.
- Critical path: Start with understanding benchmarks to grasp basic MLLM capabilities, progress to reasoning for complex cognitive tasks, then generation for creative outputs, and finally application for real-world scenarios. Dataset construction is critical throughout.
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive coverage vs. manageable scope - the survey includes 211 benchmarks but organizes them into a navigable structure. Detailed task descriptions vs. brevity - provides specific task and metric information while maintaining overview status.
- Failure signatures: If benchmarks become outdated faster than the survey can be updated, or if new MLLM capabilities emerge that don't fit existing categories, the framework may become less useful.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Map a new MLLM benchmark to the appropriate category in the four-domain taxonomy to test the classification system's effectiveness.
  2. Select a benchmark from each domain and verify that its task format and evaluation metrics align with the survey's guidelines.
  3. Apply the dataset construction methods (collection and quality control) to a new benchmark to assess their practical applicability and identify any gaps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific evaluation metrics or methodologies can be developed to assess "any-to-any" modality transfers in multimodal large language models, and how would these differ from current task-specific benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "any-to-any" modality transfer as a future research direction, noting that current benchmarks have rigidly predetermined input/output modality combinations, unlike human-level intelligence which adapts to various modalities seamlessly.
- Why unresolved: The paper only identifies this as a gap but does not propose specific metrics or methodologies for evaluating such flexible modality transfers across diverse combinations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that test MLLMs' ability to process and generate across all possible modality combinations, with benchmark datasets specifically designed for "any-to-any" modality tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can universal representation learning be effectively implemented and evaluated across all modalities in multimodal large language models, and what architectural changes would this require?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights universal representation learning as a key future direction, noting that current benchmarks encourage specialized representations for each modality rather than exploring underlying uniformity across modalities.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this as important, it does not specify how to implement or evaluate such universal representations, nor what architectural modifications would be necessary.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of MLLM architectures capable of learning shared representations across text, image, audio, and other modalities, along with new benchmarks that evaluate cross-modal understanding and translation capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What methodologies can be developed to integrate real-time response evaluation into multimodal large language model benchmarks, and how would timing constraints affect model design?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies real-time response as a critical future direction, noting that current benchmarks overlook temporal aspects and timing constraints that are crucial for applications like voice assistants and autonomous vehicles.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions this as a need but does not propose specific methodologies for incorporating timing constraints into benchmark design or how this would influence model development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation of benchmark suites that include strict timing requirements for various tasks, along with studies demonstrating how timing constraints affect MLLM performance and architecture optimization for speed.

## Limitations

- The rapid evolution of MLLMs may render some benchmarks outdated quickly, limiting the survey's long-term relevance
- The four-domain categorization may not fully capture emerging evaluation needs as MLLM capabilities expand beyond current boundaries
- The survey relies on published benchmark descriptions, which may not reveal implementation details or practical challenges encountered during evaluation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The systematic categorization of benchmarks and the identification of task formats and evaluation metrics are well-supported by the survey's methodology and evidence.
- **Medium Confidence**: The survey's recommendations for future research directions are based on current trends but may not fully anticipate the rapid evolution of MLLM capabilities.
- **Low Confidence**: The long-term applicability of the four-domain taxonomy and the survey's ability to remain relevant as new benchmarks emerge.

## Next Checks

1. Map a newly published MLLM benchmark to the survey's four-domain taxonomy to test the classification system's effectiveness and identify any gaps.
2. Conduct a small-scale evaluation using the survey's task format and metric guidelines to verify their practical applicability and identify any inconsistencies.
3. Review recent MLLM research papers to assess whether emerging capabilities and evaluation needs align with the survey's identified future research directions.
