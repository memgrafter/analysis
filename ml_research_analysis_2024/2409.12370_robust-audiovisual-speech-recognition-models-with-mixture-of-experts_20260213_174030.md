# Robust Audiovisual Speech Recognition Models with Mixture-of-Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.12370
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12370
- Reference count: 0
- Outperforms prior models on three benchmarks with relative WER reductions up to 25.5%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses robust audiovisual speech recognition for unconstrained "in-the-wild" videos by leveraging visual signals to enhance accuracy. The authors propose EVA, a model that combines a robust pretrained speech recognition backbone with visual information encoded by CLIP and integrated via a mixture-of-experts (MoE) module. EVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks—How2, VisSpeech, and Ego4D—outperforming prior models, including AVFormer, despite using significantly less audiovisual training data (around 400× smaller).

## Method Summary
EVA builds upon a robust pretrained speech recognition model (OWSM v3.1) and incorporates visual information through a mixture-of-experts (MoE) module. The model processes video frames with CLIP to obtain visual tokens, which are projected into the speech space and combined with audio tokens via MoE routing. The MoE layer dynamically allocates tokens to specialized sub-networks, allowing each expert to focus on specific aspects of the multimodal input. The model is fine-tuned on the How2 dataset for 10 epochs with batch size 64, using CTC and attention losses.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on How2, VisSpeech, and Ego4D benchmarks
- Relative WER reductions of up to 25.5% on Ego4D dataset
- Outperforms AVFormer despite using approximately 400× less audiovisual training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The mixture-of-experts (MoE) module allows dynamic allocation of tokens to specialized sub-networks, improving generalization by letting each expert focus on its expertise. The MoE layer processes concatenated visual and speech tokens, routing each token to the top-K experts with highest predicted probabilities. The router is a linear layer producing a sparse E-dimensional probability vector over experts, and the output is a weighted sum of the top-K expert outputs.

### Mechanism 2
Using a robust pretrained speech recognition backbone (OWSM v3.1) ensures strong speech recognition ability before adding visual modality, providing a solid foundation for multimodal learning. EVA is built upon OWSM v3.1, which is trained on 180k hours of public labeled speech data. This backbone is kept frozen initially and only fine-tuned with audiovisual data, preserving its speech recognition capabilities while adding visual understanding through the MoE module.

### Mechanism 3
Encoding visual information with CLIP provides strong generalization across diverse video domains by leveraging CLIP's contrastive training on image-text pairs. Frames from input videos are processed by the pretrained CLIP visual encoder to obtain visual tokens, which are then projected into the speech token embedding space via a lightweight projection layer. This allows unconstrained visual features from full frames to be incorporated into the ASR model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multimodal learning and cross-modal feature fusion**: The model must effectively combine information from both audio and visual modalities to improve speech recognition accuracy, especially in noisy or unconstrained environments. *Quick check: How does the model ensure that visual information complements rather than conflicts with audio information during the fusion process?*

- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and routing mechanisms**: MoE allows the model to dynamically allocate computational resources and learn specialized representations for different aspects of the multimodal input, improving both efficiency and performance. *Quick check: What determines which experts are activated for a given token, and how does the model balance the load across experts during training?*

- **Pretraining and fine-tuning strategies in transfer learning**: The model leverages a robust pretrained ASR backbone and CLIP visual encoder, requiring careful fine-tuning to incorporate audiovisual data without losing the benefits of pretraining. *Quick check: How does the model initialize the MoE experts, and what training objectives are used to ensure the visual and speech components work together effectively?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video frames + Audio waveforms -> CLIP visual encoder -> Visual projection -> MoE module -> Concatenated tokens -> OWSM v3.1 backbone (E-Branchformer encoder + Transformer decoder) -> CTC and attention losses -> Transcribed text

- **Critical path**: Audio feature extraction → ASR backbone processing → MoE fusion with visual tokens → Decoder prediction

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using pretrained models (OWSM v3.1 and CLIP) provides strong generalization but limits architectural flexibility; MoE adds computational efficiency through sparsity but introduces complexity in routing and load balancing; concatenating visual and speech tokens simplifies fusion but may not capture all cross-modal interactions

- **Failure signatures**: High WER on audio-only test sets indicates catastrophic forgetting of speech recognition capabilities; poor performance on out-of-domain datasets suggests visual features are not generalizable; load imbalance across experts (detected via auxiliary loss) indicates routing issues

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Evaluate speech-only performance on the target dataset to establish baseline WER before adding visual components
  2. Test visual feature extraction quality by visualizing CLIP embeddings and their alignment with speech content
  3. Measure MoE expert utilization and routing probabilities to ensure proper load balancing during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the key visual features or cues that contribute most to improving speech recognition accuracy in "in-the-wild" videos? The paper mentions that visual information provides additional contextual information to improve ASR performance, but does not specify which visual features are most beneficial. Conducting an ablation study on different types of visual features (e.g., lip movements, facial expressions, scene context) to determine which ones have the most significant impact on ASR accuracy would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of EVA compare to other multimodal ASR models on datasets with diverse video domains and varying levels of noise? The paper mentions that EVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks across different domains, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other multimodal ASR models on datasets with diverse video domains and varying levels of noise. Conducting experiments to compare the performance of EVA with other multimodal ASR models on datasets with diverse video domains and varying levels of noise, such as online videos, video conferencing, TV shows, and movies, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
What is the impact of the number of experts in the mixture-of-experts module on the performance of EVA? The paper mentions that EVA uses 8 experts in the mixture-of-experts module, but does not explore the impact of varying the number of experts on the model's performance. Conducting experiments to analyze the impact of varying the number of experts in the mixture-of-experts module on the performance of EVA, and determining the optimal number of experts for different scenarios, would resolve this.

## Limitations

- Evaluation focuses on relative WER improvements without providing absolute baseline WER values
- Model's performance on truly unconstrained "in-the-wild" data is uncertain since How2 is still curated data
- Training data efficiency claim (400× smaller than AVFormer) is based on parameter counts rather than actual training data volume

## Confidence

- **State-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks**: High confidence - WER reductions are well-documented across multiple datasets with clear relative improvements
- **400× smaller training data requirement**: Medium confidence - claim is based on parameter counts rather than actual training data volume, and comparison methodology needs clarification
- **Effective visual information incorporation via MoE**: Medium confidence - mechanism is theoretically sound and ablation studies show MoE contributes to performance, but routing strategy and expert specialization are not fully characterized

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate catastrophic forgetting by testing EVA's speech-only performance on audio-only test sets before and after audiovisual fine-tuning to ensure the visual modality addition doesn't degrade core speech recognition capabilities.

2. Analyze MoE expert specialization by examining the routing probabilities and expert activation patterns across different video domains to verify that experts are learning specialized representations rather than all tokens being routed to the same experts.

3. Test visual feature alignment by conducting qualitative analysis of CLIP visual embeddings to verify they capture semantically relevant visual information aligned with speech content, using techniques like nearest-neighbor visualization or cross-modal attention analysis.
