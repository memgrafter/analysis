# A Survey on Human-AI Collaboration with Large Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04931
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04931
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Human-AI collaboration with LFMs requires careful, human-centered design across development, interaction, ethics, and application domains.

## Executive Summary
This survey reviews the evolving landscape of Human-AI Collaboration (HAI) with Large Foundation Models (LFMs), identifying four key research areas: human-guided model development, design principles for effective HAI systems, ethical and governance aspects, and applications across diverse domains. The authors emphasize that successful HAI systems are not automatic byproducts of stronger models, but rather the result of careful, human-centered design. They highlight open challenges in scaling human guidance, creating fluid but controllable interactions, ensuring accountability and governance, and achieving contextual grounding in high-stakes domains.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes literature on human-AI collaboration with large foundation models through a structured review of four key areas: human-guided model development, design principles, ethical and governance aspects, and diverse applications. The methodology involves analyzing mechanisms like active learning, preference shaping, and evaluation, while examining design principles for interaction and control, addressing ethical concerns, and exploring domain-specific implementations.

## Key Results
- Human-AI collaboration effectiveness increases when human feedback shapes model objectives rather than just evaluates outputs
- Trust and usability are built through transparent explanations and clear feedback loops
- Effective collaboration requires fluid control handoffs that adapt to context and user expertise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Human-AI collaboration effectiveness increases when human feedback is used to shape model objectives rather than just evaluate outputs.
- Mechanism: Humans provide preference-based feedback that directly tunes the model's reward or loss surface, making the AI more aligned with human values.
- Core assumption: Human preferences can be reliably captured and translated into model updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper reviews the crucial integration of LFMs with HAI, highlighting both opportunities and risks."
  - [section] "Human-Guided Objective Shaping: preference-based methods such as RLHF and DPO let human feedback reshape the model's reward or loss surface during optimisation."
  - [corpus] "Collaborative human-AI trust (CHAI-T): A process framework for active management of trust in human-AI collaboration" - weak alignment with objective shaping.
- Break condition: Human feedback becomes too noisy or inconsistent to translate into stable model updates.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Trust and usability in human-AI systems are built through transparent explanations and clear feedback loops.
- Mechanism: AI systems disclose their reasoning, confidence levels, and error bounds, allowing humans to build accurate mental models and trust.
- Core assumption: Humans can understand and act on AI explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By identifying key open challenges, this survey aims to give insight into current and future research that turns the raw power of LFMs into partnerships that are reliable, trustworthy, and beneficial to society."
  - [section] "Establishing calibrated trust begins with making model limits visible. Bansal et al. [6] show that users build more accurate mental models when an AI system discloses its own error likelihood."
  - [corpus] "Human-AI Interaction and User Satisfaction: Empirical Evidence from Online Reviews of AI Products" - limited direct evidence for explanation impact.
- Break condition: Explanations become too complex or misleading, eroding rather than building trust.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Effective human-AI collaboration requires fluid control handoffs that adapt to context and user expertise.
- Mechanism: Systems dynamically allocate control between human and AI based on situational awareness and respective strengths.
- Core assumption: The system can accurately assess when to hand off control.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The authors advocate for designing LFMs as collaborative partners that amplify human capabilities while addressing ethical concerns and maintaining human oversight."
  - [section] "Effective human-AI teaming necessitates fluent control handoffs and clearly defined delegation protocols."
  - [corpus] "Large Foundation Models for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving" - shows control handoff in driving but limited evidence for general HAI.
- Break condition: Control handoffs occur too frequently or at inappropriate times, causing confusion or errors.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Why needed here: Core mechanism for aligning large models with human preferences.
- Quick check question: What are the three stages of RLHF and how does each contribute to model alignment?

### Concept: Human-in-the-Loop Active Learning
- Why needed here: Critical for efficient data curation and model improvement with minimal human effort.
- Quick check question: How does active learning differ from traditional supervised learning in the context of human-AI collaboration?

### Concept: Multimodal Human Feedback
- Why needed here: Expands the types of human input that can guide model behavior beyond text.
- Quick check question: What are the advantages and challenges of incorporating multimodal feedback into model training?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Human Feedback Collection → Preference Model Training → Policy Optimization → Evaluation & Alignment Metrics
Interface Layer (UI/UX) → Explanation Engine → Control Handoff Manager → Privacy & Security Layer

### Critical path: Human feedback collection → model alignment → trust-building explanation → smooth control handoff

### Design tradeoffs:
- Personalization vs. Privacy: Rich data improves collaboration but increases privacy risks.
- Control vs. Autonomy: More AI autonomy increases efficiency but may reduce human skill and engagement.
- Transparency vs. Complexity: Detailed explanations build trust but can overwhelm users.

### Failure signatures:
- Inconsistent or biased human feedback leading to misaligned models.
- Overly complex explanations that users cannot understand or act upon.
- Control handoffs that are too frequent or poorly timed, disrupting workflow.

### First 3 experiments:
1. Implement a simple RLHF pipeline with synthetic human feedback to test model alignment.
2. Add an explanation layer to a basic AI system and measure user trust and mental model accuracy.
3. Design a prototype control handoff mechanism for a simulated collaborative task and test user acceptance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can human-AI collaboration frameworks be designed to ensure that human feedback is both scalable and representative, avoiding the reinforcement of societal biases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the challenge of collecting human feedback at scale while preserving diversity, noting that RLHF risks aligning models to the views of narrow groups and amplifying societal bias.
- Why unresolved: Current methods rely heavily on limited or biased annotator pools, and there is no established framework for ensuring inclusive, adversarial, and diverse human input at scale.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of scalable human feedback collection systems that demonstrably improve model fairness and inclusivity across diverse populations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective hybrid interface designs that balance the fluidity of conversational AI with the precision and control required in high-stakes decision-making environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between natural language interactions and the need for structured controls, transparency, and explicit reasoning in complex tasks.
- Why unresolved: While conversational interfaces improve approachability, they often obscure reasoning and weaken constraints, and there is no clear blueprint for integrating natural language with robust control mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing improved human-AI team performance and user trust when using hybrid interfaces that combine natural language with explicit control and reasoning visibility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can accountability and governance frameworks be structured to clearly assign responsibility in human-AI collaborative teams, especially as large foundation models become more autonomous?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the gap between the rapid deployment of large models and the slow development of governance, noting that blurred lines of responsibility make accountability nearly impossible to establish.
- Why unresolved: Existing ethical guidelines remain abstract, and there is no standardized, auditable method for tracing decision-making responsibility in collaborative human-AI systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of auditable decision trails and regulatory frameworks that demonstrably clarify responsibility and liability in real-world human-AI collaborations.

## Limitations

- The survey lacks detailed empirical validation of proposed mechanisms
- Key uncertainties include scalability of human feedback collection and generalizability of control handoff protocols
- The survey does not address potential negative consequences of over-reliance on AI

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The importance of human-centered design in HAI systems and the need for ethical governance
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of RLHF and preference shaping in aligning models with human values
- **Low Confidence**: The robustness of control handoff mechanisms and their adaptability to diverse contexts

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments to measure the impact of human feedback quality on model alignment and user trust
2. Evaluate the generalizability of HAI principles (e.g., control handoffs, explanations) across different application domains
3. Investigate the long-term effects of human-AI collaboration on user skill development and system dependency
