# Are Language Models Actually Useful for Time Series Forecasting?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.16964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16964
- Authors: Mingtian Tan; Mike A. Merrill; Vinayak Gupta; Tim Althoff; Thomas Hartvigsen
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs fail to outperform simple attention or transformer block ablations for time series forecasting, while significantly increasing computational costs

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates whether large language models provide meaningful performance gains for time series forecasting. Through comprehensive ablation studies across 13 benchmark datasets, the authors demonstrate that LLM components can be removed or replaced with simple attention layers or transformer blocks without degrading—and often improving—forecasting performance. The research reveals that current LLM-based forecasting methods incur significant computational overhead while providing minimal benefits, suggesting that simpler architectures are more appropriate for time series tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose three ablation strategies applied to three state-of-the-art LLM-based forecasting methods: removing the LLM component entirely ("w/o LLM"), replacing it with a single attention layer ("LLM2Attn"), or replacing it with a transformer block ("LLM2Trans"). These ablations are tested across 13 benchmark datasets using multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, sMAPE, MASE). The study also investigates pretraining effectiveness by comparing pretrained LLMs against randomly initialized models, and tests sequential dependency modeling by shuffling input time series data.

## Key Results
- Ablations consistently outperform or match LLM-based methods across all 13 datasets and 2 metrics (26/26 cases)
- LLM-based methods require up to three orders of magnitude more training and inference time
- Pretrained LLMs perform no better than randomly initialized models when fine-tuned on time series data
- LLMs show no unique ability to model sequential dependencies in time series data
- A simple patching-plus-attention encoder achieves performance comparable to LLM-based methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models (LLMs) do not provide meaningful performance gains for time series forecasting tasks.
- Mechanism: The authors systematically ablate LLM components (removing them entirely, replacing with attention layers, or transformer blocks) in three state-of-the-art LLM-based forecasting methods across 13 benchmark datasets. Results show that these ablations consistently achieve comparable or better performance while reducing computational costs by up to three orders of magnitude.
- Core assumption: LLM components are not essential for capturing the sequential dependencies and forecasting patterns in time series data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer does not degrade forecasting performance—in most cases, the results even improve!"
  - [section 4.1] "Overall, as shown in Table 3, across 13 datasets and two metrics, ablations out perform Time-LLM methods in 26/26 cases, CALF in 22/26 cases, and OneFitsAll in 19/26 cases."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on integrating LLMs with time series but don't challenge the core claim that LLMs are unnecessary.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pretraining on language data does not meaningfully improve LLM performance for time series forecasting.
- Mechanism: The authors test whether LLM pretraining aids forecasting by re-initializing LLM weights to random values before training on time series data. Results show no significant difference in forecasting performance between pretrained and randomly initialized LLMs.
- Core assumption: Knowledge gained from language pretraining does not transfer effectively to time series forecasting tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "despite their significant computational cost, pretrained LLMs do no better than models trained from scratch"
  - [section 4.3] "Our evaluation in this section indicates that pretraining with language datasets is unnecessary for time series forecasting... Across 8 datasets using MAE and MSE metrics, the 'Pretraining + Finetune' method performed the best 3 times, while 'Random Initialization + Finetune' achieved this 8 times."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers assume LLM pretraining is beneficial but don't empirically test this assumption.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs do not effectively model sequential dependencies in time series data.
- Mechanism: The authors test whether LLMs capture sequential dependencies by shuffling input time series (entire sequence, first half, or swapping halves) and measuring forecasting performance. Results show no significant performance degradation from shuffling, suggesting LLMs do not uniquely capture sequential dependencies.
- Core assumption: Effective time series forecasting models should show performance degradation when sequential dependencies are disrupted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "do not represent the sequential dependencies in time series"
  - [section 4.4] "We applied three types of shuffling to the time series... LLM-based methods were no more vulnerable to input shuffling than their ablations. This implies that LLMs do not have unique capabilities for representing sequential dependencies in time series."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers assume LLMs can capture sequential dependencies but don't empirically test this assumption.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Ablation studies and controlled experimentation
  - Why needed here: The paper's core methodology relies on systematically removing or replacing components (LLMs) to isolate their contribution to performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of comparing LLM-based methods against their ablations in controlled experiments?

- Concept: Computational complexity analysis
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that LLM-based methods incur significant computational costs while providing minimal performance benefits.
  - Quick check question: How do the authors quantify and compare the computational costs between LLM-based methods and their ablations?

- Concept: Transfer learning and pretraining effectiveness
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates whether pretraining on language data provides advantages for time series forecasting tasks.
  - Quick check question: What experimental approach do the authors use to test whether language pretraining benefits time series forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input encoding -> LLM component or ablation -> Alignment (if LLM-based) -> Output projection -> Forecast values

- Critical path:
  1. Encode input time series using chosen encoding method
  2. Pass encoded representation through LLM or ablation component
  3. Apply alignment if using LLM-based approach
  4. Project output to forecast values
  5. Compute loss and backpropagate

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM-based approaches offer potential for multimodal reasoning but incur significant computational costs
  - Ablation approaches (attention, transformer blocks) provide similar performance with much lower computational overhead
  - Pretrained LLMs don't offer clear advantages over randomly initialized models for time series forecasting

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on shuffled input time series (suggests model relies on sequential dependencies)
  - Significant performance degradation when removing LLM components (suggests LLMs provide unique value)
  - High computational costs without corresponding performance gains (suggests inefficiency)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline results for one LLM-based method on a standard dataset
  2. Implement and test the "w/o LLM" ablation on the same dataset and compare performance
  3. Implement and test the "LLM2Attn" ablation and compare performance and computational costs against both baseline and "w/o LLM" approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific mechanisms or architectural modifications could enable LLMs to effectively model sequential dependencies in time series data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that LLMs fail to effectively represent sequential dependencies in time series, as evidenced by their similar performance to ablations when input data is shuffled.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore potential architectural changes or training strategies that might help LLMs capture time series patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing various positional encoding schemes, modified attention mechanisms, or hybrid architectures designed specifically for temporal data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Under what specific conditions or data characteristics might LLMs provide performance advantages over simpler models for time series forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that LLMs might be more useful in multimodal applications requiring textual reasoning, suggesting they could have advantages in certain contexts.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on traditional time series forecasting tasks and does not explore edge cases or specialized domains where LLMs might excel.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of LLM performance across diverse time series datasets with varying characteristics (e.g., seasonality, noise levels, domain-specific features).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the computational costs of LLMs compare to simpler models when scaling to larger, more complex time series datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that LLMs significantly increase computational costs without meaningful performance gains on the tested datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper's analysis is limited to relatively small to medium-sized datasets, and the scaling behavior for larger datasets remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking studies comparing LLM and ablation model performance and computational requirements on datasets with millions of time steps and hundreds of features.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on relatively short time series horizons (typically 24-48 steps ahead), potentially missing LLM advantages for longer-range forecasting
- Evaluation is limited to univariate and low-dimensional multivariate time series, not exploring high-dimensional or multimodal scenarios
- The study primarily uses English-language benchmarks, leaving questions about performance with non-English or culturally-specific temporal patterns

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The ablation experiments showing that simple transformer blocks or attention layers match or exceed LLM performance across 13 datasets. The computational cost analysis comparing training and inference times is straightforward and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The conclusions about pretraining ineffectiveness, as the study uses only two pretrained LLM variants (GPT-2 and LLaMA) and limited pretraining durations. Results might vary with different LLM architectures or pretraining strategies.
- **Medium confidence**: The sequential dependency findings, as the shuffling experiments test only three specific disruption patterns and may not exhaustively explore all ways sequential information could be valuable.

## Next Checks
1. **Extended Horizon Testing**: Replicate the ablation experiments on datasets requiring long-term forecasts (e.g., 365+ steps ahead) to determine if LLM advantages emerge only at longer timescales where pattern recognition and context retention become more critical.

2. **High-Dimensional Multimodal Extension**: Apply the ablation framework to high-dimensional multivariate time series (e.g., 100+ variables) and multimodal datasets combining time series with text or categorical metadata to test whether LLMs provide value when handling complex feature interactions.

3. **Cross-Lingual and Domain Transfer**: Test the same ablation methodology on non-English time series datasets and domain-specific data (e.g., medical, financial, or industrial time series) to evaluate whether language pretraining provides benefits in specific cultural or professional contexts.
