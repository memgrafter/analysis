# Pronunciation Assessment with Multi-modal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09209
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09209

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multi-modal pronunciation assessment system using large language models (LLMs) for scoring non-native English speakers' fluency and accuracy. The core idea is to combine a speech encoder (data2vec2), a modality adapter (m-adapter), and an LLM-based scoring module. The system is trained in two stages: first for speech recognition, then fine-tuned for pronunciation assessment. The proposed align-free approach achieves competitive performance compared to traditional align-based and align-free systems on the Speechocean762 dataset, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.777 for fluency and 0.713 for accuracy. The system also achieves state-of-the-art results in ASR tasks. Ablation studies show that both ASR training and prompt text contribute to the model's effectiveness, particularly for accuracy scoring.

## Method Summary
The proposed multi-modal pronunciation assessment system consists of three main components: a speech encoder (data2vec2), a modality adapter (m-adapter), and an LLM-based scoring module (Qwen-7B). The system uses a two-stage training approach where it first trains on ASR tasks using the Librispeech dataset, then fine-tunes on pronunciation assessment data from the Speechocean762 dataset. The m-adapter aligns speech features to the LLM's text embedding space through pooling convolutions and multi-head self-attention. Structured prompt text and task-specific prefixes guide the LLM to generate appropriate pronunciation scores. The model takes speech audio as input and outputs fluency and accuracy scores for non-native English speakers.

## Key Results
- Achieves Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.777 for fluency and 0.713 for accuracy on Speechocean762 dataset
- Outperforms traditional align-based systems and other align-free approaches in pronunciation assessment
- Achieves state-of-the-art results in ASR tasks with the proposed architecture
- Ablation studies show both ASR pretraining and prompt text are essential for optimal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The m-adapter aligns speech features to the latent space of LLM text embeddings.
- Mechanism: The m-adapter uses pooling convolutions and multi-head self-attention to transform the high-dimensional speech sequence into a representation that matches the dimensionality and semantic space of LLM embeddings.
- Core assumption: Speech and text modalities can be aligned in a shared latent space for joint processing by the LLM.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The adapter layer then transforms these features to align with the text embedding in latent space."
  - [section] "It consists of two pooling convolutions and a multi-head self-attention (MSA) layer."
- Break condition: If speech features cannot be meaningfully projected into the LLM's text embedding space, the concatenated input becomes semantically incoherent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage training improves pronunciation assessment performance.
- Mechanism: First, training on ASR tasks establishes strong cross-modal alignment between speech and text. Second, fine-tuning on pronunciation assessment data adapts the model to scoring tasks while retaining ASR-derived robustness.
- Core assumption: ASR training improves the model's ability to understand speech content, which benefits accuracy scoring.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The first stage is to train the model in the speech recognition task, and then the model will be fine-tuned based on the task-specific scoring data in the second stage."
  - [table 4] "ASR training + Prompt text 0.777 0.713"
- Break condition: If ASR pretraining introduces noise or biases that interfere with scoring objectives, performance may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt text and task-specific prefixes guide the LLM's scoring behavior.
- Mechanism: Structured prompt text ("<Pronunciation Assessment> the prompt text is ...") combined with a task-specific prefix provides explicit context for the LLM to interpret input features and generate appropriate score outputs.
- Core assumption: LLMs can follow structured instructions to perform specialized tasks when given appropriate context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The assessment task-specific prefix and prompt text are embedded and concatenated with the features generated by the modality adapter layer, enabling the LLMs to predict accuracy and fluency scores."
  - [section] "For the ground truth, we structured it as 'accuracy : 9 fluency : 7'"
- Break condition: If prompts are ambiguous or the LLM fails to parse the task format, output scores may be unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal feature alignment
  - Why needed here: The system needs to process speech and text in a unified framework, requiring speech features to be mapped to the LLM's text embedding space.
  - Quick check question: How does the m-adapter ensure that speech features are compatible with text embeddings?

- Concept: Multi-task pretraining
  - Why needed here: ASR pretraining establishes strong speech-text alignment before fine-tuning for scoring, improving overall model performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of training on ASR before pronunciation assessment?

- Concept: Prompt engineering for LLMs
  - Why needed here: Structured prompts guide the LLM to perform scoring tasks rather than general language understanding.
  - Quick check question: How does the task-specific prefix affect the LLM's output format?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data2vec2 speech encoder -> m-adapter -> LLM-based scorer (with prompt text)
- Critical path: Raw audio -> speech features -> modality alignment -> LLM scoring
- Design tradeoffs: Using ASR pretraining improves performance but increases training time and complexity
- Failure signatures: Low Pearson correlation indicates poor alignment or prompt issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ASR performance with different speech encoders (Data2vec2, Whisper, Hubert)
  2. Evaluate scoring with and without ASR pretraining
  3. Compare results using different prompt text structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- The model's performance on fluency scoring remains notably lower than accuracy scoring, suggesting incomplete modeling of temporal coherence aspects.
- Reliance on prompt-based scoring may be less robust than more explicit regression approaches.
- ASR pretraining stage increases computational requirements significantly.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Experimental results on Speechocean762 dataset showing competitive performance against traditional align-based systems; the ASR pretraining approach demonstrating clear benefits for pronunciation assessment; the effectiveness of the m-adapter in bridging speech and text modalities.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that the proposed method is truly "align-free" given that ASR pretraining implicitly involves alignment learning; the generalizability of results beyond the Chinese English learners in the dataset.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that this is the first work to apply align-free methods to pronunciation assessment; the scalability of the approach to other languages or assessment types.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate model performance when prompt text contains errors or is missing, to verify the claimed robustness of the align-free approach under realistic conditions.

2. **Cross-Lingual Generalization**: Test the model on pronunciation assessment datasets from different language backgrounds (e.g., Romance languages) to assess true modality alignment capabilities rather than language-specific patterns.

3. **Comparative Prompt Analysis**: Systematically vary prompt text structures and assess impact on scoring accuracy to better understand the contribution of prompt engineering versus model architecture.
