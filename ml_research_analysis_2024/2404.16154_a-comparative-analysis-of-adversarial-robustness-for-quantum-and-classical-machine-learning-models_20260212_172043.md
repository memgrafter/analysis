# A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.16154
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16154
- Authors: Maximilian Wendlinger; Kilian Tscharke; Pascal Debus
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of quantum and classical machine learning models, aiming to understand the similarities and differences between them.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates adversarial robustness in quantum and classical machine learning models through a comparative analysis. The authors construct a synthetic 4-class image classification dataset and train various models including quantum circuits with re-upload and amplitude encoding, a classical convolutional network, and a Fourier network that approximates quantum circuits. They evaluate models using adversarial attacks, transfer attacks, and Lipschitz bounds. Key findings include that regularization improves quantum model robustness, attacks transfer across quantum-classical boundaries in both directions, and the Fourier network serves as a "middle ground" between classical and quantum models with comparable Lipschitz bounds.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a synthetic 4-class image dataset (16×16 pixels) with symbols '-', '+', '⊢', '⊣' and train four model architectures: quantum circuits with re-upload encoding (32 layers, 8 qubits, 1536 parameters) and amplitude encoding (32 layers, 8 qubits, 768 parameters), a classical ConvNet (1 conv layer, 1 linear layer, 1024 parameters), and a Fourier network (1 hidden layer with sine/cosine activations, 32 latent neurons). Models are trained using Adam optimizer (lr=0.001) for 20 epochs. Adversarial robustness is evaluated using PGD attacks with ℓ∞ norm constraints (ε ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2}), transfer attack experiments between all model pairs, and Lipschitz bounds calculated using LipSDP framework for theoretical robustness measures.

## Key Results
- Regularization significantly improves the robustness of quantum models and reduces their Lipschitz bounds
- Adversarial attacks successfully transfer across the quantum-classical boundary in both directions
- The Fourier network serves as a "middle ground" between classical and quantum models in terms of architecture and robustness properties
- Lipschitz bounds correlate with model robustness, with regularized quantum models having bounds comparable to classical models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Regularization of quantum models reduces Lipschitz bounds and improves robustness.
- Mechanism: Lipschitz regularization constrains encoding weights to remain small, preventing over-reliance on single input features. This reduces the model's sensitivity to small perturbations.
- Core assumption: The Lipschitz bound is a reliable proxy for adversarial robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "regularization helps quantum networks to be more robust, which has direct impact on Lipschitz bounds and transfer attacks"
  - [section] "Lipschitz bounds correlate with the models' robustness, with regularized quantum models having bounds comparable to classical models"
  - [corpus] "Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers" - related work on Lipschitz bounds for quantum classifiers
- Break condition: If the Lipschitz bound fails to correlate with actual adversarial robustness, the regularization mechanism loses predictive power.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Transfer attacks work across quantum-classical boundaries.
- Mechanism: Despite architectural differences, quantum and classical models learn similar decision boundaries, allowing adversarial perturbations to transfer between them.
- Core assumption: The underlying feature representations learned by quantum and classical models are sufficiently aligned.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "attacks transfer across the quantum-classical boundary in both directions"
  - [section] "adversarial attacks successfully transfer across this boundary in both directions"
  - [corpus] "Experimental robustness benchmarking of quantum neural networks" - related work on transfer attacks in quantum ML
- Break condition: If models learn fundamentally different feature representations, transfer attacks would fail across the quantum-classical boundary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fourier networks act as a "middle ground" between quantum and classical models.
- Mechanism: Fourier networks approximate the function class of quantum circuits while remaining classically computable, bridging the architectural gap.
- Core assumption: The Fourier series approximation captures essential characteristics of quantum circuit behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we introduce a classical approximation of QML circuits... and evaluate this model, denoted Fourier network, in comparison to other architectures. Our findings show that this Fourier network can be seen as a 'middle ground' on the quantum-classical boundary."
  - [section] "this Fourier network can be seen as a 'middle ground' on the quantum-classical boundary"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for the "middle ground" claim
- Break condition: If the Fourier network approximation fails to capture key quantum circuit properties, it cannot serve as a meaningful bridge.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQC)
  - Why needed here: PQCs form the basis of quantum machine learning models being compared to classical models
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes amplitude encoding from re-upload encoding in PQCs?

- Concept: Adversarial Machine Learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding adversarial attacks and robustness is central to the paper's investigation
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between white-box and black-box attacks in adversarial ML?

- Concept: Lipschitz Continuity
  - Why needed here: Lipschitz bounds are used as a theoretical measure of model robustness
  - Quick check question: How does the Lipschitz constant relate to a function's sensitivity to input perturbations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Synthetic Dataset → Model Training → PGD Attack Generation → Transfer Attack Evaluation → Lipschitz Bound Calculation → Analysis
- Critical path: Dataset generation → Model training (20 epochs) → Attack generation (PGD) → Transfer attack evaluation → Lipschitz bound calculation → Robustness analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. expressiveness (ConvNet vs. PQC), Classical vs. quantum advantage, Regularization vs. model capacity
- Failure signatures: High Lipschitz bounds, successful transfer attacks, noisy perturbation patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train all models on synthetic dataset and verify near-perfect accuracy
  2. Generate PGD attacks for each model and measure accuracy under attack
  3. Conduct transfer attacks between all pairs of models and record results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do Lipschitz bounds correlate with the transferability of adversarial attacks across quantum-classical boundaries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that Lipschitz bounds correlate with attack transferability, with regularized quantum models having bounds comparable to classical models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates a correlation, it does not establish a precise mathematical relationship or determine if Lipschitz bounds can be used as a reliable predictor of transferability across different model architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing Lipschitz bounds and transfer attack success rates across a wide range of classical and quantum model architectures, establishing a quantitative relationship between the two.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can regularization techniques improve the interpretability of adversarial perturbation patterns in quantum models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that regularization helps quantum models to be more robust and that attack perturbation patterns become less noisy with regularization.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that regularization affects perturbation patterns, it does not investigate whether these patterns become more interpretable or align better with human perception of meaningful features.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of perturbation patterns with and without regularization, comparing them to human-annotated feature importance maps and evaluating their interpretability using established metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of data encoding strategy (e.g., amplitude vs. re-upload) impact the adversarial robustness and transferability of quantum models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares amplitude and re-upload encoding models, showing that amplitude encoding exhibits different behavior in terms of robustness and transferability.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a preliminary comparison, but a more thorough investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for these differences and to determine if one encoding strategy is inherently more robust than the other.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing the adversarial robustness and transferability of quantum models with different encoding strategies, analyzing the impact on Lipschitz bounds, perturbation patterns, and transfer attack success rates.

## Limitations
- The use of a synthetic dataset rather than real-world data may limit generalizability of findings to practical scenarios
- Computational constraints of simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware may have restricted the depth and width of quantum models tested
- The paper does not establish a precise mathematical relationship between Lipschitz bounds and transferability across different model architectures

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Claims about regularization improving quantum model robustness and reducing Lipschitz bounds
- Medium Confidence: Transferability of attacks across quantum-classical boundaries
- Medium Confidence: The "middle ground" characterization of Fourier networks

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Repeat the robustness analysis on a standard dataset like MNIST or Fashion-MNIST to verify that findings about regularization benefits and attack transferability generalize beyond synthetic data.

2. **Transferability mechanism analysis**: Conduct feature visualization experiments (e.g., t-SNE plots) to empirically demonstrate how quantum and classical models align their decision boundaries, providing concrete evidence for why attacks transfer across boundaries.

3. **Extended regularization study**: Systematically explore a wider range of regularization strengths (λ values) and regularization types (beyond just Lipschitz) to determine optimal robustness-accuracy tradeoffs and establish more robust theoretical bounds.
