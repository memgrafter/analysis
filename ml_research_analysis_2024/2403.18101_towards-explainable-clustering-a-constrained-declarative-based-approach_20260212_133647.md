# Towards Explainable Clustering: A Constrained Declarative based Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18101
- Reference count: 8
- ECS method for explainable clustering that builds clusters and explanations simultaneously

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ECS (Explainable Clustering System), a novel method that addresses the challenge of producing high-quality clustering while generating interpretable explanations. ECS employs an ensemble approach to generate candidate clusters and uses Constraint Programming to select clusters and patterns that satisfy coverage and discrimination constraints. The method allows integration of various types of constraints including Must-Link, Cannot-Link, and size constraints, making it adaptable to domain knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that ECS produces interpretable clusters with good explanations while outperforming baseline methods in terms of discrimination.

## Method Summary
ECS uses a two-phase approach to explainable clustering. First, it generates multiple clustering solutions through an ensemble method to create candidate clusters. Second, it employs Constraint Programming to select an optimal subset of clusters and associated patterns that satisfy specified coverage and discrimination constraints. The method integrates domain knowledge through Must-Link (items that must be in the same cluster), Cannot-Link (items that must be in different clusters), and size constraints. The framework also introduces novel evaluation metrics specifically designed for clustering explanations, including Pattern Coverage Rate, Explanation Coverage, and Inverse Pattern Contrastivity.

## Key Results
- ECS simultaneously produces clusters and explanations with high interpretability
- Outperforms baseline methods in discrimination metrics on real-world datasets
- Successfully incorporates various constraint types (Must-Link, Cannot-Link, size constraints)
- Novel evaluation metrics provide meaningful assessment of clustering explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ECS works by combining the diversity of ensemble clustering with the precision of constraint programming. The ensemble phase generates multiple candidate clusterings, capturing different perspectives on the data structure. The constraint programming phase then selects from these candidates to optimize for both coverage (ensuring data points are well-represented) and discrimination (ensuring clusters are distinct and meaningful). By incorporating domain knowledge through constraints, ECS can guide the clustering process toward more interpretable and relevant solutions.

## Foundational Learning

### Constraint Programming
- Why needed: Provides a flexible framework for expressing and solving complex combinatorial problems with multiple constraints
- Quick check: Can encode Must-Link, Cannot-Link, and size constraints as integer programming problems

### Ensemble Clustering
- Why needed: Generates diverse candidate solutions that capture different data structures
- Quick check: Multiple clustering algorithms run with different parameters produce varied partitionings

### Pattern Mining in Clustering
- Why needed: Extracts meaningful patterns that explain cluster membership and enhance interpretability
- Quick check: Association rules or frequent itemsets can be used to describe cluster characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data -> Ensemble Clustering -> Candidate Clusters -> Constraint Programming -> Selected Clusters + Explanations

### Critical Path
The constraint programming solver is the critical component that determines the final cluster selection and explanations. Its performance directly impacts solution quality and computational efficiency.

### Design Tradeoffs
- Ensemble size vs. computational cost: Larger ensembles provide more candidates but increase processing time
- Constraint strictness vs. solution feasibility: Tighter constraints may make finding solutions difficult
- Coverage vs. discrimination: Balancing comprehensive data representation with cluster distinctiveness

### Failure Signatures
- Infeasible solutions when constraints conflict
- Poor discrimination when constraints don't adequately guide selection
- Computational intractability on large datasets due to constraint programming complexity

### First Experiments
1. Test with synthetic data where ground truth is known to evaluate explanation accuracy
2. Compare single constraint types (only Must-Link, only Cannot-Link) to assess individual impact
3. Vary constraint strictness levels to find optimal balance between feasibility and quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Constraint expressiveness limited to Must-Link, Cannot-Link, and size-based rules
- Scalability concerns with current datasets being relatively small (largest at 12,650 instances)
- Novel evaluation metrics lack validation against human judgment of explanation quality

## Confidence

**Major claims and confidence levels:**
- ECS can simultaneously produce clusters and explanations: High confidence
- The method effectively incorporates domain knowledge through constraints: Medium confidence (limited validation on constraint types)
- ECS outperforms baselines in discrimination: High confidence (based on experimental results)
- The novel evaluation metrics meaningfully capture explanation quality: Low confidence (no human validation)

## Next Checks

1. Test ECS on significantly larger datasets (100K+ instances) to evaluate computational scalability and solution quality degradation
2. Conduct human evaluation studies where domain experts rate the interpretability and usefulness of ECS-generated explanations versus baseline methods
3. Experiment with constraint types beyond Must-Link and Cannot-Link (e.g., soft constraints, hierarchical constraints) to assess the framework's flexibility for different domain knowledge representations
