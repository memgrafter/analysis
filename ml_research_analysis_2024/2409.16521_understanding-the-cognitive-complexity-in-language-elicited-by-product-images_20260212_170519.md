# Understanding the Cognitive Complexity in Language Elicited by Product Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16521
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16521
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Models show correlations of 0.16-0.31 with human ratings for cognitive complexity of text elicited by product images

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to measuring and validating the cognitive complexity of language elicited by product images. The authors introduce a large dataset containing over 4,000 product images across 14 categories, along with 45,609 human-generated text labels and complexity ratings. They propose a set of natural language models that combine multiple relevant constructs - visibility, semantics, uniqueness, and concreteness - to approximate cognitive complexity. The models show promising results, with correlations ranging from 0.16 to 0.31 with human ratings across different product categories. The approach is minimally supervised and scalable, even for use cases with limited human assessment of complexity.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a dataset of 4,000+ product images across 14 categories, collecting 45,609 human-generated text labels and complexity ratings. They created four natural language models to approximate cognitive complexity: visibility (image-text joint representation), semantics (semantic distance between text and image), uniqueness (rarity of words in categories), and concreteness (perceptual vs abstract nature). The models combine these constructs using weights determined by their individual correlations with human judgments. The approach is validated by comparing model predictions with human-rated complexity across different product categories.

## Key Results
- Human-rated cognitive complexity correlates with model predictions at 0.16-0.31 across product categories
- Visibility and semantics models outperform text-only models, suggesting visual information adds value
- Partial correlations between constructs are low, indicating complementary information
- Combination models show improved performance over individual constructs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cognitive complexity can be approximated by combining multiple complementary constructs (visibility, semantics, uniqueness, concreteness)
- Mechanism: Each construct captures a different dimension of complexity - visibility measures visual salience, semantics measures semantic distance, uniqueness measures word rarity, and concreteness measures perceptual vs abstract nature
- Core assumption: Cognitive complexity is multi-dimensional and can be decomposed into measurable sub-constructs that are complementary rather than redundant
- Evidence anchors: Human-rated complexity can be approximated using natural language models; cognitive complexity includes multiple sub-constructs; low correlations between constructs support complementarity
- Break condition: If constructs are highly correlated with each other, combining them won't improve prediction

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Image-text joint representations provide meaningful information beyond text alone
- Mechanism: Models using both image and text (visibility and semantics) perform better than text-only models (uniqueness and concreteness)
- Core assumption: Visual properties of images influence how people generate and rate complexity of language descriptions
- Evidence anchors: Visibility and semantics constructs are top performers; image stimulus provides meaningful information for computing complexity
- Break condition: If text descriptions alone were sufficient, joint models wouldn't outperform text-only models

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human-rated complexity correlates with multiple independent measures of language and visual properties
- Mechanism: Statistically significant correlations (0.16-0.31) between human complexity ratings and each model's predictions across categories
- Core assumption: Human ratings provide reasonable proxy for ground truth cognitive complexity
- Evidence anchors: Models show promising results with correlations ranging from 0.16 to 0.31; models of visibility, semantics, uniqueness, and concreteness are correlated with human judgments
- Break condition: If human ratings were arbitrary or inconsistent, correlations would be near zero

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Spearman correlation as a measure of monotonic relationship
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Spearman correlation to compare model predictions with human ratings, appropriate when relationship may not be linear
  - Quick check question: Why might Spearman correlation be preferred over Pearson correlation for comparing model predictions with human ratings?

- **Concept**: Partial correlation and controlling for confounding variables
  - Why needed here: The paper computes partial correlations between constructs to determine if they provide complementary information, controlling for influence of other constructs
  - Quick check question: What would it mean if the partial correlation between two constructs was near zero while their simple correlation was high?

- **Concept**: Weighted combination of predictive models
  - Why needed here: The final complexity score combines multiple constructs using weights based on their individual performance
  - Quick check question: How are the weights for combining the different complexity constructs determined in this paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data collection → Text label elicitation → Human complexity rating → Model construction (4 constructs) → Model combination → Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Data collection and human rating phase is critical as it provides ground truth for model validation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Human ratings provide ground truth but are expensive; text-only models are cheaper but less accurate; image-text models improve accuracy but require more complex models
- **Failure signatures**: Low correlations with human ratings, high correlations between constructs (indicating redundancy), inconsistent performance across product categories
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run each individual construct model on a small subset of data and compare their correlations with human ratings
  2. Compute partial correlations between all pairs of constructs to verify they are complementary
  3. Combine top-performing constructs using weighted sum and evaluate performance improvement over individual models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the cognitive complexity of language elicited by product images differ between humans and large language models (LLMs)?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses using cognitive complexity to distinguish between human and LLM-generated language, but lacks empirical evidence comparing human-generated and LLM-generated responses
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes potential for using cognitive complexity to distinguish human from LLM responses but doesn't provide direct comparison
- What evidence would resolve it: Study where both humans and LLMs generate text labels for product images, followed by measuring and comparing cognitive complexity of generated labels

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed approach for measuring cognitive complexity generalize to domains outside of consumer products?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions potential for broader use but doesn't explore applicability to other domains
- Why unresolved: Experiments focus on product images; unclear whether approach works for other domains with different visual stimuli
- What evidence would resolve it: Apply approach to measure cognitive complexity in responses to visual stimuli from different domains (art, nature, scientific diagrams)

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal weights for combining the different constructs to improve prediction power?
- Basis in paper: The paper presents correlations between combinations of constructs but doesn't explore optimal weights
- Why unresolved: While combinations are provided, optimal weights for maximizing prediction power are not determined
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying weights assigned to each construct and evaluating impact on correlation with human judgments

## Limitations
- Correlations with human ratings (0.16-0.31) represent relatively weak relationships that may not generalize well
- Human ratings introduce subjectivity and potential cultural/linguistic biases
- Dataset covers only 14 product categories, limiting generalizability
- Models trained and validated on same dataset, creating potential overfitting risks

## Confidence
- **Medium confidence**: Core claim that cognitive complexity can be approximated by combining visibility, semantics, uniqueness, and concreteness constructs
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that image-text joint representations provide meaningful information beyond text alone
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that human-rated complexity correlates with multiple independent measures

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-population validation**: Test model predictions against human complexity ratings from different demographic groups to assess generalizability
2. **Temporal stability assessment**: Re-rate 100 images after 2-4 weeks to measure test-retest reliability of human ratings
3. **Independent dataset validation**: Apply trained models to completely independent dataset of product images with newly collected human ratings to check for overfitting
