# SCGNet-Stacked Convolution with Gated Recurrent Unit Network for Cyber Network Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Type Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21873
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21873
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 99.76% accuracy for binary attack detection and 98.92% accuracy for multiclass attack type classification on NSL-KDD dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SCGNet, a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines 1D convolutional layers with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers for network intrusion detection and attack type classification. The model employs a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline including one-hot encoding, normalization, and SMOTE for handling categorical features, scaling numerical features, and addressing class imbalance. Using Random Search and Hyperband for hyperparameter optimization, SCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NSL-KDD dataset with 99.76% accuracy for binary attack detection and 98.92% accuracy for multiclass classification, outperforming conventional machine learning models.

## Method Summary
SCGNet integrates 1D convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction from network traffic sequences with GRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. The architecture uses Random Search for architecture definition and Hyperband for hyperparameter optimization, trained over 500 epochs with Adam optimizer and exponential learning rate decay. The preprocessing pipeline includes one-hot encoding for categorical variables, normalization for numerical features, and SMOTE for handling class imbalance in the NSL-KDD dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.76% accuracy for binary network attack detection on NSL-KDD
- Achieved 98.92% accuracy for multiclass attack type classification on NSL-KDD
- Outperformed conventional machine learning models in comparative analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Stacked 1D convolutional layers extract local spatial patterns in network traffic sequences, while GRUs capture long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate attack detection.
- Mechanism: Convolutional layers perform local feature extraction by learning spatial hierarchies of traffic features. The resulting feature maps are then processed by GRUs, which model sequential dependencies across the traffic flow, capturing temporal attack patterns.
- Core assumption: Network traffic data can be represented as 1D sequences where both spatial patterns (e.g., packet size distributions) and temporal dependencies (e.g., attack phases) are informative.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SCGNet combines 1D convolution and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers to detect and classify network attacks."
  - [section] "We have developed a Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture by stacking 1D Convolution and GRU."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about this specific architecture.
- Break condition: If traffic patterns are highly irregular or if the temporal component is less important than spatial features alone.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hyperparameter optimization using Random Search and Hyperband ensures optimal model depth, node counts, and dropout rates, leading to high accuracy.
- Mechanism: Random Search explores a wide range of architectural configurations by randomly sampling hyperparameters. Hyperband then efficiently allocates resources to promising configurations, terminating poor performers early, thus finding optimal settings faster than exhaustive search.
- Core assumption: The search space contains configurations that significantly improve performance over default or manually chosen settings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method employs a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline and hyperparameter optimization using Random Search and Hyperband."
  - [section] "We have defined the network using Random Search [13] for architecture definition Hyperband [8] for hyperparameter search."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence directly supports this specific optimization approach.
- Break condition: If the hyperparameter space is too large or if the performance gain is marginal compared to the computational cost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data preprocessing including one-hot encoding, normalization, and SMOTE effectively handles categorical features, scales numerical features, and addresses class imbalance, respectively.
- Mechanism: One-hot encoding transforms categorical features into binary vectors, allowing ML models to process them. Normalization scales numerical features to a standard range, improving convergence. SMOTE generates synthetic minority class samples to balance the dataset, reducing bias toward majority classes.
- Core assumption: The dataset contains categorical and numerical features requiring preprocessing, and class imbalance exists that needs addressing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "One-hot encoding... normalization... SMOTE... for our dataset."
  - [section] "Considering that SMOTE is a technique for oversampling that provides artificial samples just for the minority class."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about this specific preprocessing pipeline.
- Break condition: If the dataset is already balanced, or if the categorical features are not informative, or if SMOTE introduces noise rather than helpful synthetic samples.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: One-hot encoding
  - Why needed here: Network traffic datasets like NSL-KDD contain categorical variables (e.g., protocol types, service types) that need to be converted into a numerical format for the neural network.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between one-hot encoding and label encoding for categorical variables?

- Concept: Normalization (Standardization/Z-score)
  - Why needed here: Numerical features in network traffic data (e.g., duration, packet sizes) have varying scales, and normalization ensures they contribute equally to the model's learning process.
  - Quick check question: Why is standardization preferred over min-max scaling when the data follows a Gaussian distribution?

- Concept: Class imbalance and SMOTE
  - Why needed here: The NSL-KDD dataset has imbalanced attack classes, and SMOTE generates synthetic samples for minority classes to improve model performance on underrepresented attacks.
  - Quick check question: How does SMOTE generate synthetic samples for the minority class?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer → Conv1D (32 kernels, size 2) → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Conv1D (64 kernels, size 2) → BatchNorm → MaxPool → GRU (100 nodes) → BatchNorm → Dropout → GRU (100 nodes) → BatchNorm → Dropout → Flatten → Dense (64 nodes) → Dropout → Output (1 sigmoid for binary, 5 softmax for multiclass)
- Critical path: The data flows from input through convolutional blocks for feature extraction, then through GRU blocks for temporal modeling, and finally through dense layers for classification.
- Design tradeoffs: Deeper convolutional blocks might capture more complex patterns but increase computational cost. More GRU nodes could model longer dependencies but risk overfitting. Dropout rates balance regularization and information retention.
- Failure signatures: Overfitting (high training accuracy, low validation accuracy), underfitting (low accuracy on both), vanishing gradients (poor training progress), class imbalance issues (poor performance on minority classes).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with only convolutional layers (no GRUs) to assess the contribution of temporal modeling.
  2. Train with only GRUs (no convolutions) to assess the contribution of spatial feature extraction.
  3. Train with varying numbers of convolutional and GRU blocks (e.g., 1 Conv + 1 GRU, 2 Conv + 2 GRU, 3 Conv + 3 GRU) to find the optimal depth.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the SCGNet architecture perform on other network intrusion detection datasets beyond NSL-KDD, such as UNSW-NB15 or CSE-CIC-IDS2018?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention wanting to experiment with their model on other state-of-the-art datasets like UNSW-NB15 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 in the future work section.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates SCGNet on the NSL-KDD dataset. Performance on other datasets with different characteristics and attack types remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running SCGNet on UNSW-NB15 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets and comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to existing state-of-the-art models on those datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of SCGNet change when using different hyperparameter optimization techniques beyond Random Search and Hyperband?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use Random Search for architecture definition and Hyperband for hyperparameter search, but mention this as a potential area for improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore alternative hyperparameter optimization methods that might yield better results or faster convergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing SCGNet performance using other optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, or Gradient-based methods on the same datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of feature explainability techniques on understanding the SCGNet model's decision-making process in intrusion detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention feature explainability as an important aspect they would like to address for industrial use cases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not implement or discuss any feature importance or model interpretability methods for the SCGNet architecture.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying techniques like SHAP values, LIME, or integrated gradients to SCGNet predictions and analyzing which features contribute most to attack detection decisions.

## Limitations

- Performance evaluation limited to a single dataset (NSL-KDD) without cross-validation or testing on other network intrusion datasets
- Hyperparameter optimization methodology lacks implementation details, making exact reproduction challenging
- Computational cost of Random Search + Hyperband approach not discussed or compared to simpler optimization methods

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall framework combining Conv1D and GRU layers for network intrusion detection is well-established in the literature, and the preprocessing steps (one-hot encoding, normalization) are standard practices.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific performance metrics (99.76% accuracy for binary, 98.92% for multiclass) are impressive but based on a single dataset, limiting generalizability. The hyperparameter optimization approach is plausible but lacks implementation details.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim of achieving "state-of-the-art" results is not robustly supported without comparisons to recent deep learning approaches on the same dataset or cross-validation across multiple datasets.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Conv1D layers, GRU layers, and hyperparameter optimization to overall performance.
2. Validate the model's performance on additional network intrusion datasets (e.g., CICIDS2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018) to assess generalizability beyond NSL-KDD.
3. Perform a computational cost analysis of the Random Search + Hyperband approach versus simpler hyperparameter tuning methods to evaluate practical feasibility.
