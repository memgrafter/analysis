- Primary result: Automated generation of massive "clean" empirical theorems using strong relevant logics to address LLM pre-training data exhaustion

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel solution to the problem of pre-training data exhaustion for large language models (LLMs) through automated generation of empirical theorems using forward reasoning based on strong relevant logics (SRLs). The approach uses FreeEnCal, a forward reasoning engine, to generate formal theories in SRL fragments, ensuring data quality by preventing meaningless or contradictory theorems. The method addresses both Automated Theorem Finding (ATF) and Automated Knowledge Appreciation (AKA) problems through a two-stage process that first generates SRL logic fragments and then derives empirical theorems.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves using FreeEnCal, a forward reasoning engine, to generate empirical theorems in formal theories based on strong relevant logics (SRLs) through a two-stage process. First, SRL logic fragments are generated from axioms and inference rules by specifying nesting degree parameters. Second, these fragments along with empirical axioms are used to derive empirical theorems through iterative forward reasoning. The approach ensures data quality by leveraging SRLs' ability to prevent paradoxes and contradictions while enabling massive scalable generation of training data suitable for LLM pre-training.

## Key Results
- Strong relevant logics (SRLs) can generate "clean" empirical theorems by excluding irrelevant or contradictory content
- Forward reasoning via FreeEnCal automates massive empirical theorem generation from small premise sets
- Modular SRL fragment generation allows control over data scale and complexity through nesting degree parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Strong relevant logics (SRLs) enable generation of "clean" empirical theorems by excluding irrelevant or contradictory content.
- Mechanism: SRLs reject both implicational paradoxes and conjunction/disjunction-implicational paradoxes, ensuring generated theorems are logically valid and non-contradictory.
- Core assumption: The strong relevance principle (every propositional variable occurs as both antecedent and consequent) filters out meaningless or circular derivations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The approach ensures data quality through the use of strong relevant logics, which prevent the generation of meaningless or contradictory theorems."
  - [section] "SRLs can satisfy the above three essential requirements for the fundamental logic system to underlie ATF and AKA."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for SRL-specific filtering claims; assumed from cited literature.
- Break condition: If premises contain hidden contradictions or if the SRL fragment degree is too high, filtering may fail and generate spurious theorems.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Forward reasoning via FreeEnCal automates massive empirical theorem generation from a small set of premises.
- Mechanism: FreeEnCal performs iterative application of inference rules over SRL fragments to derive new formulas, building a formal theory incrementally.
- Core assumption: Inference rules in the SRL fragment are sound and complete for the intended fragment; premises are sufficient to seed meaningful derivations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using FreeEnCal, a forward reasoning engine developed by the authors, to generate empirical theorems in formal theories based on strong relevant logics (SRLs)."
  - [section] "FreeEnCal can interpret and perform inference rules defined and given by its users, draw fragments of various logic systems specified by its users, draw empirical theorems of various formal theories constructed based on various logic systems, and perform deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning automatically."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for scalability or runtime performance.
- Break condition: If inference rules are too weak or premises too sparse, generation stalls; if rules are too permissive, output becomes noisy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modular SRL fragment generation allows control over data scale and complexity.
- Mechanism: By adjusting nesting degrees of connectives, one can tune the size and difficulty of the theorem space, balancing computational load and data richness.
- Core assumption: The degree parameters directly map to logical depth and thus to computational effort and theorem diversity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Determine the allowable nesting degree of the logical connectives for generating the fundamental logic system fragments according to the required data scale requirements."
  - [section] "The kth degree fragment of L... is a set of logical theorems of L which is inductively defined... (1) if A is an axiom of L and D⇒(A) ≤ k..."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for the degree-to-scale mapping; assumption from paper's own design.
- Break condition: Excessive degree inflates fragment size exponentially, making forward reasoning intractable; too low a degree yields trivial theorems.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Relevance Logic vs Classical Logic
  - Why needed here: Understanding why SRLs are chosen over classical logic (to avoid irrelevant or contradictory theorems).
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between classical and relevant validity criteria?

- Concept: Forward Reasoning vs Backward Reasoning
  - Why needed here: FreeEnCal uses forward chaining to generate theorems, not to prove conjectures; this changes how data is produced.
  - Quick check question: In forward reasoning, what drives the generation of new theorems?

- Concept: Formal Theory Structure
  - Why needed here: Empirical theorems are derived within a formal theory (logical part + empirical part); knowing this split clarifies what is being generated.
  - Quick check question: How does a formal theory with premises partition its formulas?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Premise Input Module → FreeEnCal Engine → SRL Fragment Generator → Theorem Output Store
  - Bidirectional NL ⇄ Logical Formula Converter (auxiliary)
- Critical path:
  1. Load premises and select SRL fragment degree.
  2. Generate SRL fragment axioms + inference rules.
  3. Feed fragment + premises to FreeEnCal.
  4. Iterate forward reasoning until stopping condition.
  5. Export empirical theorems.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher degree → richer data but exponential blowup.
  - Narrower premise set → cleaner theorems but less diversity.
  - Faster inference rules → quicker generation but risk of noise.
- Failure signatures:
  - Stalled generation: too restrictive fragment or premises.
  - Noisy output: too permissive rules or high degree.
  - Out-of-memory: fragment size explosion.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run FreeEnCal with degree 1 fragment and minimal axioms; verify only tautologies appear.
  2. Increase degree to 2; check for emergence of non-trivial empirical theorems.
  3. Introduce a small contradictory premise; confirm no explosion occurs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific metrics and evaluation criteria used to measure the "interestingness" of the generated empirical theorems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that measuring interestingness is important for ATF but doesn't provide specific metrics
- Why unresolved: The paper references other works that discuss this topic but doesn't provide a definitive framework for evaluating theorem interestingness
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed methodology for evaluating the interestingness of generated theorems, including specific metrics and validation results

### Open Question 2
- How does the FreeEnCal system handle the transformation between natural language expressions and logical formulas in both directions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "a natural language <=> logical formula bidirectional automatic transformation tool is also needed" but doesn't describe how this is implemented
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a necessary component but provides no technical details about its implementation
- What evidence would resolve it: Technical specifications of the transformation tool, including algorithms, accuracy rates, and performance metrics

### Open Question 3
- What are the computational complexity and resource requirements for generating large volumes of empirical theorems using this approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims efficiency and massiveness but doesn't provide concrete performance data
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses theoretical efficiency, it lacks empirical data on actual computational requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed performance benchmarks, including processing time, memory usage, and scaling characteristics for different theorem generation scenarios

## Limitations
- FreeEnCal implementation is not publicly available, creating a fundamental barrier to independent validation
- No empirical evidence presented regarding generation speed, computational resource requirements, or output volume scaling
- Quality assurance claims about SRLs preventing meaningless theorems lack systematic empirical validation
- Domain transferability is only theoretically described without validation in actual empirical domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The theoretical foundation of strong relevant logics and their properties (preventing paradoxes and contradictions) is well-established in the literature. The two-stage forward reasoning approach is logically coherent.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that SRLs provide cleaner data than classical logic is reasonable but lacks empirical validation. The methodology description is clear but implementation details are missing.

**Low Confidence**: The scalability claims regarding massive dataset generation and the assertion that this solves LLM pre-training data exhaustion are not supported by quantitative evidence or case studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Implement SRL Fragment Generator**: Build a prototype implementation of the SRL fragment generation algorithm with configurable nesting degrees, then verify the exponential growth pattern in fragment size and test computational limits.

2. **Empirical Quality Benchmark**: Generate theorems using both strong relevant logics and classical logic with identical premises, then conduct a blind evaluation comparing logical validity, relevance, and meaningfulness of outputs.

3. **End-to-End Data Generation Pipeline**: Create a complete pipeline from SRL fragment generation through FreeEnCal reasoning to natural language conversion, then measure generation throughput, theorem diversity, and logical consistency across multiple domains.
