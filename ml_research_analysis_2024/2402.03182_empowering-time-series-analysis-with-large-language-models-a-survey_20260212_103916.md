# Empowering Time Series Analysis with Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.03182
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03182
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-based time series analysis methods across five categories and multiple application domains

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically categorizes existing methods that leverage large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis, organizing them into five distinct approaches: direct querying, tokenization, prompt design, fine-tuning, and model integration. The paper examines applications across both general and spatial-temporal time series data in domains including finance, healthcare, traffic, and human mobility. It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how LLMs can be applied to time series problems and identifies key research opportunities for advancing this emerging field.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic categorization approach, organizing LLM-based time series analysis methods into five groups based on their interaction mechanisms with LLMs. The framework covers the full spectrum from simple direct prompting to complex fine-tuning and integration approaches. The authors analyze applications across multiple domains and time series types, providing a comprehensive overview of how different methods address specific challenges in time series analysis. The survey synthesizes findings from existing literature to create a taxonomy that serves as a reference framework for researchers and practitioners.

## Key Results
- Systematic taxonomy of LLM-based time series analysis methods across five categories
- Comprehensive coverage of applications across finance, healthcare, traffic, and human mobility domains
- Identification of key future research opportunities including interpretability, multi-modality, and domain generalization
- Framework for understanding LLM applications to both general and spatial-temporal time series data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's approach works by providing a structured framework that maps different LLM interaction strategies to specific time series analysis challenges. By categorizing methods into five distinct groups based on their interaction mechanisms, the survey enables researchers to identify which approaches are most suitable for their specific use cases. The comprehensive coverage of multiple application domains demonstrates the versatility of LLM-based approaches while the identification of future research opportunities guides the field's development. The taxonomy serves as a navigational tool for understanding the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM applications in time series analysis.

## Foundational Learning
The survey builds upon fundamental principles of both time series analysis and large language model capabilities. It leverages the understanding that LLMs can process sequential data through their attention mechanisms and natural language processing capabilities. The categorization framework is grounded in the observation that different time series analysis tasks require different interaction patterns with LLMs - from simple pattern recognition to complex temporal reasoning. The survey's foundation rests on the premise that LLMs can serve as versatile tools for time series analysis when appropriately adapted through various interaction strategies.

## Architecture Onboarding
For researchers new to this field, the survey provides a clear architectural roadmap by organizing LLM-based time series analysis methods into five progressive categories. The direct querying approach represents the simplest entry point, requiring minimal technical expertise. The tokenization and prompt design categories introduce more sophisticated interaction patterns while maintaining accessibility. The fine-tuning and model integration categories represent more advanced approaches requiring deeper technical knowledge. The survey's structure allows practitioners to start with simpler methods and progressively adopt more complex architectures as needed, while understanding the trade-offs between different approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several critical open questions that require further investigation: How can we improve the interpretability of LLM-based time series analysis methods? What are the limitations of using LLMs for different types of time series data, particularly in specialized domains? How can multi-modal approaches enhance time series analysis when combined with LLMs? What are the challenges in achieving domain generalization across different application areas? How can we develop more efficient fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific time series tasks? What are the computational trade-offs between different method categories, and how can we optimize resource utilization?

## Limitations
- Rapidly evolving nature of LLM research may result in incomplete coverage of emerging methods
- Survey does not provide quantitative performance comparisons between different method categories
- Limited empirical validation of claims about cross-domain applicability and future research directions
- The five-category taxonomy, while comprehensive, may not capture all possible interaction patterns between LLMs and time series data
- The survey focuses primarily on methodology rather than providing implementation details for practical deployment
- The analysis is largely theoretical, with limited discussion of real-world deployment challenges and constraints

## Confidence
- **Taxonomy structure**: High confidence due to logical organization and clear categorization criteria
- **Future research opportunities**: Medium confidence as these are projections rather than empirically validated findings
- **Method coverage completeness**: Medium confidence due to rapidly evolving research landscape
- **Cross-domain applicability claims**: Low to medium confidence without empirical validation across all mentioned domains
- **Practical implementation guidance**: Low confidence as the survey focuses on theoretical framework rather than practical deployment considerations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic literature searches for LLM-based time series methods published after the survey's cutoff date to assess coverage completeness
2. Implement empirical benchmarks comparing the five method categories on standardized time series datasets to validate performance claims
3. Perform cross-domain validation studies to test the survey's claims about LLM applicability across finance, healthcare, traffic, and human mobility domains
4. Develop practical implementation guidelines based on the survey's taxonomy to bridge the gap between theoretical framework and real-world deployment
5. Investigate the computational efficiency and resource requirements of different method categories to provide more comprehensive guidance for practitioners
