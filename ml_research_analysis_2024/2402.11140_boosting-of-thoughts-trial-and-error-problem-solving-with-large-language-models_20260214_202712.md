# Boosting of Thoughts: Trial-and-Error Problem Solving with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11140
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11140
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BoT achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than advanced prompting approaches on mathematical reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework that enhances large language models' reasoning capabilities on complex problems through iterative self-improvement. The approach starts with simple prompts and progressively refines them by having the LLM analyze its own reasoning errors and generate revision advice. Through repeated cycles of thought generation, error analysis, and prompt revision, BoT builds increasingly effective reasoning chains without requiring human annotations or examples.

## Method Summary
BoT operates by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating multiple trees of thoughts, using error analysis from the LLM to explicitly revise the prompt and enhance reasoning step generation. The framework begins with a simple prompt without examples and progressively builds weighted binary tree thought structures. These structures are aggregated into reasoning chains, which are then analyzed by the LLM to generate feedback containing error reports and revision advice. This accumulated experience is incorporated back into the prompt to refine weak thoughts, creating a self-improving system for complex problem solving.

## Key Results
- BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates compared to advanced prompting approaches on mathematical reasoning tasks
- The method demonstrates effective learning to reason through error analysis and experience accumulation without human annotations
- Experiments show the iterative approach can significantly improve reasoning performance from simple initial prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism leverages the LLM's own analytical capabilities to identify reasoning flaws and generate targeted improvements. By creating a feedback loop where the model critiques its own thought processes and uses those critiques to refine future reasoning attempts, BoT enables continuous improvement without external supervision. The binary tree structure allows for systematic exploration of different reasoning paths while the aggregation mechanism ensures that successful strategies are reinforced and errors are explicitly addressed in subsequent iterations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Iterative self-improvement**: Why needed - Enables continuous refinement without human intervention; Quick check - Monitor performance improvement across iterations
- **Error analysis and reporting**: Why needed - Provides concrete feedback for prompt refinement; Quick check - Verify accuracy of self-generated error reports
- **Experience accumulation**: Why needed - Builds knowledge base for future reasoning; Quick check - Track prompt evolution and reasoning quality over time
- **Tree-based reasoning exploration**: Why needed - Systematically explores multiple solution paths; Quick check - Measure diversity and quality of generated thought trees
- **Automated prompt engineering**: Why needed - Eliminates need for manual prompt design; Quick check - Compare performance with human-designed prompts
- **Self-evaluation mechanisms**: Why needed - Enables autonomous quality assessment; Quick check - Validate self-assessment accuracy against ground truth

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Initial prompt -> Thought tree generation -> Reasoning chain aggregation -> LLM error analysis -> Revision advice generation -> Prompt revision -> (loop back)

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is Initial prompt → Thought tree generation → LLM error analysis → Prompt revision, as each step builds directly on the previous one and errors compound through the pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The iterative approach trades computational efficiency for performance gains, requiring multiple inference calls per problem. The reliance on the LLM's self-evaluation capability introduces potential reliability issues but eliminates the need for human annotations. The binary tree structure provides systematic exploration but may not be optimal for all problem types.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor initial prompts may lead to suboptimal thought trees that the LLM cannot effectively analyze. Inaccurate self-evaluation can reinforce incorrect reasoning patterns. The accumulation of experience may become dominated by early failures if not properly weighted. The tree structure may struggle with problems requiring non-linear reasoning approaches.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run BoT on simple mathematical problems to establish baseline performance and iteration effectiveness
2. Compare BoT's self-generated error reports with human-annotated error analysis on the same problems
3. Test the impact of different tree depths and branching factors on reasoning quality and computational cost

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation is limited to specific problem types and may not generalize to broader reasoning domains
- The iterative nature raises questions about computational efficiency and whether performance gains justify increased inference costs
- The self-evaluation mechanism's reliability across different problem domains and model versions remains uncertain
- The method's dependence on tree structures may limit applicability to problems that don't naturally fit this format

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- Technical implementation of the BoT framework and its iterative improvement capabilities

**Medium confidence**:
- Generalizability of results across different problem types and reasoning domains
- Efficiency gains relative to computational costs

**Low confidence**:
- Absolute performance levels compared to human-designed solutions

## Next Checks

1. Test BoT on a broader range of reasoning tasks beyond mathematical problems, including logical puzzles, code generation, and multi-step decision making scenarios

2. Conduct a thorough analysis of computational efficiency by measuring the trade-off between performance gains and increased inference costs across different model sizes

3. Validate the reliability of the self-evaluation mechanism by comparing the LLM's error reports with human-annotated error analysis across diverse problem types
