## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for translating latent representations between independently trained neural models, enabling zero-shot reuse of pre-trained models. The approach combines relative representation projection with inversion to achieve latent space translation. By assuming scale invariance of decoder modules and formalizing the invertibility of angle-preserving relative representations, the method uses a relative space as an intermediary to project between semantically similar spaces. The method demonstrates high accuracy in reconstructing absolute latent spaces from relative representations and enables zero-shot stitching between arbitrary pre-trained text and image encoders and their classifiers, even across modalities.

## Method Summary
The method addresses the challenge of latent space translation by leveraging the properties of relative representations and their invertibility. It assumes that decoder modules are scale-invariant and that relative representations preserve angles, allowing for a consistent intermediary space. The approach uses this relative space to project between semantically similar latent spaces of independently trained models. By combining relative projection with inversion techniques, the method can reconstruct absolute latent spaces from relative representations, enabling zero-shot composition of pre-trained models across different modalities and architectures.

## Key Results
- High accuracy in reconstructing absolute latent spaces from relative representations
- Successful zero-shot stitching between arbitrary pre-trained text and image encoders and classifiers across modalities
- Accuracy improvements over absolute space stitching across various architectures and datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the mathematical properties of relative representations, which preserve angles and are theoretically invertible under certain conditions. By assuming scale invariance of decoder modules, the approach creates a consistent intermediary space that allows for projection between different latent spaces. The combination of relative projection and inversion enables the reconstruction of absolute representations from relative ones, facilitating the composition of independently trained models without additional training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Relative representations**: Why needed - to create a consistent intermediary space for projection; Quick check - verify angle preservation between source and target spaces
- **Scale invariance**: Why needed - to ensure consistent behavior across different model scales; Quick check - confirm decoder module responses remain unchanged under scaling
- **Inversion of relative representations**: Why needed - to reconstruct absolute representations from relative ones; Quick check - validate invertibility on synthetic data
- **Angle preservation**: Why needed - to maintain semantic relationships during translation; Quick check - measure cosine similarity consistency before and after translation

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input encoders -> Relative projection module -> Inversion module -> Output decoders
- **Critical path**: The relative projection and inversion steps are critical for accurate translation between latent spaces
- **Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead for zero-shot model composition, avoiding the need for additional training
- **Failure signatures**: Poor translation accuracy when decoder modules are not scale-invariant or when relative representations do not preserve angles
- **First experiments**: 1) Test translation accuracy on synthetic data with known ground truth; 2) Validate scale invariance assumption on pre-trained decoders; 3) Measure angle preservation between source and target latent spaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out additional open questions beyond those discussed in the limitations section.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness relies on the assumption that decoder modules are scale-invariant, which may not hold across all architectures or tasks
- Theoretical guarantees for relative representation invertibility are established under idealized conditions that may not fully capture practical scenarios
- Experiments focus primarily on text and image modalities, leaving questions about performance on other data types

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core method's ability to translate between independently trained models when assumptions hold, experimental demonstration of improved accuracy over absolute space stitching, theoretical framework for relative representation invertibility under ideal conditions
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability of results to other modalities beyond text and image, robustness to architectural variations not tested in the paper, computational efficiency claims without explicit benchmarks
- **Low confidence**: Performance in extreme cases of domain shift between pre-trained models, practical impact on real-world deployment scenarios, long-term stability of translated representations during fine-tuning

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on additional modalities such as audio, video, and multimodal data to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each assumption (e.g., scale invariance) on translation accuracy
3. Benchmark the computational overhead of relative projection and inversion steps compared to direct absolute space stitching across different model sizes and datasets
