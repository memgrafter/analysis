# Synergising Human-like Responses and Machine Intelligence for Planning in Disaster Response

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09877
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09877
- Reference count: 23
- The proposed cognitive control architecture achieves a 90% mission success rate in UAV wildfire navigation, compared to 95% for fast heuristic alone and 40% for analytical alone.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a cognitive control architecture for autonomous agents in disaster response, inspired by Dual Process Theory. The system combines fast, heuristic (human-like) decision-making with slow, analytical machine optimization, dynamically switching between them based on environmental conditions. The approach is evaluated on trajectory planning for a UAV navigating through dynamic wildfire environments, where the agent must avoid firefronts while reaching a goal region. Results show the cognitive controller achieves a 90% mission success rate, compared to 95% for the fast heuristic system alone and 40% for the analytical system alone.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a dual-process cognitive architecture where System 1 uses a sampling-based planner (RRT) for fast, heuristic path generation, and System 2 employs Model Predictive Control (MPC) with mixed-integer quadratic programming for optimized trajectory planning. A supervisory controller dynamically allocates control between the two systems by monitoring three attributes—response time, mission completion time, and energy efficiency—using a probabilistic attention mechanism. The controller uses Dirichlet distribution sampling to generate attention probabilities that guide system selection based on mission context, such as fire proximity and elapsed time.

## Key Results
- The cognitive controller achieves 90% mission success rate in UAV wildfire navigation scenarios.
- System 1 alone achieves 95% success rate but with suboptimal energy efficiency and mission completion times.
- System 2 alone achieves only 40% success rate due to computational delays in dynamic firefront scenarios.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The supervisory controller dynamically allocates control between System 1 and System 2 by monitoring three attributes—response time, mission completion time, and energy efficiency—using a probabilistic attention mechanism. At each time step, the controller computes a performance matrix Q for the two systems across the three attributes, then uses time-varying attention parameters ξ(t) to weight these attributes according to mission context (e.g., fire proximity, elapsed time). A Dirichlet distribution generates attention probabilities, which are used to sample an attention vector A indicating which attribute to prioritize. This drives a state-space decision model that updates a decision score Ψt for each system, and the system with the higher score is selected for the next control step.

### Mechanism 2
System 1 (heuristic/RAPID) provides fast trajectory generation suitable for near-firefront scenarios, while System 2 (analytical/MPC) optimizes for mission completion time or energy efficiency in safer conditions. System 1 uses a sampling-based planner (similar to RRT) to quickly produce a collision-free path to the goal. System 2 solves a mixed-integer quadratic program over a receding horizon, balancing path length and energy use via a weighted objective. The supervisory controller switches to System 1 when firefronts are close (high ξ1), and to System 2 when distance to firefronts is large (high ξ2 or ξ3).

### Mechanism 3
The dynamic attention parameters ξ(t) evolve according to sigmoid-like functions of time and distance to firefronts, allowing the controller to shift focus from speed (early mission, near fire) to efficiency (late mission, far from fire). ξ1(t) increases with decreasing distance to the nearest firefront; ξ2(t) decreases with mission elapsed time (initial priority on mission time); ξ3(t) increases with mission elapsed time (later priority on energy). These are combined into a Dirichlet distribution that governs the attention probabilities for the three attributes, enabling the supervisory controller to adapt its focus over the mission.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dual Process Theory (DPT)
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical framework for combining fast, intuitive decision-making (System 1) with slow, analytical optimization (System 2) in a unified architecture.
  - Quick check question: What are the defining characteristics of System 1 vs. System 2 in DPT, and why is each suitable for different phases of disaster response?

- Concept: Model Predictive Control (MPC)
  - Why needed here: Enables System 2 to generate optimal trajectories by solving a constrained optimization problem over a receding horizon, balancing mission time and energy efficiency.
  - Quick check question: How does MPC handle constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) and what is the role of the weighting matrices in the objective function?

- Concept: Probabilistic Attention Mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Allows the supervisory controller to dynamically allocate focus to the most relevant attribute (response time, mission time, or energy efficiency) based on mission context, using a Dirichlet distribution to model uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: Why use a Dirichlet distribution for attention probabilities, and how does sampling from it enable adaptive system selection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: UAV Dynamics Model -> Firefront Model -> System 1 (RRT + LQR) -> System 2 (MPC + MIQP) -> Supervisory Controller -> Attention Mechanism -> Decision Dynamics

- Critical path: 1. Observe UAV state and firefront positions. 2. Compute System 1 and System 2 candidate trajectories. 3. Evaluate performance on three attributes → Q matrix. 4. Sample attention vector A via Dirichlet distribution. 5. Update decision scores Ψt for each system. 6. Select system St = arg max Ψt(i). 7. Execute chosen trajectory for one step, repeat.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. optimality: System 1 is fast but suboptimal; System 2 is optimal but slower.
  - Simplicity vs. adaptability: Fixed rule switching is simpler but less flexible than probabilistic attention.
  - Computational load: System 2's MIQP is heavy; may require simplification or approximation for real-time use.
  - Parameter tuning: Attention functions and performance matrix Q must be carefully tuned to the mission profile.

- Failure signatures:
  - Oscillatory switching between systems due to poorly tuned attention parameters.
  - System 1 failing to find a collision-free path (e.g., in cluttered firefront scenarios).
  - System 2 exceeding its time budget, causing the UAV to remain idle and risk firefront proximity.
  - Attention mechanism always selecting one attribute, ignoring changing mission needs.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulate a static firefront scenario with no time pressure; verify that System 2 is selected and produces the optimal (shortest-time) trajectory.
  2. Simulate a rapidly emerging firefront near the UAV; verify that System 1 is selected and the UAV escapes before the fire arrives.
  3. Simulate a long-duration mission with no firefronts; verify that attention shifts from mission time to energy efficiency, and System 2 is used for the majority of the mission.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the proposed cognitive controller compare when using alternative methods to represent System 1, such as learning-based techniques instead of the RRT-based approach?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that while the RRT methodology is used to represent System 1, alternative techniques with similar characteristics can also be employed.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the proposed approach using the RRT-based method for System 1, leaving the impact of alternative representations unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different System 1 representations (e.g., learning-based methods) and evaluating their performance against the proposed approach in terms of mission success rate, completion time, and energy efficiency.

### Open Question 2
How does the proposed approach scale with an increasing number of firefronts and a larger disaster environment?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a 1 km × 1 km environment with a dynamically varying number of firefronts. However, the scalability to larger environments and a higher number of firefronts is not explicitly addressed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide results or analysis on the performance of the proposed approach in scenarios with a larger number of firefronts or a more extensive disaster environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the proposed approach in larger environments with a higher number of firefronts, measuring performance metrics such as mission success rate, completion time, and energy efficiency.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the performance of the proposed approach to the choice of hyperparameters in the attention mechanism and decision-making dynamics?
- Basis in paper: The paper provides specific hyperparameter values for the attention mechanism and decision-making dynamics, but it does not explore the sensitivity of the approach to variations in these parameters.
- Why unresolved: The impact of different hyperparameter choices on the performance of the proposed approach is not investigated, leaving uncertainty about the robustness of the method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis experiments that vary the hyperparameters in the attention mechanism and decision-making dynamics, evaluating the resulting performance of the proposed approach in terms of mission success rate, completion time, and energy efficiency.

## Limitations
- The attention parameters ξ(t) are heuristically defined rather than derived from empirical data, making the system potentially brittle to environments that deviate from assumed mission priorities.
- The computational demands of the MIQP in System 2 may limit real-time applicability on resource-constrained UAV platforms.
- The comparison to baseline systems is limited to success rates and does not include ablation studies or robustness testing under noisy or adversarial firefront dynamics.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism for dynamically switching between fast heuristic and slow analytical planning based on environmental conditions is well-supported by the experimental results (90% success rate).
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation of the attention mechanism and its impact on mission performance, as the exact parameter tuning and evaluation methodology are not fully specified.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the attention parameter functions ξ(t) to other disaster scenarios or UAV types, as these are tailored to the specific wildfire navigation task presented.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Remove the attention mechanism and replace it with fixed rules (e.g., always use System 1 near fire, System 2 far away) to quantify the benefit of dynamic switching.
2. **Robustness testing**: Introduce noise into firefront propagation or UAV dynamics and measure the impact on mission success and switching behavior.
3. **Scalability analysis**: Test the system on larger, more complex disaster environments (e.g., urban fires with multiple UAVs) to assess computational feasibility and performance degradation.
