# Regression with Multi-Expert Deferral

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.19494
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19494
- Authors: Anqi Mao; Mehryar Mohri; Yutao Zhong

- Key outcome: Novel framework for regression with multi-expert deferral, introducing new surrogate loss functions and H-consistency bounds for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for regression with deferral, allowing a learner to defer predictions to multiple experts. The authors present comprehensive analyses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios, introducing new surrogate loss functions supported by H-consistency bounds. These bounds provide stronger consistency guarantees than Bayes consistency, as they are non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific. The framework is versatile, accommodating multiple experts, bounded regression losses, instance-dependent and label-dependent costs, and both single-stage and two-stage methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, showing improved performance over base models when deferring to multiple experts.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive framework for regression with multi-expert deferral, addressing both single-stage and two-stage scenarios. The framework introduces new surrogate loss functions designed to optimize the deferral process, along with H-consistency bounds that provide stronger consistency guarantees than traditional Bayes consistency. These bounds are non-asymptotic and specific to the hypothesis set used, offering more practical and robust performance guarantees. The framework is designed to be flexible, accommodating multiple experts, various types of regression losses, and different cost structures. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms across different scenarios and datasets.

## Key Results
- Introduction of a novel framework for regression with multi-expert deferral
- New surrogate loss functions with H-consistency bounds
- Improved performance over base models in extensive experiments
- Versatility in accommodating multiple experts, bounded regression losses, and various cost structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by allowing the learner to defer predictions to multiple experts, leveraging their specialized knowledge while maintaining control over the final output. The new surrogate loss functions are designed to optimize this deferral process, balancing the trade-off between using the learner's own predictions and deferring to experts. The H-consistency bounds provide strong theoretical guarantees, ensuring that the learned model converges to the optimal solution within the given hypothesis set. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where experts have complementary strengths or when the learner faces uncertainty about the input data.

## Foundational Learning
- H-consistency bounds: Why needed - Provides stronger consistency guarantees than Bayes consistency; Quick check - Ensure bounds are non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific
- Surrogate loss functions: Why needed - Optimizes the deferral process; Quick check - Verify the loss functions are designed for multi-expert scenarios
- Multi-expert deferral: Why needed - Leverages specialized knowledge from multiple sources; Quick check - Confirm the framework can handle multiple experts with different strengths

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Learner -> Surrogate Loss Functions -> H-consistency Bounds -> Deferral Mechanism -> Multiple Experts

Critical Path:
The critical path involves the learner using the surrogate loss functions to make deferral decisions, guided by the H-consistency bounds, and then interacting with the multiple experts through the deferral mechanism.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework balances the trade-off between using the learner's own predictions and deferring to experts. It also considers the computational complexity of handling multiple experts and the potential for increased variance in predictions.

Failure Signatures:
Potential failures may occur when experts provide conflicting advice, when the deferral mechanism is unable to accurately assess expert reliability, or when the hypothesis set is too restrictive to capture the true underlying function.

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate the framework on a simple regression task with two experts of known reliability
2. Test the framework's performance with varying numbers of experts and different cost structures
3. Assess the impact of the H-consistency bounds on the convergence rate of the learned model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees may not translate well to practical applications with complex, high-dimensional data
- Performance in real-world scenarios with noisy expert predictions or adversarial experts is not explicitly addressed
- Scalability to large-scale problems with many experts is not thoroughly investigated

## Confidence

High confidence in the theoretical contributions: The paper provides rigorous mathematical formulations and proofs for the proposed framework, including new surrogate loss functions and H-consistency bounds. The theoretical underpinnings appear sound and well-established.

Medium confidence in practical applicability: While the experiments demonstrate improved performance over base models, the real-world applicability of the framework remains to be seen. The performance may vary significantly depending on the specific domain, dataset characteristics, and expert quality.

Low confidence in scalability: The paper does not explicitly address the scalability of the proposed methods to large-scale problems or datasets. As the number of experts increases, the computational complexity and memory requirements may become prohibitive.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework on a diverse set of real-world datasets with varying characteristics, including high-dimensional data, noisy expert predictions, and adversarial scenarios.

2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components of the framework, such as the choice of surrogate loss functions, hypothesis sets, and cost functions.

3. Investigate the scalability of the proposed methods by testing their performance on large-scale datasets with a significant number of experts and instances. Assess the computational complexity and memory requirements as the problem size increases.
