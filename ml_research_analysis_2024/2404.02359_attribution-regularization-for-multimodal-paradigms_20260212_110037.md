# Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359

- Primary result: Novel attribution-based regularization technique that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities during decision-making

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of modality dominance in multimodal learning, where models tend to overly rely on a single modality when making decisions. The authors propose a novel attribution-based regularization technique that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities during decision-making. The method calculates modality attributions using the gradient-input product technique and introduces a regularization term that promotes balanced attribution across modalities. Experiments on VGGSound and CREMA-D video classification datasets show that while the proposed attribution regularization helps balance modality contributions, it yields minimal improvements in traditional evaluation metrics like accuracy and mAP. The results suggest that while modality dominance is reduced, additional evaluation methods may be needed to fully capture the benefits of this approach.

## Method Summary
The method computes modality attributions using the gradient-input product (GRAD ⊙ INPUT) technique, where gradients of the maximum classifier output with respect to each modality's encoder output are multiplied by the corresponding encoder outputs and pooled to scalar values. These scalar attributions are normalized across modalities and used to construct a regularization term that encourages the model to distribute decision-making influence in a specified ratio across modalities. The regularization is applied only to the fusion and classifier layers while the encoders are trained separately. The loss function combines the standard task loss with the attribution regularization term, optimized using separate optimizers to avoid interfering with encoder training.

## Key Results
- Attribution regularization reduces modality dominance from 74/26 to 50/50 audio/video attribution ratios
- Minimal improvements observed in traditional metrics (accuracy, mAP) despite balanced modality contributions
- Method shows promise for embodied AI research involving multiple modalities
- Results indicate current evaluation metrics may not fully capture the benefits of balanced modality utilization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gradient-input product (GRAD ⊙ INPUT) provides a comparable scalar attribution score per modality by normalizing gradients with respect to each modality's input scale.
- Mechanism: The method computes ∂(maxf(e))/∂ei ⊙ ei for each modality's encoder output ei, then L2-pools to a scalar and normalizes across modalities. This yields a relative measure of each modality's contribution to the final decision that is comparable despite differing input scales.
- Core assumption: Modality attributions computed after the encoder but before fusion accurately reflect the influence of each modality on the classifier's decision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We use this to compute a comparative attribution value per each modality... the scales of inputs from different modalities cannot be compared directly."
  - [section] "To compute the attributions (α) using the GRAD ⊙ INPUT technique... we need to pool this attribution vector to have a scalar value of attribution per modality."
- Break condition: If the fusion or classifier layer transforms modality contributions in a way that breaks the linearity assumption implicit in gradient attribution, the computed attributions will not reflect true decision influence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Regularizing the ratio of modality attributions to a target distribution reduces modality dominance by penalizing imbalance in the classifier/fusion layers.
- Mechanism: The regularization term adds MX i=0 (ai/PM j=0 aj - ri/PM j=0 rj)² to the loss, where ai are normalized attributions and ri are target ratios. This encourages the model to distribute attention more evenly across modalities during decision-making.
- Core assumption: The model can learn to redistribute decision-making influence across modalities through classifier/fusion layer updates without harming task performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The modality attributions give us information about how much information from each modality was considered in making a decision. This can be used to come up with a regularizer term that encourages the model to consider information from modalities in a certain proportion."
  - [abstract] "The method calculates modality attributions using the gradient-input product technique and introduces a regularization term that promotes balanced attribution across modalities."
- Break condition: If the regularization strength is too high, it may force the model to use suboptimal modality combinations, degrading accuracy despite achieving balanced attributions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Separating the optimization of the regularizer term from the main task loss allows targeted adjustment of classifier/fusion behavior without interfering with encoder learning.
- Mechanism: The attribution regularization is optimized using a separate optimizer that does not affect encoder parameters, allowing focused adjustment of how modalities are combined at the decision level.
- Core assumption: Encoder parameters can be effectively trained without attribution regularization while still benefiting from improved modality balance at the fusion/classifier level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "While implementing this in popular ML frameworks like PyTorch, this may need to be optimized using a separate optimizer as the regular optimizer also effects the encoder layers."
  - [section] "As attribution is not related to the encoder part of the model, the above regularizer should only be used to optimize fusion and classifier layers."
- Break condition: If encoder and fusion/classifier layers are too tightly coupled, separating their optimization may lead to suboptimal overall model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gradient-based attribution methods (like GRAD ⊙ INPUT)
  - Why needed here: These methods provide a way to quantify how much each modality contributes to the final prediction, which is essential for designing the regularization term that balances modality contributions.
  - Quick check question: How does GRAD ⊙ INPUT differ from other gradient-based attribution methods like Integrated Gradients or Grad-CAM?

- Concept: Multimodal fusion strategies (early, late, hybrid)
  - Why needed here: Understanding different fusion approaches is crucial because the regularization technique specifically targets the fusion and classifier layers where modality contributions are combined.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between early fusion (concatenation) and late fusion (separate classifiers then combined) in terms of modality dominance?

- Concept: Regularization techniques in deep learning
  - Why needed here: The attribution regularization is a novel form of regularization that requires understanding how regularization terms affect optimization dynamics and model behavior.
  - Quick check question: How does adding a regularization term to the loss function change the optimization landscape compared to standard supervised learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder layers (per modality) → Fusion layer → Classifier → Output. Attribution regularization is applied at the output of encoder layers but optimized only at fusion/classifier layers.
- Critical path: Modality input → Encoder → Attribution calculation → Fusion → Classifier → Output → Loss (task + attribution regularization)
- Design tradeoffs: Separating optimizer for attribution regularization avoids interfering with encoder training but adds complexity; balancing regularization strength vs. task performance requires careful tuning.
- Failure signatures: If modality dominance persists, attributions will remain highly skewed despite regularization; if task performance drops significantly, the regularization may be too strong or the target ratios inappropriate.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with naive end-to-end approach to establish baseline modality dominance and accuracy
  2. Apply attribution regularization with target equal ratios (1/M for each modality) and monitor attribution balance
  3. Vary regularization strength (λ) to find the optimal balance between attribution balance and task performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the effectiveness of the attribution regularization term be properly evaluated beyond traditional metrics like accuracy and mAP?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "it is important to note that the impact of the new regularization term may not be adequately captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy alone" and "further investigation is required to develop and employ evaluation techniques that can effectively assess the benefits of equal attribution facilitated by the regularization term."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that while the regularization reduces modality dominance, it yields minimal improvements in traditional metrics, suggesting current evaluation methods may not capture the intended benefits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new evaluation metrics specifically designed to measure balanced modality utilization, followed by experimental results showing these metrics correlate with the intended benefits of attribution regularization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the attribution regularization technique generalize to other multimodal domains beyond video-audio classification, such as text-image or multimodal question answering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved" but note they need to "replicate these experiments on the CREMA-D dataset" and only tested on VGGSound and CREMA-D.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to video-audio classification tasks, leaving uncertainty about the technique's applicability to other multimodal settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful replication of the attribution regularization approach on diverse multimodal datasets (text-image, audio-text, etc.) showing consistent improvements in balanced modality utilization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal ratio (r1, r2, ..., rM) for the regularization term that balances modality contributions in different tasks and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a regularizer function where "we want the model to have modality attributions in the ratio (r1, r2, .., rM)" but do not specify how to determine these optimal ratios.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the regularization framework but leaves the determination of optimal modality contribution ratios as an open problem, suggesting it may vary by task or dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments across multiple tasks and datasets identifying patterns or guidelines for setting optimal modality attribution ratios based on task characteristics or dataset properties.

## Limitations

- Minimal improvements in traditional evaluation metrics (accuracy, mAP) despite balanced modality contributions
- Attribution regularization mechanism relies on gradient linearity assumptions that may not hold for complex fusion/classifier layers
- Optimal target attribution ratios are not specified and may vary by task and dataset
- Limited validation to only two video-audio classification datasets

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodology for computing gradient-input product attributions and implementing the regularization term is clearly specified and technically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that modality dominance is reduced is supported by the reported attribution ratios, though the practical significance of this balance is unclear given minimal performance gains.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that the method yields "minimal improvements in traditional evaluation metrics" is based on results from only two datasets, and the paper does not explore whether different target attribution ratios might yield better performance.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the attribution regularization on additional multimodal datasets (e.g., AVSpeech, CMU-MOSEI) to verify that modality balance improvements generalize beyond VGGSound and CREMA-D.
2. **Ablation on regularization strength**: Systematically vary the regularization weight λ across multiple orders of magnitude to identify if stronger regularization might yield both balanced attributions and improved accuracy.
3. **Alternative evaluation metrics**: Implement evaluation methods that specifically measure modality complementarity (e.g., redundancy analysis, conditional entropy between modalities) to determine if balanced attributions translate to better multimodal information utilization even when accuracy gains are minimal.
