# REVECA: Adaptive Planning and Trajectory-based Validation in Cooperative Language Agents using Information Relevance and Relative Proximity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16751
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16751
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: REVECA framework addresses information overload, suboptimal planning, and false planning in multi-agent environments through Relevance Estimation, Adaptive Planning, and Trajectory-based Validation

## Executive Summary
REVECA introduces a cognitive architecture designed to enhance cooperative language agents operating in multi-agent environments with decentralized control and partial observability. The framework tackles critical challenges including information overload, suboptimal planning, and false planning by implementing three core mechanisms: Relevance Estimation to prioritize task-relevant information, Adaptive Planning to generate globally optimal plans using relative proximity metrics, and Trajectory-based Validation to prevent false plans by inferring collaborator interactions. The architecture demonstrates superior performance across three partial-observable environments and one fully-observable game environment, achieving higher success rates, improved efficiency, and greater robustness compared to baseline approaches. User studies validate REVECA's effectiveness in human-AI collaboration, highlighting its ability to manage noise and reduce unnecessary communication while maintaining trust and performance.

## Method Summary
The REVECA framework implements a three-component cognitive architecture for cooperative language agents. Relevance Estimation filters incoming information to identify task-critical data, reducing the cognitive load on agents operating in information-rich environments. Adaptive Planning generates optimal action sequences by incorporating relative proximity metrics between agents and objects, enabling more informed decision-making in decentralized scenarios. Trajectory-based Validation prevents false planning by analyzing potential collaborator interactions before committing to action sequences. The framework processes information through these components sequentially, with each stage refining the agent's understanding and planning capabilities before execution.

## Key Results
- REVECA achieves higher success rates compared to baseline approaches across multiple environment types
- The framework demonstrates improved efficiency with reduced computational overhead in planning tasks
- User studies confirm enhanced trust and reduced communication requirements in human-AI collaboration scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
REVECA addresses the fundamental challenges of cooperative multi-agent systems by implementing a hierarchical information processing approach. The Relevance Estimation component filters out noise and non-essential information, allowing agents to focus computational resources on critical task elements. Adaptive Planning leverages relative proximity metrics to create more informed action sequences that account for the spatial and temporal relationships between agents and objects. Trajectory-based Validation serves as a verification mechanism that prevents agents from committing to plans that would conflict with potential collaborator actions, reducing the likelihood of failed coordination attempts.

## Foundational Learning
- Relevance Estimation: A mechanism for filtering and prioritizing information based on task relevance. Why needed: Prevents cognitive overload in information-rich environments. Quick check: Measure information processing efficiency before and after filtering.
- Relative Proximity Metrics: Quantitative measures of spatial and temporal relationships between agents and objects. Why needed: Enables more informed planning decisions based on environmental context. Quick check: Compare planning outcomes with and without proximity considerations.
- Trajectory-based Validation: A verification process that analyzes potential collaborator interactions before plan execution. Why needed: Prevents coordination failures due to conflicting action sequences. Quick check: Measure success rates of validated vs. non-validated plans.
- Decentralized Control Adaptation: Mechanisms for autonomous decision-making in the absence of central coordination. Why needed: Enables scalable multi-agent systems without communication bottlenecks. Quick check: Test performance under varying communication constraints.
- Partial Observability Management: Techniques for decision-making under incomplete information. Why needed: Reflects real-world scenarios where agents have limited environmental awareness. Quick check: Evaluate performance across different levels of environmental visibility.
- Human-AI Collaboration Metrics: Quantitative measures of trust and communication efficiency in mixed human-agent teams. Why needed: Ensures practical applicability in real-world deployment scenarios. Quick check: Compare communication overhead and trust ratings with baseline approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Information -> Relevance Estimation -> Adaptive Planning -> Trajectory-based Validation -> Action Execution

Critical Path:
The critical execution path follows the sequential flow from information input through each processing stage to final action execution. Each component must complete its processing before the next can begin, creating a pipeline where delays in early stages propagate downstream.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework prioritizes accuracy and coordination over raw processing speed, accepting increased computational overhead in exchange for reduced failure rates and improved collaborative outcomes. The sequential architecture simplifies debugging and component isolation but may introduce latency in time-critical applications.

Failure Signatures:
Common failure modes include relevance estimation errors leading to missed critical information, proximity metric calculation inaccuracies causing suboptimal planning, and trajectory validation failures resulting in coordination conflicts. These failures typically manifest as reduced success rates, increased communication overhead, or plan execution failures.

First Experiments:
1. Test relevance estimation accuracy by measuring information retention rates and task success correlation
2. Evaluate adaptive planning performance by comparing success rates with and without proximity metrics
3. Validate trajectory-based validation effectiveness by measuring coordination failure rates before and after implementation

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Domain Transferability: Test REVECA's performance in environments with fundamentally different dynamics from those used in the original evaluation, particularly focusing on domains with higher uncertainty and more complex agent interactions.

2. Communication Efficiency Analysis: Conduct controlled experiments varying communication bandwidth and frequency constraints to quantify REVECA's performance degradation and compare it with alternative approaches under communication-limited scenarios.

3. Long-term Planning Robustness: Implement extended simulation runs with dynamic goal changes and measure how well REVECA's trajectory-based validation adapts to evolving plans and whether it maintains its performance advantages over time.
