# Privacy-hardened and hallucination-resistant synthetic data generation with logic-solvers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.16705
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16705
- Reference count: 0
- Outperforms existing methods by 84-93% in accuracy and 95-98% in privacy, while being 1000-1600 times more efficient

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Genomator, a logic-based approach using SAT solvers to generate synthetic genomic data that is both private and accurate. The method addresses the challenge of creating realistic, scalable synthetic data for AI training and research while maintaining privacy and computational efficiency. Genomator outperforms existing methods (Markov chains, GANs, RBMs, and CRBMs) by 84-93% in accuracy and 95-98% in privacy, while being 1000-1600 times more efficient. It uniquely allows tuning the accuracy-privacy trade-off through parameters N and Z, and includes a Reverse Genomator tool for deductive privacy assessment. The approach successfully replicates population-specific pharmacogenetic SNP frequencies and scales to whole genomes, making it suitable for clinical and research applications.

## Method Summary
Genomator encodes genomic variation as Boolean variables and pairwise constraints, using SAT solvers to generate data consistent with all clauses. The method scans input clusters, records which pairs of nucleotide states do not occur together, and adds disjunctive clauses that forbid those pairs in the synthetic output. A key innovation is signature deduplication, which compresses the problem by assigning unique binary variables only to unique presence/absence patterns, enabling whole-genome scale processing. The Reverse Genomator tool enables deductive privacy assessment by inverting the SAT constraints to identify potential input genomes.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84-93% higher accuracy than existing methods (Markov chains, GANs, RBMs, CRBMs) in preserving linkage disequilibrium structure
- Provides 95-98% better privacy protection by preventing synthetic genomes from reproducing exact feature pairs found in only one real genome
- Processes whole genomes with 11 million SNPs 1000-1600 times faster than competing approaches while using minimal memory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SAT-based constraint generation avoids feature pairs not present in the original data, ensuring privacy.
- Mechanism: Genomator encodes genomic variation as Boolean variables and pairwise constraints. It scans the input cluster, records which pairs of nucleotide states do not occur together, and adds disjunctive clauses that forbid those pairs in the synthetic output. The SAT solver then generates data consistent with all clauses.
- Core assumption: Genomic privacy is preserved if synthetic genomes never reproduce any exact feature pair that exists in only one real genome (or up to Z genomes).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deduplication of signatures limits SAT variable count and preserves tractability for whole-genome scale.
- Mechanism: After querying all possible nucleotide variants at each position, signatures (binary presence/absence vectors) are grouped by identity. Only one SAT variable is assigned per unique signature; its inverse handles the "not present" case. This compresses the problem from ~11 million variables to ~512 for a cluster of size 10.
- Core assumption: All queries sharing the same signature must be answered identically in any consistent synthetic genome; therefore they can be represented by one variable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reverse Genomator enables deductive privacy assessment by inverting the SAT constraints.
- Mechanism: Given a synthetic genome, Reverse Genomator constructs a SAT problem whose variables represent inclusion of each real genome in the candidate input set. Constraints ensure that any candidate set could have produced the synthetic genome under Genomator's rules. Solving yields all possible input sets; genomes appearing in all sets are deemed exposed.
- Core assumption: The attacker knows the full real dataset and the exact Genomator parameters; under these conditions, membership can be inferred with certainty from synthetic output.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
  - Why needed here: Genomator's core algorithm reduces the genomic generation problem to a SAT instance; understanding variable assignment, clauses, and solver behavior is essential to reason about correctness and performance.
  - Quick check question: If a SAT formula contains only 2-literal clauses, is it always solvable in polynomial time?
    - Answer: Yes; 2-SAT is solvable in polynomial time, whereas general SAT is NP-complete.

- Concept: Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and pairwise correlation structure
  - Why needed here: Accuracy is measured by how well synthetic genomes preserve local SNP correlations; knowing what LD represents and how it's quantified (e.g., r²) is needed to interpret results and guide parameter tuning.
  - Quick check question: What does an r² value of 1 between two SNPs indicate?
    - Answer: Perfect correlation; one SNP's allele state completely determines the other's.

- Concept: Differential Privacy (DP) and membership inference
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts Genomator's deductive privacy measurement with DP-based privacy; understanding the difference between attribute inference and membership inference is crucial for evaluating privacy claims.
  - Quick check question: In membership inference, what does the attacker aim to determine?
    - Answer: Whether a specific individual's data was part of the training set.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input VCF → Signature builder → Signature deduplicator → SAT constraint generator → SAT solver → Genome resolver → Output VCF
- Critical path: 1. Cluster selection (N genomes by Hamming distance) 2. Signature construction and deduplication 3. Constraint generation (size-2 and size-4 clauses) 4. SAT solving 5. Genome reconstruction
- Design tradeoffs: N vs Z: Larger N relaxes constraints (higher accuracy, lower privacy); larger Z strengthens privacy by randomizing attenuation of rare pairs. Runtime vs privacy: SAT solving is fast for small N but becomes slower as N grows; high Z may require higher N to keep the problem satisfiable. Accuracy vs scalability: Full-genome generation is only tractable because of signature deduplication; without it, variable count would be prohibitive.
- Failure signatures: SAT UNSAT: Cluster too small or Z too large; try increasing N or decreasing Z. Runtime explosion: N approaching 2^9 signatures; consider reducing N or clustering more aggressively. Poor LD reproduction: Check that constraint generation correctly forbids all absent pairs; verify signature deduplication is correct.
- First 3 experiments: 1. Run Genomator on a small synthetic VCF (e.g., 10 SNPs, 5 samples) with N=3, Z=0; verify output never contains a pair absent from input. 2. Repeat with Z=1 and compare the set of forbidden pairs; observe which rare pairs are now allowed. 3. Use Reverse Genomator on the output from (1) to confirm that genomes appearing in all candidate sets are exactly those in the original cluster.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the practical limit of scalability for Genomator when processing whole-genome datasets with 11 million SNPs, considering memory constraints and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states Genomator can process 11 million SNPs using a single-thread CPU and minimal RAM, but does not specify exact memory usage limits.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed benchmarks on memory usage for different input sizes beyond the 11 million SNP threshold.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical tests showing memory usage and runtime for input sizes ranging from 11 million to 20 million SNPs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does Genomator's performance compare to other methods when applied to non-genomic datasets, such as financial or biomedical time-series data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential for extending Genomator's SAT constraints to non-genomic domains but does not provide experimental results.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on genomic data and does not explore other data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using Genomator on financial or biomedical datasets, measuring accuracy, privacy, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of ultra-rare variants on the accuracy and privacy of synthetic genomes generated by Genomator?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that ultra-rare variants are attenuated in Genomator's output, but does not quantify the impact on accuracy or privacy.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide data on how ultra-rare variants affect the quality of synthetic genomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of synthetic genomes with varying frequencies of ultra-rare variants, measuring changes in accuracy and privacy metrics.

## Limitations
- Privacy guarantees assume attacker has complete knowledge of original dataset, which may not reflect real-world threat models
- Computational efficiency gains are primarily demonstrated for diploid genomes; performance for polyploid or more complex genomic structures remains unverified
- SAT-based approach may not account for higher-order combinatorial patterns that could enable re-identification

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The SAT-based constraint generation mechanism and its ability to preserve LD structure (accuracy claims) - supported by clear algorithmic description and multiple validation methods
- **Medium Confidence**: Privacy guarantees through deductive exposure analysis - while the methodology is sound, real-world applicability depends on attacker capabilities not fully characterized
- **Medium Confidence**: Computational efficiency claims (1000-1600x faster) - demonstrated but dependent on specific hardware and SAT solver implementations

## Next Checks

1. Test Genomator's privacy guarantees against a membership inference attack that uses machine learning rather than pure logic, to assess real-world vulnerability
2. Evaluate performance and accuracy when scaling to polyploid genomes or incorporating structural variants beyond SNPs
3. Benchmark against emerging synthetic data methods (e.g., transformers, diffusion models) on the same genomic datasets to verify relative efficiency claims
