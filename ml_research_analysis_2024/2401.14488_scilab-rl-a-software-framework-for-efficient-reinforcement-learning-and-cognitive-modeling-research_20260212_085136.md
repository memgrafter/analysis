# Scilab-RL: A software framework for efficient reinforcement learning and cognitive modeling research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.14488
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14488
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Framework reduces researcher setup time and enables visualization for RL experiments

## Executive Summary
Scilab-RL is a software framework designed to streamline reinforcement learning and cognitive modeling research for robotic agents. The framework addresses the common problem of researchers spending excessive time setting up computational frameworks by providing an integrated suite of tools including Stable Baselines 3 algorithms, OpenAI Gym interface, visualization capabilities, and hyperparameter optimization. It is particularly aimed at new researchers and interdisciplinary scientists who may not be native programmers, offering a command-line interface with YAML configuration to lower the barrier to entry in RL research.

## Method Summary
Scilab-RL integrates multiple RL research tools into a cohesive framework, focusing on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning using Stable Baselines 3 implementations and the OpenAI Gym interface. The framework enables native experiment visualizations through tools like MLFlow and Weights & Biases, and incorporates hyperparameter optimization via Optuna. Researchers configure algorithms and environments through YAML files and run experiments using a main.py script. The framework supports robotic simulators such as MuJoCo and CoppeliaSim, and emphasizes online visualization of metrics like Q-values during training to help researchers verify hypotheses about reward shaping and intrinsic rewards.

## Key Results
- Reduces researcher time by providing pre-integrated suite of RL tools
- Enables novel intrinsic reward formulations through online visualization
- Democratizes RL research by lowering barrier to entry for non-native programmers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reduces researcher time by providing a pre-integrated suite of RL tools. Combines Stable Baselines 3 algorithms, OpenAI Gym interface, visualization, and hyperparameter optimization in a single framework. Assumes researchers would otherwise spend significant time integrating these components manually. Weak evidence; no corpus papers directly address RL framework integration efficiency. Break condition: If researchers prefer highly specialized, non-integrated tools or have existing workflows that already provide these capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
Improves learning performance by enabling novel intrinsic reward formulations. Provides online visualization of Q-values and other metrics during environment rendering, allowing researchers to verify hypotheses about reward shaping. Assumes visual feedback of agent behavior metrics helps researchers debug and refine reward functions. No direct corpus evidence; this appears to be a novel contribution of the framework. Break condition: If the visualization features are not used or if researchers prefer offline analysis methods.

### Mechanism 3
Democratizes RL research by lowering the barrier to entry for non-native programmers. Provides a command-line interface with YAML configuration files, reducing the need for extensive Python programming knowledge. Assumes many researchers in cognitive modeling and psychology have limited programming experience but can benefit from RL techniques. No corpus evidence directly addressing this claim. Break condition: If the target researchers are already proficient programmers or if the framework's abstractions prove too limiting for their needs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The framework focuses on methods that avoid reward-shaping by using goal-conditioned RL and hindsight experience replay.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between reward-shaping and goal-conditioned RL?

- Concept: Stable Baselines 3 integration
  - Why needed here: The framework leverages Stable Baselines 3 algorithms, so understanding how to use and modify these algorithms is essential.
  - Quick check question: How would you modify a Stable Baselines 3 algorithm to add a custom intrinsic reward?

- Concept: OpenAI Gym interface
  - Why needed here: The framework uses the OpenAI Gym interface for environment interactions, which is the standard interface for RL environments.
  - Quick check question: What are the core methods that an OpenAI Gym environment must implement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Python framework using YAML configuration -> Stable Baselines 3 algorithms -> OpenAI Gym interface with MuJoCo and CoppeliaSim simulators -> Visualization (MLFlow, Weights & Biases, online metric rendering) -> Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization via Hydra -> Performance and smoke tests for CI/CD

- Critical path: 1. Configure algorithm and environment in YAML files 2. Run main.py with specified algorithm and environment 3. Visualize results using integrated tools or external platforms 4. Iterate by modifying algorithms or hyperparameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pros: Integration of multiple tools reduces setup time; online visualization provides immediate feedback
  - Cons: Dependency on specific RL libraries (Stable Baselines 3) may limit algorithm choices; online visualization may impact performance

- Failure signatures: Configuration errors in YAML files; compatibility issues between Stable Baselines 3 versions and custom algorithms; simulator installation problems (MuJoCo, CoppeliaSim); visualization tools failing to connect to external platforms

- First 3 experiments: 1. Run a basic SAC algorithm on FetchPush-v1 to verify framework functionality 2. Modify SAC to add custom intrinsic reward and visualize Q-value variance 3. Perform hyperparameter optimization on the modified SAC algorithm using Optuna

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective is Scilab-RL at reducing setup time and accelerating research in cognitive modeling and RL compared to other existing frameworks? The paper claims that Scilab-RL minimizes setup effort and coding overhead, but does not provide quantitative comparisons with other frameworks. No empirical data or user studies are provided to validate the claimed efficiency gains. Benchmarking studies comparing Scilab-RL to other frameworks in terms of time to setup, code development speed, and research output would be needed.

### Open Question 2
How well does the online visualization feature in Scilab-RL scale to more complex environments and RL algorithms beyond the simple FetchPush example? The paper describes the online visualization feature but only demonstrates it on a simple FetchPush environment. It is unclear how well it would work for more complex scenarios. Case studies applying the online visualization to a variety of complex environments and RL algorithms would be needed.

### Open Question 3
How does the hyperparameter optimization in Scilab-RL compare to other state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods in terms of finding optimal hyperparameters and search efficiency? The paper describes the hyperparameter optimization feature but does not compare its performance to other methods. Empirical comparisons of Scilab-RL's hyperparameter optimization against other state-of-the-art methods on a range of RL tasks would be needed.

## Limitations

- Primary uncertainty lies in the actual time savings claimed, as the paper provides no empirical data on researcher productivity improvements
- Framework's effectiveness depends heavily on adoption by the target audience of non-native programmers, for whom no adoption metrics are presented
- Claims about improved learning performance through visualization are largely anecdotal, with only one illustrative example provided

## Confidence

- Time-saving mechanism: Medium (Plausible but unverified with usage data)
- Learning performance improvement: Low (Single illustrative example insufficient for generalization)
- Democratization claims: Low (No evidence of actual adoption by target audience)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user study measuring actual time savings for researchers setting up RL experiments with and without Scilab-RL
2. Run ablation study comparing learning performance with and without the online visualization features across multiple algorithms and environments
3. Survey adoption rates among the intended audience (cognitive science, psychology researchers) to verify democratization claims
