# Learning from Unlabelled Data with Transformers: Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Aerial Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11299
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11299
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: NEOS achieves 32% improvement over SegFormer on aerial images and 21% improvement on street images using SPIE metric

## Executive Summary
This paper presents NEOS, a semantic segmentation method designed specifically for unlabelled aerial images using domain adaptation techniques. The approach leverages a Transformer-based architecture to address distribution inconsistencies between labelled and unlabelled datasets, enabling effective learning from unlabelled data. NEOS combines three distinct loss terms to optimize both classification accuracy and domain alignment, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing baseline models on aerial imagery tasks.

## Method Summary
NEOS employs a Transformer-based architecture with domain adaptation capabilities to perform semantic segmentation on unlabelled aerial images. The method integrates three complementary loss functions: cross-entropy for classification accuracy, Dice loss for segmentation quality, and a feature misalignment loss to handle domain shift between labelled and unlabelled data distributions. This multi-loss approach enables the model to learn robust semantic representations while simultaneously adapting to the characteristics of unlabelled aerial imagery, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in remote sensing applications.

## Key Results
- Achieves 32% improvement over SegFormer on aerial image segmentation tasks
- Demonstrates 21% improvement on street image segmentation using SPIE metric
- Shows effectiveness of domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of unlabelled aerial data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing domain shift through feature misalignment loss, which aligns feature distributions between labelled source data and unlabelled target aerial imagery. The combination of cross-entropy and Dice losses ensures both pixel-wise classification accuracy and overall segmentation quality. The Transformer architecture provides strong feature extraction capabilities that are particularly suited for handling the complex patterns and spatial relationships present in aerial imagery.

## Foundational Learning

**Domain Adaptation**: Transfer learning technique for adapting models trained on one domain to perform well on a different but related domain. Why needed: Aerial imagery has different characteristics than typical street-level imagery used in segmentation benchmarks. Quick check: Verify feature distributions between source and target domains before and after adaptation.

**Dice Loss**: Similarity measure used in segmentation to evaluate overlap between predicted and ground truth masks. Why needed: Provides complementary information to cross-entropy by focusing on region overlap rather than pixel-wise accuracy. Quick check: Calculate Dice coefficient independently to verify segmentation quality.

**Feature Misalignment Loss**: Loss function designed to minimize distribution differences between source and target domain features. Why needed: Critical for handling domain shift when working with unlabelled target data. Quick check: Visualize feature space distributions using t-SNE or similar dimensionality reduction.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Images -> Feature Extractor (Transformer) -> Segmentation Head -> Three Loss Functions (Cross-entropy, Dice, Feature Misalignment) -> Optimized Model

Critical Path: The model processes input images through the Transformer backbone to extract features, which are then passed to the segmentation head for pixel-wise classification. During training, all three loss functions are computed simultaneously and their gradients are backpropagated through the network to update weights.

Design Tradeoffs: The multi-loss approach balances classification accuracy with segmentation quality and domain alignment, but increases computational complexity. The choice of Dice loss complements cross-entropy but requires careful weighting. Feature misalignment loss adds domain adaptation capability but may introduce additional optimization challenges.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on aerial imagery despite good street-level results indicates domain adaptation failure. Overfitting to source domain features while ignoring target domain characteristics suggests insufficient feature misalignment. Disjoint performance between cross-entropy and Dice loss metrics may indicate optimization imbalance.

First Experiments:
1. Test model performance on labelled validation set to establish baseline segmentation quality
2. Evaluate domain adaptation effectiveness by comparing feature distributions before and after training
3. Conduct ablation study removing each loss component to quantify individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in available information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single unlabelled dataset (CVUSA aerial dataset)
- Performance claims lack specificity regarding baseline models used for comparison
- No cross-dataset validation to verify generalizability across different aerial imaging conditions

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Performance improvements over SegFormer | Low |
| Effectiveness of domain adaptation approach | Medium |
| Generalizability to other aerial datasets | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each loss component (cross-entropy, Dice loss, feature misalignment loss) to performance gains
2. Test NEOS on multiple unlabelled aerial datasets beyond CVUSA to verify generalization across different aerial imaging conditions
3. Compare against a broader range of established domain adaptation methods (e.g., CyCADA, AdaptSegNet) to establish relative performance in the aerial segmentation domain
