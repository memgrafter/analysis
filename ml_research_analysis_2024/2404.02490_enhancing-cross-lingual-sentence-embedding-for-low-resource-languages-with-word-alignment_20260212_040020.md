# Enhancing Cross-lingual Sentence Embedding for Low-resource Languages with Word Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.02490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02490
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Proposed WACSE framework improves low-resource cross-lingual sentence embeddings by 3.6-8.5% on bitext retrieval while maintaining competitive high-resource performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the poor cross-lingual sentence embedding alignment for low-resource languages by proposing the WACSE framework, which explicitly aligns words between English and eight low-resource languages using word alignment models. The framework incorporates three training objectives: aligned word prediction, word translation ranking, and translation ranking. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in low-resource languages while maintaining competitive performance across high-resource tasks, showing the effectiveness and practicality of the approach.

## Method Summary
WACSE uses XLM-R as a shared encoder and incorporates three training objectives: Translation Ranking (TR) for sentence-level alignment, Aligned Word Prediction (AWP) for masked word prediction using word alignment supervision, and Word Translation Ranking (WTR) for token-level contrastive learning. The framework uses WSPAlign to provide word pair supervision with a threshold of 0.9. Training involves 10K steps with AdamW optimizer, batch size 1024, and gradient accumulation. The final loss is a weighted sum of the three objectives (α=0.8, β=0.1, γ=0.1).

## Key Results
- Bitext retrieval accuracy improves by 3.6-8.5% for low-resource languages compared to baselines
- Maintains competitive performance on high-resource tasks (STS22, XNLI, BUCC)
- Ablation studies show both AWP and WTR contribute to performance gains over TR-only baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Word alignment supervision directly addresses under-alignment of low-resource word embeddings
- Mechanism: WSPAlign provides semantically equivalent word pairs that enable precise token-level mappings between languages
- Core assumption: WSPAlign outputs sufficiently accurate supervision signals for low-resource pairs
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions under-alignment issue; section describes word pair prediction task; corpus shows no direct evidence for WSPAlign accuracy
- Break condition: If WSPAlign accuracy drops below critical threshold, supervision signal degrades

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Token-level contrastive learning (WTR) improves cross-lingual alignment beyond sentence-level supervision
- Mechanism: WTR uses cosine similarity between contextualized token representations in parallel sentences
- Core assumption: Contextual embeddings retain semantic consistency for parallel tokens
- Evidence anchors: Section describes WTR task; abstract mentions translation ranking; corpus lacks direct evidence for low-resource WTR effectiveness
- Break condition: If token embeddings collapse under contrastive pressure, method fails to preserve language-specific semantics

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combined multi-task objective yields better low-resource performance than any single objective
- Mechanism: TR ensures sentence-level alignment, AWP reinforces word prediction, WTR adds token-level contrastive alignment
- Core assumption: Weighted sum preserves balance without overwhelming any single signal
- Evidence anchors: Section describes weighted loss calculation; abstract mentions substantial improvements; ablation shows both AWP and WTR contribute
- Break condition: If one objective dominates during training, it may suppress complementary benefits of others

## Foundational Learning

- **Cross-lingual word alignment**: Provides supervision signal that grounds token-level objectives in WACSE. Quick check: What is the role of WSPAlign in WACSE's training pipeline?
- **Contrastive learning at token level**: Enables fine-grained semantic alignment between parallel tokens. Quick check: How does WTR differ from standard sentence-level contrastive learning?
- **Multilingual masked language modeling (MLM)**: AWP uses MLM-style masking to predict aligned words. Quick check: In AWP, what is masked and what is predicted?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input parallel sentences -> Encoder (XLM-R) -> Contextual embeddings -> WSPAlign supervision -> Compute TR, AWP, WTR losses -> Weighted aggregation -> Backpropagation
- **Critical path**: 1) Input parallel sentence pair → Encoder → Contextual embeddings 2) WSPAlign generates word pairs → AWP & WTR supervision 3) Compute TR, AWP, WTR losses → Aggregate → Backprop
- **Design tradeoffs**: Frozen WSPAlign avoids retraining but ties quality to external model; language embeddings help low-resource but may hurt high-resource generalization; multi-task weighting requires careful tuning
- **Failure signatures**: Low-resource languages plateau early (WSPAlign supervision too weak); high-resource performance drops (language ID embeddings over-regularize); training instability (loss weighting unbalanced)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train with TR only → Verify baseline low-resource gap 2) Add AWP only → Test word prediction benefit in isolation 3) Add WTR only → Test token contrastive benefit in isolation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do word-level alignment objectives affect cross-lingual sentence embeddings for languages with extremely limited parallel data (e.g., less than 10K sentence pairs)?
- What is the impact of using phrase-level alignment supervision instead of word-level alignment in the proposed framework?
- How does the proposed framework perform on downstream tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding beyond sentence similarity and bitext retrieval?

## Limitations
- No empirical validation of WSPAlign quality for low-resource languages; assumes 0.9 threshold provides sufficient supervision
- Loss weighting strategy lacks sensitivity analysis; current values may be locally optimal rather than globally optimal
- Token sequence handling implementation details unclear; could significantly affect performance

## Confidence
- **Low Confidence**: WACSE significantly improves low-resource sentence embeddings while maintaining competitive performance across high-resource tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: Token-level contrastive learning (WTR) provides complementary benefits beyond sentence-level supervision
- **Medium Confidence**: Combined multi-task objective yields better low-resource performance than any single objective

## Next Checks
1. **Alignment Quality Audit**: Measure WSPAlign precision and recall on manually annotated subset of low-resource parallel data; report F1 scores for each target language
2. **Loss Weight Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform grid search over α, β, γ values and report performance stability; identify whether current weights are robust
3. **Token Sequence Length Impact**: Implement and test truncation vs. padding approaches for different-length token sequences; report performance differences
