# Data Augmentation for Sparse Multidimensional Learning Performance Data Using Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15631
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework combining tensor factorization and Generative AI improves knowledge tracing performance on sparse adult literacy data

## Executive Summary
This study addresses data sparsity in learning performance data from Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which impacts accurate modeling of learner progress. The authors propose a systematic augmentation framework combining tensor factorization for data imputation and Generative AI models for data augmentation. Tensor factorization densifies sparse learner-question-attempt data, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT-4o) generate additional data based on identified learning performance patterns. Tested on an adult literacy dataset, the framework improved knowledge tracing performance compared to baseline methods and generated augmented data closely matching original distributions. Vanilla GAN showed greater stability, while GPT-4o demonstrated higher variability with occasional closer fidelity to original data. This approach enables cost-effective, controlled evaluation of ITS instructional designs before deployment.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in three stages: first, tensor factorization densifies sparse learner-question-attempt data by factorizing into latent learner features and knowledge components, then imputes missing values using sigmoid normalization and rank constraints; second, power-law functions are fitted to learner trajectories to extract initial ability (a) and learning rate (b) parameters, which are clustered using K-means++; third, generative AI models (Vanilla GAN and GPT-4o) generate synthetic data conditioned on these clusters. The approach is validated on an adult literacy dataset from AutoTutor with 252 participants across four lessons, achieving improved knowledge tracing performance compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Tensor factorization effectively densifies sparse learner-question-attempt data, improving knowledge tracing accuracy
- Vanilla GAN demonstrated greater stability in data generation compared to GPT-4o, which showed higher variability but occasional closer fidelity to original distributions
- Generated augmented data closely matched original distributions when measured using Earth Mover's Distance and distribution characteristic metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Tensor factorization effectively densifies sparse learning performance data by capturing latent learner-specific features and reconstructing missing values with high fidelity.
- Mechanism: The 3D tensor of learners × questions × attempts is factorized into low-rank components representing learner knowledge, question difficulty, and temporal attempts, plus bias terms. Missing values are estimated using sigmoid normalization and a rank-based constraint promoting monotonic knowledge growth.
- Core assumption: Learner interactions can be modeled as low-rank matrices with shared latent features, and missingness is structurally linked to the underlying learning process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing tasks"
  - [section IV-B] "tensor factorization into two lower dimensional components: (1) a factor matrix U of size U × K, which captures the latent learning-related features of U learners, such as initial learning abilities and learning rates, where K is the total number of these features; and (2) a latent tensor V of size K ×M ×N, representing learner knowledge in terms of K latent features across M attempts on N questions."
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct tensor factorization studies in corpus.
- Break condition: If the assumption of low-rank structure fails or if the latent dimension K is mis-specified, reconstruction error increases and predictive accuracy drops.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Generative AI models can produce scalable, diverse synthetic data that mirrors the distribution of original learner performance patterns.
- Mechanism: Vanilla GAN learns to generate realistic learner-attempt matrices by training a generator to fool a discriminator, while GPT-4o uses prompt-based encoding-decoding to simulate data matching statistical patterns of original clusters.
- Core assumption: The learned data distribution from original sparse data is representative enough to guide realistic synthetic generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT-4o) generate data based on identified learning performance patterns"
  - [section VI] "Vanilla GAN undergoes training over multiple epochs (N=3,000), alternating updates between the generator and discriminator... Ultimately, the finely tuned generator produces scalable augmented sample data."
  - [corpus] No corpus match on GAN for learning performance augmentation; mentions of GAN for image data and medical data augmentation but not educational sparse data.
- Break condition: If the learned distribution is biased or too sparse, generated data may diverge significantly from real learner behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Clustering learners by fitted power-law parameters (initial ability a, learning rate b) enables individualized augmentation that preserves learning trajectory characteristics.
- Mechanism: After tensor factorization densification, each learner's performance across attempts for a question is fit to Y=aX^b; these parameters are clustered using K-means++ to identify performance patterns; GenAI models then generate new data conditioned on cluster parameters.
- Core assumption: Power-law fitting accurately captures the shape of learning curves and differences in learner trajectories; clustering by these parameters yields meaningful groups for augmentation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This study contrasts two forms of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generate Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) to generate data associated with different clusters of learner data."
  - [section V] "We employed a power law function for G(·) to model the relationship between learners' performance values and their number of attempts... We then utilized K-means++ algorithm to cluster the distribution of these parameters ( a and b) among learners, which assists in identifying distinct individual learning performance patterns."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for power-law clustering in educational data augmentation.
- Break condition: If the power-law assumption is invalid for the data or if clusters are too heterogeneous, augmentation may fail to preserve key trajectory features.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data ingestion → 3D tensor construction (learners × questions × attempts) → Tensor factorization module (imputation, latent feature extraction) → Power-law fitting and K-means++ clustering (pattern identification) → GenAI module (Vanilla GAN, GPT-4o) → data augmentation → Evaluation pipeline (RMSE/MAE, EMD, IQR, BC metrics)

- Critical path:
  1. Build sparse tensor from raw learner logs.
  2. Run tensor factorization → densified tensor + latent features.
  3. Fit power-law curves → extract a, b parameters.
  4. Cluster by a, b → define learner groups.
  5. Apply GAN and GPT-4o to augment data per cluster.
  6. Evaluate augmented data vs original.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tensor factorization complexity vs accuracy: higher K captures more nuance but increases computation and overfitting risk.
  - GAN vs GPT-4o: GAN stable but may miss nuanced distributions; GPT-4o flexible but higher variability and prompt sensitivity.
  - Cluster granularity: too fine → sparse clusters hard to augment; too coarse → loss of individual pattern fidelity.

- Failure signatures:
  - Imputation errors high → tensor factorization parameters (λ, K, rank) likely mis-specified.
  - Generated data distribution diverges from original → clustering parameters or GenAI training insufficient.
  - EMD high across sample sizes → data augmentation not learning the distribution well.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run tensor factorization on a small lesson subset; inspect RMSE vs baseline models.
  2. Fit power-law curves to one question; verify a-b inverse relationship visually.
  3. Generate augmented data for a single cluster with Vanilla GAN at sample size 1,000; compute EMD to original.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do advanced GAN variants (DCGAN, cGAN, WGAN) compare to Vanilla GAN in terms of stability and data augmentation quality for learning performance data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while Vanilla GAN was used, "advanced GAN variants like Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Conditional GAN (cGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) could potentially enhance the augmentation process"
- Why unresolved: The study only tested Vanilla GAN and did not explore these advanced variants that could offer improved performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing all mentioned GAN variants on the same datasets with quantitative metrics like EMD, variance measures, and qualitative assessments of generated data quality

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of GPT o-1 compare to GPT-4o for learning performance data augmentation, particularly in handling complex patterns and reducing variability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "emerging advanced models, such as the GPT o-1, present promising avenues for further testing" but acknowledges this was beyond current scope due to limitations
- Why unresolved: The study was limited to GPT-4o and could not evaluate newer models that may offer improved capabilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of GPT-4o and GPT o-1 on identical augmentation tasks with statistical analysis of output distributions, divergence metrics, and fidelity to original data patterns

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Autoencoders (AE) improve data imputation for sparse learning performance data compared to tensor factorization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "Given the remarkable success of generative deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) [88], [89] and Autoencoders (AE) [90] for data imputation through reconstruction mechanism, future work should explore their potential"
- Why unresolved: The study used tensor factorization for imputation but did not test these alternative deep learning approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of GAIN, AE, and tensor factorization on identical sparse datasets measuring imputation accuracy, preservation of data structure, and computational efficiency

## Limitations
- Tensor factorization methodology lacks specific implementation details, including exact objective function formulations and rank-based constraint definitions
- Validation limited to a single dataset with 252 participants, raising questions about generalizability to other learning domains or larger populations
- Generative AI approaches show variable performance with GAN demonstrating stability while GPT-4o exhibits higher variability, but limited diagnostic analysis of why these differences occur

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core mechanism: tensor factorization effectively densifies sparse learner × question × attempt data by capturing latent features through low-rank matrix completion, as supported by established literature on tensor methods and the mathematical framework presented.

**Medium confidence** in the clustering approach: while power-law fitting provides a reasonable method for characterizing learning trajectories, the assumption that all learners follow power-law patterns may not hold universally across different subjects or learner populations.

**Low confidence** in the generative AI results: The study reports that GAN showed greater stability while GPT-4o demonstrated higher variability, but provides limited diagnostic analysis of why these differences occur or under what conditions each approach performs best.

## Next Checks

1. Test the tensor factorization module on a separate dataset with different sparsity patterns (e.g., medical education data) to assess generalizability and identify potential overfitting to the ARC dataset structure.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing power-law clustering against alternative clustering methods (e.g., k-means on raw performance metrics, hierarchical clustering) to determine whether the specific mathematical form is necessary for effective augmentation.

3. Perform systematic hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for both GAN and GPT-4o generators, varying latent dimensions, learning rates, and cluster sizes to identify optimal configurations and understand the source of the observed stability differences.
