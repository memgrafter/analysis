# Evaluation of Large Language Models for Summarization Tasks in the Medical Domain: A Narrative Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18170
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework for prompt engineering LLMs as evaluators for medical summarization tasks, combining zero-shot/in-context learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and human-aware loss functions

## Executive Summary
This narrative review addresses the critical challenge of evaluating large language models (LLMs) for medical summarization tasks, where traditional human evaluations are resource-intensive and automated metrics often fail to capture nuanced clinical content. The authors propose a novel framework that uses LLMs themselves as evaluators, leveraging zero-shot and in-context learning approaches combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and human-aware loss functions. This method aims to balance the efficiency of automated evaluation with the reliability of human assessment while addressing specific medical domain challenges like hallucinations, omissions, and factual accuracy.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a framework for using LLMs as evaluators for medical summarization tasks through prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning. The approach incorporates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and quantization to align the LLM with evaluation criteria, along with human-aware loss functions (HALO) derived from Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The method aims to create an "LLM-as-a-judge" that can assess clinical summaries with precision and accuracy comparable to human experts while maintaining the efficiency of automated evaluation systems.

## Key Results
- LLM-based evaluation frameworks can potentially combine the reliability of human evaluations with the efficiency of automated methods
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and HALO enable effective alignment of LLM evaluators with human preferences in clinical domains
- Automated LLM evaluation shows promise as an alternative to traditional methods for assessing clinical summary quality and accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLM-as-evaluator can replace human evaluation in high-stakes clinical summarization tasks without significant loss of accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM evaluator uses zero-shot and in-context learning to assess clinical summaries based on human evaluation rubrics, leveraging its understanding of medical concepts and reasoning to identify hallucinations, omissions, and factual errors.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM has been trained on sufficient medical domain knowledge and can generalize from few examples to perform evaluations comparable to human experts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The primary result is a framework for prompt engineering LLMs as evaluators, with a focus on balancing efficiency and reliability in medical domain evaluations."
  - [section 5] "An effective LLM evaluator would be able to respond to evaluative questions with precision and accuracy comparable to that of human experts, following frameworks like those used in human evaluation rubrics."
- **Break condition:** The LLM fails to identify subtle clinical reasoning errors or hallucinates its own medical facts during evaluation, or the evaluation rubrics don't capture all aspects of clinical summary quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with human-aware loss functions (HALO) enables effective alignment of LLM evaluators with human preferences in clinical domain.
- **Mechanism:** PEFT techniques like LoRA and quantization reduce the computational cost of fine-tuning while preserving model quality. HALO, derived from DPO and variants, optimizes the LLM directly on human preference data without needing a separate reward model, improving sample efficiency and alignment.
- **Core assumption:** Human preference data for clinical summaries is available and representative of the desired evaluation criteria.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.3] "DPO reformulates the alignment process into a human-aware loss function (HALO), optimized on a dataset of human preferences where prompts are paired with preferred and dis-preferred responses."
  - [section 5.4] "DPO, in contrast, directly optimizes model outputs based on human preferences without needing an explicit reward model, making it more sample-efficient and better aligned with human values."
- **Break condition:** Human preference data is insufficient, noisy, or doesn't capture the full complexity of clinical evaluation criteria, leading to misaligned evaluations.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Automated LLM-based evaluation is more scalable and consistent than human evaluation while maintaining reliability in clinical summarization tasks.
- **Mechanism:** LLMs can process summaries much faster than humans and provide consistent evaluations across different samples. The framework combines the efficiency of automated metrics with the nuanced assessment capabilities of human evaluators.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM evaluator is properly validated and tested for reliability and safety in the clinical domain.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "This method aims to leverage LLMs' capabilities to assess clinical summaries while addressing issues like hallucinations, omissions, and factual accuracy."
  - [section 6] "A well-designed LLM evaluator—an 'LLM-as-a-judge'—could potentially combine the high reliability of human evaluations with the efficiency of automated methods, while avoiding the pitfalls that have limited existing automated metrics."
- **Break condition:** The LLM evaluator introduces systematic biases, fails to maintain consistency across different evaluation criteria, or the validation process is insufficient to ensure reliability in clinical settings.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Medical domain knowledge and clinical reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The LLM evaluator needs to understand medical concepts, terminology, and clinical reasoning to accurately assess summaries of patient information and diagnoses.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between subjective and objective findings in a clinical note, and why both are important for diagnosis?

- **Concept: Prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning)**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on carefully designed prompts to guide the LLM evaluator in assessing clinical summaries based on human evaluation rubrics.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting, and when would you use each approach for LLM evaluation?

- **Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning and human alignment techniques**
  - Why needed here: PEFT techniques like LoRA and HALO are used to align the LLM evaluator with human preferences and clinical evaluation criteria without the computational cost of full fine-tuning.
  - Quick check question: How does Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) differ from Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) in terms of alignment process and computational requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  LLM evaluator model -> Prompt engineering module -> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning module -> Human alignment module -> Clinical evaluation rubric -> Validation and testing pipeline

- **Critical path:**
  1. Prepare clinical summary evaluation dataset with human annotations
  2. Design and test prompt engineering strategies for zero-shot and few-shot learning
  3. Apply PEFT with LoRA and quantization to align the LLM with evaluation criteria
  4. Fine-tune the LLM using HALO/DPO variants on human preference data
  5. Validate the LLM evaluator against human expert evaluations
  6. Deploy the LLM evaluator for automated assessment of clinical summaries

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Model size vs. computational efficiency: Larger models may provide better evaluation quality but are more expensive to fine-tune and deploy
  - Prompt complexity vs. generalizability: More complex prompts may improve evaluation accuracy but could reduce the LLM's ability to handle diverse summary types
  - Fine-tuning extent vs. preservation of base knowledge: Extensive fine-tuning may improve alignment but could lead to catastrophic forgetting of general medical knowledge
  - Human preference data quality vs. alignment effectiveness: High-quality preference data is crucial for effective alignment but can be expensive and time-consuming to collect

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Systematic bias in evaluations favoring certain summary styles or medical specialties
  - Inconsistent evaluation scores for similar summaries with minor variations
  - Failure to identify subtle clinical reasoning errors or hallucinations
  - Over-reliance on specific medical terminology or concepts at the expense of overall summary quality
  - Inability to handle diverse clinical note formats or patient populations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on a small set of clinical summaries with known evaluation outcomes to determine optimal prompt design.
  2. Apply LoRA-based PEFT to a pre-trained medical LLM and evaluate its performance on clinical summary assessment tasks, comparing against the base model and full fine-tuning approaches.
  3. Implement and test different HALO/DPO variants (e.g., DPO, KTO, SimPO) on a small human preference dataset to determine the most effective alignment strategy for clinical evaluation tasks.
