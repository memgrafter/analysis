# Investigating the Impact of Choice on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Space Controls

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12355
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Discrete actions improve fuel efficiency by enabling zero-thrust selection, with optimal discrete choice count depending on task requirements

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how discrete action spaces affect deep reinforcement learning performance for spacecraft inspection and docking tasks. The study compares continuous control against discrete action spaces with varying numbers of choices, finding that discrete actions reduce fuel usage by making "no thrust" a selectable option. For inspection tasks, three discrete actions with reduced magnitude provided optimal performance, while docking achieved best results with continuous control. The research demonstrates that there is no universal optimal balance between discrete and continuous actions, with task requirements determining the most effective approach.

## Method Summary
The study uses PPO-based deep reinforcement learning to compare continuous versus discrete action spaces for spacecraft relative motion control. Two tasks are examined: inspection (viewing 99 points on a sphere surface) and docking (approaching within 10m at low speed). The Clohessy-Wiltshire equations in Hill's frame model spacecraft dynamics. Continuous actions apply forces in range [-umax, umax], while discrete actions use evenly spaced values including zero. Experiments test umax values of 1.0N and 0.1N with 3-101 discrete action choices. Training uses 10 random seeds per configuration over 5 million timesteps, with evaluation every 500,000 timesteps on 10 test cases and final evaluation on 100 test cases. Metrics include total reward, success rate, fuel usage (ΔV), and task-specific measures.

## Key Results
- Discrete actions reduce fuel usage by making zero-thrust a selectable option
- Inspection task benefits from fewer discrete choices (3 actions) with reduced magnitude
- Docking task achieves best performance with continuous control
- Task operating range determines whether granularity or magnitude matters more

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Discrete action spaces improve fuel efficiency by making zero-thrust a selectable option
- Mechanism: With continuous control, exact zero is probabilistically unreachable; discrete actions explicitly include zero, enabling frequent selection of no-thrust states
- Core assumption: Fuel minimization is a primary objective and "no thrust" directly achieves this
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "discrete actions reduce fuel usage by making 'no thrust' a selectable option"
  - [section]: "it is very difficult for an agent to choose an exact value of zero for control... discrete actions allow an agent to easily choose zero"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers don't address this specific mechanism
- Break condition: Task requires constant small adjustments where zero-thrust selection becomes suboptimal

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Smaller action magnitude (lower umax) increases selection of near-zero actions in continuous control
- Mechanism: Reducing the action range increases probability of selecting values close to zero in continuous space, and also reduces maximum fuel expenditure per timestep
- Core assumption: Continuous agents can achieve similar efficiency gains by narrowing their action range
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "decreasing the action space magnitude... increases the likelihood of choosing 'no thrust'"
  - [section]: "By reducing the magnitude of the action space (i.e. decreasing umax) we increase the likelihood of choosing those 'near zero' actions"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence for this specific mechanism
- Break condition: Task requires large control inputs where small action magnitudes cannot achieve necessary movements

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Task operating range determines whether granularity or magnitude matters more
- Mechanism: Inspection task operates at larger distances allowing coarse adjustments, while docking requires fine-grained control near target
- Core assumption: Different tasks have inherently different precision requirements based on their operating envelopes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "inspection benefiting from fewer discrete choices and docking benefiting from continuous control"
  - [section]: "For inspection... smaller action magnitude is more important. For the docking task... finer granularity is more important"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers don't provide comparative evidence for this mechanism
- Break condition: Task characteristics change such that operating range requirements reverse

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning basics (policy, reward, value functions)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how agents learn to select actions based on reward maximization is fundamental to interpreting experimental results
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a policy and a value function in RL?

- Concept: Continuous vs discrete action spaces
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution compares these two action space types and their impact on performance
  - Quick check question: Why is it difficult to select exactly zero thrust with continuous control?

- Concept: Spacecraft relative motion dynamics (Clohessy-Wiltshire equations)
  - Why needed here: The experiments are conducted in Hill's frame using linearized orbital dynamics
  - Quick check question: What does the A matrix in the state-space equation represent in orbital mechanics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  OpenAI Gym-style environment wrapper with Hill's frame dynamics -> PPO-based RL algorithm supporting both continuous and discrete actions -> Reward function modules for inspection and docking tasks -> Evaluation pipeline with 10 random seeds and 10 test cases per policy

- Critical path:
  1. Environment step: action → state update → reward → observation
  2. PPO update: collect trajectory → compute advantage → update policy
  3. Evaluation: run deterministic policy on test cases → collect metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Discrete actions enable explicit zero-thrust but reduce control smoothness
  - Continuous actions provide smooth control but make zero-thrust selection improbable
  - Action magnitude affects both fuel efficiency and task completion capability

- Failure signatures:
  - High fuel usage with continuous actions → likely insufficient zero-thrust selection
  - Oscillatory trajectories with discrete actions → too few action choices causing over-correction
  - Low success rate with small umax → action magnitude insufficient for required maneuvers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Continuous control with umax=1.0N for both tasks
  2. Discrete comparison: 3 discrete actions with umax=0.1N for inspection
  3. Granularity test: 101 discrete actions with umax=0.1N for docking

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of discrete action spaces scale with higher dimensional control problems (e.g., six degrees of freedom spacecraft control)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only tests discrete actions in 3D translational control, but mentions future work exploring six degrees of freedom dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to 3D translation, so the effects of discretization on rotational control and combined 6DoF problems remain unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing continuous vs discrete actions across all six degrees of freedom, measuring fuel efficiency, task completion, and control smoothness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal method for defining discrete action sets when considering time-dependent thrust scheduling?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention exploring "time period for the thrust selection to better replicate a scheduled burn" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests static discrete action sets and doesn't investigate how time-varying thrust magnitudes affect performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing various time-dependent discrete action schemes against static discrete and continuous control baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice between discrete and continuous actions affect the generalization ability of trained policies to unseen environments or perturbations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper tests multiple random seeds and initial conditions, it doesn't examine policy robustness to environmental changes or disturbances.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation methodology focuses on fixed test cases within the same environment, not on policy transfer or robustness to perturbations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Transfer experiments testing trained policies on modified environments, added disturbances, or different spacecraft parameters, measuring success rate and fuel efficiency.

## Limitations

- Neural network architecture and PPO hyperparameters are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- The mechanism explaining why discrete actions improve fuel efficiency lacks theoretical analysis of why this specifically leads to better performance
- The explanation for task-specific performance differences relies on intuitive operational characteristics without systematic validation

## Confidence

- Medium: The core finding that discrete vs continuous actions affect fuel efficiency and task completion differently is well-supported by experimental evidence
- Medium: The mechanism explaining why discrete actions improve fuel efficiency through zero-thrust selection is plausible but not rigorously proven
- Low: The explanation for why inspection benefits from fewer discrete choices while docking benefits from continuous control relies on intuitive task characteristics without systematic validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies where agents are trained with explicit fuel penalties to determine if the zero-thrust selection advantage persists, isolating whether fuel efficiency drives the performance difference or if other factors are involved.

2. Test the discrete action space advantages across different PPO hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, network architectures) to determine if the observed benefits are robust to algorithmic variations.

3. Apply the same discrete vs continuous action space comparison to additional space control tasks (formation flying, proximity operations) to validate whether the inspection/docking task dichotomy generalizes to other operational scenarios.
