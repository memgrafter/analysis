# Use of Parallel Explanatory Models to Enhance Transparency of Neural Network Configurations for Cell Degradation Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11311
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11311
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Developed parallel explanatory model for RNNs that illuminates why adding layers leads to diminishing accuracy gains through spatial averaging and side lobe generation mechanisms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of understanding why accuracy gains diminish when adding layers to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for cell degradation detection in cellular networks. The authors develop a parallel explanatory model that views RNN processing from a probability density function perspective, showing how each layer transforms input distributions to increase detection accuracy while also discovering a side effect that limits accuracy improvement. By using linear approximations of the non-linear tanh function and Gaussian mixture models of input distributions, the model closely tracks RNN processing at each stage. Validation against RNN outputs demonstrates the model's fidelity in explaining the diminishing returns phenomenon and provides useful insights for future RNN and neural network designs.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a linearised model that operates in the probability density function domain to explain RNN behavior. The model uses Gaussian mixture approximations of input distributions and applies linear approximations to the non-linear tanh function. The approach involves spatial averaging to transform input features to hidden layers, temporal processing through linearized RNN operations, and tracking of main and side lobes in the output distributions. The model was validated against actual RNN outputs using simulated RSRP measurements from a cellular network, with faults applied at random points in sequences. Receiver Operating Curves were used to measure True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate across different RNN configurations.

## Key Results
- The model accurately tracks RNN processing at each stage, closely matching actual RNN outputs
- Spatial averaging reduces variance of input distributions through transformation to single Gaussian distributions per hidden layer channel
- Diminishing accuracy gains from adding layers are explained by increasing side lobes that contribute classification errors offsetting main lobe improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding hidden layers to an RNN reduces false positives and negatives by decreasing the variance of the input distributions through spatial averaging.
- Mechanism: Spatial averaging transforms a Gaussian mixture input into a single Gaussian distribution per hidden layer channel, reducing the overlap between normal and fault cases.
- Core assumption: The input RSRP values can be adequately represented as a Gaussian mixture model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This model is widely applicable in that it can be used with any input domain where the inputs can be represented by a Gaussian mixture."
  - [section]: "The spatial averaging stage applies matrix S to map the input features to the first hidden layer... the addition property for normal distributions [22] states that this will result in a single distribution."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus does not discuss spatial averaging or Gaussian mixture input representations.
- Break condition: If the input data cannot be adequately approximated by a Gaussian mixture, the spatial averaging mechanism will fail to reduce variance effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temporal processing in RNNs introduces unwanted "side lobes" in the output distributions that increase classification errors and offset accuracy gains from adding layers.
- Mechanism: The non-linear tanh function, when approximated linearly, causes the RNN to generate additional distributions (side lobes) beyond the main distributions, each contributing classification errors.
- Core assumption: The linear approximation of the tanh function is sufficient to capture the essential behavior of the RNN's temporal processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By looking at the RNN processing from a probability density function perspective, we are able to show how each layer of the RNN transforms the input distributions to increase detection accuracy. At the same time we also discover a side effect acting to limit the improvement in accuracy."
  - [section]: "We refer to the distributions due to the NNN and FFF cases as the main lobes and the intermediate distributions as the side lobes... The effect of the sidelobes, as we shall see, is the contribution of additional classification errors acting to reduce the improvements in main lobe accuracy."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus does not discuss side lobes or the impact of temporal processing on output distributions.
- Break condition: If the linear approximation of the tanh function is inadequate, the model will fail to accurately predict the emergence and impact of side lobes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The diminishing accuracy gains from adding layers or increasing RNN order are explained by the increasing number of side lobes, which contribute classification errors that offset the reductions in main lobe error rates.
- Mechanism: Each additional layer or increase in RNN order increases the number of side lobes, leading to more classification errors that counteract the benefits of reduced main lobe error rates.
- Core assumption: The relationship between the number of layers/increase in RNN order and the number of side lobes is consistent and predictable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We discovered, however, that this benefit comes with a negative effect namely the creation of side distributions, which act to limit the gain in overall accuracy."
  - [section]: "Each of these additional sidelobes acts as a source of further classification errors, so that the overall effect is to reduce the gain in accuracy which would otherwise be achieved by adding more layers."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus does not discuss the relationship between layers/RNN order and side lobe generation.
- Break condition: If the relationship between layers/RNN order and side lobe generation is not consistent or predictable, the model will fail to accurately explain the diminishing accuracy gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
  - Why needed here: The model relies on the assumption that input data can be represented as a Gaussian mixture, which is a foundational concept for understanding how the model processes and transforms input distributions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a Gaussian mixture model represents a complex distribution as a combination of simpler Gaussian distributions?

- Concept: Probability Density Functions (PDFs)
  - Why needed here: The model operates in the probability density function domain, viewing the RNN's operation as a transformation of input PDFs to increase detection accuracy. Understanding PDFs is crucial for grasping how the model tracks and predicts the RNN's internal processing.
  - Quick check question: How does a probability density function differ from a probability mass function, and why is this distinction important for continuous input data?

- Concept: Linear Approximations of Non-Linear Functions
  - Why needed here: The model uses linear approximations to represent the non-linear tanh function in the RNN, allowing for tractable mathematical analysis of the RNN's temporal processing. Understanding linear approximations is essential for comprehending how the model simplifies complex non-linear behavior.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between using a linear approximation versus the actual non-linear function, and how might these trade-offs impact the model's accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input GMM -> Spatial Averaging -> Temporal Processing -> Output Distribution
- Critical path: Input GMM → Spatial Averaging → Temporal Processing → Output Distribution
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model simplicity vs. accuracy: Using linear approximations simplifies the model but may reduce accuracy in capturing non-linear behavior.
  - Number of components in GMM: More components can better represent complex input distributions but increase computational complexity.
  - Length of sequence considered in temporal processing: Longer sequences provide more context but increase the number of side lobes and computational complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor fit between model-predicted and actual RNN outputs: Indicates inadequacy of linear approximations or GMM representation.
  - Unexpected increase in classification errors with added layers: Suggests unaccounted factors in side lobe generation or distribution overlap.
  - Model fails to converge or produces unstable results: May indicate issues with the linear approximation of the non-linear tanh function or numerical instability in calculations.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the model's ability to accurately predict RNN outputs for a simple first-order RNN with a known input distribution.
  2. Test the model's predictions for a multi-layer RNN, comparing the predicted and actual number of side lobes and their impact on classification accuracy.
  3. Investigate the effect of varying the number of components in the input GMM on the model's accuracy in predicting RNN behavior and classification outcomes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the linear approximation method perform when applied to more complex non-linear activation functions beyond tanh, such as ReLU or sigmoid, in RNNs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on linearizing the tanh function and mentions that the approach can be applied to other NN NLFs like logistic sigmoid, but does not explore ReLU or other common activation functions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the linear approximation approach for the tanh activation function. It is unclear whether the same linearization strategy would maintain accuracy and tractability when applied to different activation functions with different non-linear characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the linear approximation method using ReLU and sigmoid activation functions in RNNs, comparing the model's accuracy and performance against the original RNN outputs, and analyzing any differences in approximation errors or model fidelity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the linear model approach be extended to explain the behavior of more complex recurrent architectures like LSTMs and GRUs, which have additional gating mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests potential future work in extending the approach to LSTMs and GRUs, but does not explore this extension. The current model is designed for basic RNNs with simple feedback loops.
- Why unresolved: LSTMs and GRUs introduce additional complexity through gating mechanisms that control information flow, which are not present in the basic RNNs studied in this paper. It is unclear how the linear approximation method would handle these additional non-linear components and their interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating a linear model for LSTMs and GRUs, comparing the model's predictions against the actual RNN outputs, and analyzing the impact of gating mechanisms on the model's accuracy and interpretability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the number of Gaussian mixture components affect the accuracy of the linear model's predictions, and is there an optimal number for different types of input data distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that good results were achieved with GMMs containing four components, but does not explore the impact of varying the number of components on model accuracy or the potential for overfitting.
- Why unresolved: The choice of the number of GMM components is critical for balancing model accuracy and complexity. Using too few components may lead to poor approximation of the input distribution, while using too many could result in overfitting and reduced generalizability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying numbers of GMM components (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8) for different types of input data distributions, measuring the linear model's prediction accuracy and comparing it against the original RNN outputs, and analyzing the trade-off between model complexity and performance.

## Limitations
- The model relies on linear approximations of non-linear tanh functions, introducing uncertainty in capturing full RNN complexity
- The assumption that input data can be adequately represented as a Gaussian mixture may not hold for all real-world scenarios
- The model's generalizability to different input domains beyond RSRP measurements remains unproven

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The model's ability to track RNN processing through spatial averaging and its effectiveness in reducing variance through Gaussian mixture representation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The explanation of diminishing accuracy gains through side lobe generation and the linear approximation of tanh functions, pending further validation across diverse datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: The model's generalizability to other input domains and its ability to handle non-Gaussian distributions without significant performance degradation.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Apply the model to a different sequential data domain (e.g., natural language processing or time series forecasting) to assess its generalizability and identify any domain-specific limitations.
2. **Non-Gaussian Input Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance when applied to input data that cannot be adequately represented by a Gaussian mixture, measuring the impact on accuracy predictions and side lobe generation.
3. **Alternative Non-Linear Function Comparison**: Compare the model's predictions using linear approximations of different non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) to determine the sensitivity of the model to the choice of activation function and approximation method.
