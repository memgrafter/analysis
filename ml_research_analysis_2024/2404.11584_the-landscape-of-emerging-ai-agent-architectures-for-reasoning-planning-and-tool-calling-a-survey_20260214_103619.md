## Executive Summary
This survey examines recent AI agent architectures focused on reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities. The paper categorizes agents as single-agent (one LLM handling all tasks) or multi-agent (multiple LLMs collaborating), with multi-agent further divided into vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (equal peer) structures. Key findings include: single agents work well for well-defined tasks with clear tool sets, while multi-agent systems excel at complex problems requiring collaboration and parallelization. Effective agent systems incorporate elements like clear leadership, dedicated planning phases, dynamic team structures, human feedback, and intelligent message filtering. The paper highlights challenges including benchmark evaluation inconsistencies, real-world applicability limitations, and bias concerns in agent systems.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comparative analysis of AI agent architectures for reasoning, planning, and tool calling by examining 40 cited research papers on AI agent implementations. The study evaluates effectiveness on complex goals requiring reasoning, planning, and tool execution across different architectural approaches, synthesizing findings from various agent implementations to identify patterns and best practices in the field.

## Key Results
- Single-agent architectures excel for tasks with clear tool sets and well-defined processes
- Multi-agent architectures improve performance through dynamic team structures and clear leadership
- Feedback loops (human or agentic) significantly improve agent accuracy and reduce hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Single-agent architectures excel when tasks have clear tool sets and well-defined processes.
- Mechanism: The single agent can focus reasoning and tool execution without the complexity of coordinating with other agents, reducing decision overhead and potential for miscommunication.
- Core assumption: Task requirements are stable and predictable enough that one agent can manage all steps effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We find that single agent architectures are especially useful when the task requires straightforward function calling and does not need feedback from another agent [22]."
  - [abstract] "single agents work well for well-defined tasks with clear tool sets"
- Break condition: Task complexity increases beyond the single agent's ability to maintain context and execute multiple interdependent steps reliably.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-agent architectures improve performance through dynamic team structures and clear leadership.
- Mechanism: Agents with specialized roles can divide labor, reducing individual cognitive load and enabling parallel execution. Leadership provides coordination and prevents redundant communication.
- Core assumption: Task decomposition into subtasks aligns with agent capabilities and communication overhead remains manageable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Their results demonstrate that agent teams with an organized leader complete their tasks nearly 10% faster than teams without a leader."
  - [section] "dynamic team structures with rotating leadership provide the best results, with both the lowest time to task completion and the lowest communication cost on average."
- Break condition: Communication overhead exceeds the benefits of parallelization, or leadership structure creates bottlenecks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Feedback loops (human or agentic) significantly improve agent accuracy and reduce hallucination.
- Mechanism: Iterative refinement allows agents to correct course based on new information, preventing compounding errors from early incorrect assumptions.
- Core assumption: Feedback is timely, relevant, and actionable within the agent's reasoning framework.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "By implementing feedback, agents are much more likely to correct their course and reach their goal."
  - [section] "the inclusion of human oversight improves the immediate outcome by aligning the agent's responses more closely with human expectations"
- Break condition: Feedback becomes inconsistent, contradictory, or introduces new biases that compound rather than correct errors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reasoning and Planning in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Agents must break down complex goals into executable steps and adapt plans based on feedback.
  - Quick check question: What are the five major approaches to planning mentioned in the paper?

- Concept: Tool Calling and External API Integration
  - Why needed here: Agents interact with external systems through tool functions, requiring understanding of API contracts and error handling.
  - Quick check question: How does the RAISE method enhance tool calling compared to ReAct?

- Concept: Multi-Agent Communication Patterns
  - Why needed here: Different architectures (vertical vs horizontal) require different communication strategies to avoid information overload and ensure coordination.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between vertical and horizontal multi-agent architectures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Brain (LLM reasoning) -> Perception (input processing) -> Action (tool execution) -> Memory (short and long-term) -> Communication layer (for multi-agent) -> Planning module -> Evaluation module
- Critical path: Receive task → Plan (decompose and strategize) → Execute (call tools, reason iteratively) → Evaluate (self-reflection or external feedback) → Refine plan if needed
- Design tradeoffs: Single vs multi-agent (simplicity vs parallelization), fixed vs dynamic teams (stability vs adaptability), human vs agent feedback (reliability vs autonomy), structured vs unstructured communication (clarity vs flexibility)
- Failure signatures: Endless loops in single agents, communication overhead in multi-agent systems, hallucination due to insufficient role definition, performance degradation with increased task complexity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a single agent using ReAct pattern on a well-defined task with 3-5 tool calls to validate planning and execution loop
  2. Add human feedback mechanism to the single agent to test improvement in accuracy and task completion rate
  3. Convert to a two-agent vertical architecture for the same task to measure performance differences and identify coordination overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark tasks often fail to capture real-world complexity and use artificially constructed scenarios
- Inconsistent evaluation metrics across studies make direct comparisons unreliable
- Limited empirical evidence on how architectural choices affect bias propagation or mitigation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Single-agent effectiveness for well-defined tasks with clear tool sets (supported by multiple cited studies)
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-agent benefits from dynamic team structures and leadership (supported by some empirical results but limited by benchmark quality)
- **Medium Confidence**: Feedback loop importance for reducing hallucination (well-supported theoretically but limited real-world validation)
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about specific performance improvements (10% faster completion) due to inconsistent evaluation methodologies across studies

## Next Checks
1. Implement controlled experiments comparing single-agent vs multi-agent architectures on identical real-world tasks to validate claimed performance differences
2. Conduct systematic analysis of communication overhead in multi-agent systems across different team structures and task complexities
3. Design benchmark evaluation framework that incorporates practical deployment metrics (cost, latency, reliability) alongside traditional accuracy measures
