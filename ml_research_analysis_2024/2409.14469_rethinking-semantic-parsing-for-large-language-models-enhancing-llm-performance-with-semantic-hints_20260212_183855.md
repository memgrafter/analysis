# Rethinking Semantic Parsing for Large Language Models: Enhancing LLM Performance with Semantic Hints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.14469
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14469
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: SENSE improves LLM performance by embedding semantic hints rather than explicit parsing results, outperforming vanilla prompting and CoT approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the assumption that semantic parsing universally benefits LLMs by demonstrating that direct incorporation of semantic parsing results actually harms LLM performance, unlike with smaller models like BERT. The authors propose SENSE, a novel prompting approach that embeds semantic hints within prompts to encourage LLMs to leverage their internal semantic parsing capabilities. Through comprehensive experiments across GLUE benchmark understanding tasks and generation tasks including paraphrasing, simplification, and machine translation, SENSE consistently improves LLM performance, with GPT-4o-mini showing a 1.82% accuracy increase on GLUE tasks and enhanced linguistic quality in generation outputs.

## Method Summary
The SENSE approach introduces semantic hints like "utilize semantic parsing result to enhance comprehension of sentence's structure and semantics" within prompts, avoiding explicit symbolic parsing results that degrade LLM performance. The method compares SENSE against vanilla prompts, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and direct semantic parsing integration (SP-Input/SP-Output) across multiple tasks and models including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and LLaMA3-70B. Experiments use zero-shot prompting with temperature 0 and top_p 1, evaluating understanding tasks via accuracy/MCC and generation tasks via BLEU, SARI, SAMSA, and linguistic metrics for semantic similarity and syntactic diversity.

## Key Results
- SENSE improves GPT-4o-mini GLUE accuracy from 79.43% to 81.25% while direct semantic parsing reduces performance
- SENSE enhances paraphrasing quality by increasing syntactic diversity while maintaining semantic similarity
- SENSE outperforms Chain-of-Thought prompting across all tested tasks and models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Semantic hints improve LLM performance by leveraging the model's internal semantic parsing capabilities without explicit parsing results.
- **Mechanism**: The SENSE approach adds simple semantic hints like "utilize semantic parsing result to enhance comprehension of sentence's structure and semantics" within the prompt. This encourages LLMs to engage their internal understanding of linguistic structures, leading to better performance across tasks.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs possess inherent semantic parsing capabilities that can be activated through semantic hints, even without explicit parsing results.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "SENSE introduces simple semantic hints such as 'utilize semantic parsing result' to 'fully understand input' or 'capture grammatical structures and semantics' to complete downstream tasks."
  - [section] "Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SENSE promote LLM to focus more on key semantic information, not only achieves superior and consistent performance across various tasks, but also produces more linguistically aligned results, particularly on simplification and paraphrasing tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work on semantic parsing but lacks direct evidence about internal parsing capabilities.
- **Break condition**: If LLMs lack sufficient internal semantic parsing capabilities or if semantic hints introduce confusion rather than clarity.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Semantic hints reduce reliance on explicit symbolic representations that harm LLM performance.
- **Mechanism**: By avoiding direct incorporation of semantic parsing results (which contain unfamiliar symbols and schemes), SENSE prevents the degradation in performance observed when explicit parsing results are added to LLMs.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs struggle with processing the schemes and symbols of explicit semantic parsing results, and this struggle can be avoided by using semantic hints instead.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Our empirical findings reveal that, unlike smaller models, directly adding semantic parsing results into LLMs reduces their performance."
  - [section] "Previous studies, such as those by Ettinger et al. (2023) and Jin et al. (2024), highlight the difficulty LLMs face in processing the schemes and symbols of explicit semantic parsing results."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work but lacks direct evidence about symbolic representation issues.
- **Break condition**: If semantic hints themselves become too complex or symbolic, reintroducing the same processing difficulties.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Semantic hints improve attention distribution, leading to better semantic alignment in outputs.
- **Mechanism**: The attention visualization shows that SENSE prompts place greater emphasis on key semantic elements compared to vanilla prompts, resulting in outputs that are more linguistically aligned and diverse.
- **Core assumption**: Improved attention to semantic elements directly translates to better task performance and output quality.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "SENSE encourages LLMs to leverage their internal semantic parsing capabilities through the addition of semantic hints."
  - [section] "The visualization reveals that, compared to vanilla prompt, SENSE places greater emphasis on key semantic elements, such as important lexical units and core components."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work but lacks direct evidence about attention mechanisms.
- **Break condition**: If attention improvements don't translate to measurable performance gains or if they lead to overfitting on specific semantic patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Semantic parsing fundamentals (SRL, FSP, AMR)
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding the different types of semantic parsing helps explain why SENSE works - it leverages semantic information without requiring specific parsing formats.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the three main types of semantic parsing mentioned in the paper, and how do they differ in their approach to capturing meaning?

- **Concept**: Prompt engineering and zero-shot learning
  - **Why needed here**: SENSE operates in a zero-shot manner by adding semantic hints to prompts, making understanding prompt engineering principles essential.
  - **Quick check question**: How does zero-shot prompting differ from few-shot prompting, and why is this distinction important for SENSE's approach?

- **Concept**: Attention mechanisms in transformer models
  - **Why needed here**: The paper's attention visualization analysis requires understanding how attention works in transformers to interpret the results.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the attention mechanism in transformer models help explain why SENSE improves semantic alignment in outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input text + semantic hints → LLM internal semantic parsing → Improved attention distribution → Better semantic alignment → Enhanced task performance → Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path**: Semantic hints → LLM internal processing → Improved attention distribution → Better semantic alignment → Enhanced task performance
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Simplicity vs. specificity: Simple semantic hints work broadly but may miss task-specific nuances
  - General vs. task-specific hints: General hints work across tasks but may be less effective than tailored hints
  - Prompt length vs. effectiveness: Longer hints may provide more guidance but risk overwhelming the model
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Performance degradation when hints become too complex or symbolic
  - Overfitting to specific semantic patterns when hints are too narrow
  - Confusion or contradictory outputs when hints conflict with task instructions
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Test SENSE against vanilla prompting on GLUE benchmark tasks to verify performance improvements
  2. **Hint variation**: Test different semantic hint formulations (e.g., "utilize semantic parsing" vs. "focus on grammatical structures") to find optimal hint design
  3. **Cross-task generalization**: Apply SENSE to tasks not covered in the paper (e.g., text classification, named entity recognition) to test broader applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SENSE perform across different LLM architectures beyond LLaMA and GPT-series models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that SENSE was validated on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and LLaMA3-70B, but acknowledges the need to extend testing to other architectures.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to a few specific models, leaving uncertainty about SENSE's general applicability to other LLM architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing SENSE across a broader range of LLM architectures (e.g., Claude, PaLM, Mistral) and comparing performance metrics would clarify its generalizability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the underlying mechanism by which semantic parsing influences LLM decision-making?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that LLMs function as black-box systems and the mechanism of how semantic parsing influences their decision-making remains unclear.
- Why unresolved: LLMs' internal workings are not transparent, making it difficult to understand how semantic hints alter their processing and outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of LLM attention patterns, internal representations, and decision processes when using SENSE versus vanilla prompts could elucidate the mechanism.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does SENSE improve performance on a wider variety of NLP tasks beyond those tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on GLUE, paraphrasing, simplification, and machine translation tasks, but suggests broader testing is needed.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to tasks where semantic parsing benefits are established, but its potential across diverse applications is unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating SENSE on a wider range of NLP tasks (e.g., summarization, dialogue generation, code generation) and datasets would assess its broader applicability.

## Limitations
- The mechanism by which semantic hints activate internal semantic parsing capabilities lacks direct experimental validation
- The semantic hints used are relatively simple, raising questions about whether more sophisticated formulations could yield additional improvements
- The scope of tasks tested, while diverse, may not cover all potential edge cases where semantic hints could introduce confusion

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical finding that direct incorporation of semantic parsing results degrades LLM performance is well-supported by the comparative experiments. The performance improvements from SENSE across multiple benchmarks and metrics are consistently demonstrated.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that SENSE works by encouraging LLMs to leverage internal semantic parsing capabilities is plausible given the results but lacks direct mechanistic evidence. The explanation that semantic hints avoid symbolic representation issues is supported by the failure of direct parsing integration but remains largely theoretical.

**Low Confidence**: The specific attention distribution improvements and their direct causal relationship to output quality remain uncertain. While visualizations show attention differences, the connection to task performance requires further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Semantic Hint Components**: Systematically test which elements of semantic hints (e.g., "utilize semantic parsing," "understand structure," "capture semantics") are essential for performance improvements. Remove individual components to identify the minimum effective hint formulation and test whether certain phrases are more critical than others.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply SENSE to tasks outside the paper's scope, such as text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering on specialized domains (medical, legal, technical). This would validate whether the semantic hint approach generalizes beyond the tested benchmarks and generation tasks.

3. **Internal Representation Analysis**: Use probing techniques or attention head analysis to directly examine whether LLMs show evidence of semantic parsing activation when semantic hints are present. Compare internal representations between vanilla, CoT, and SENSE prompts to identify specific neural signatures of semantic parsing engagement.
