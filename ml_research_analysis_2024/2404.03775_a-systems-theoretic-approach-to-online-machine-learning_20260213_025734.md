# A Systems Theoretic Approach to Online Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.03775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03775
- Authors: Anli du Preez; Peter A. Beling; Tyler Cody
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Presents a systems theoretic framework for online learning using Abstract Learning Systems Theory, addressing concept drift and enabling top-down design.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel systems theoretic framework for online learning (OL) that addresses the lack of formal theoretical models for OL systems and the challenge of concept drift. The authors formalize OL using Abstract Learning Systems Theory, providing a definition of OL systems and identifying key design parameters through decomposition into system structure and behavior. The framework focuses on relationships between learning systems at successive time steps and probability measures on predictive functions. Applied to healthcare provider fraud detection as a case study, the work demonstrates practical relevance while offering a new perspective that facilitates development of more robust and reliable OL systems.

## Method Summary
The method involves formalizing online learning systems using Abstract Learning Systems Theory by decomposing OL into system structure (input/output spaces) and system behavior (probability measures). The framework treats OL as a sequence of transfer learning problems, mapping system structures between time steps through homomorphic mappings while handling concept drift as non-stationarity in input distributions or posterior probabilities. The approach separates concerns between structural changes and behavioral drift, enabling modular design and targeted updates through a knowledge base that stores historical data, mappings, and model snapshots.

## Key Results
- Provides a formalized definition of online learning systems using Abstract Learning Systems Theory
- Identifies system structure and behavior characteristics through decomposition into input-output spaces and probability measures
- Offers a systems theoretic approach to concept drift, treating it as non-stationarity in distributions
- Demonstrates practical application through healthcare provider fraud detection case study

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework treats online learning as a sequence of transfer learning problems, allowing reuse of structural mappings across time steps.
- Mechanism: At each time step t, the system structure S_t is mapped onto S_{t+1} via homomorphic mappings ρ: X_t → X_{t+1} and ϑ: Y_t → Y_{t+1}. This reduces the problem to repeated knowledge transfer.
- Core assumption: The structural relationship between consecutive systems can be captured by a finite set of mappings, and these mappings remain valid long enough to be reused.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "the systems theoretic formulation presented herein serves to provide a framework for the top-down design of online learning systems"; [section IV] "Creating or assuming homogeneous system structures may be impractical... The concept of homomorphism can be used to address these challenges"
- Break condition: If the data distribution changes too rapidly or in a way that invalidates the homomorphism (e.g., emergence of entirely new feature spaces), the mapping becomes useless.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Concept drift is formalized as non-stationarity in either the input distribution P(X), the posterior P(Y|X), or both, and handled through structural and behavioral updates.
- Mechanism: Virtual drift is addressed by detecting changes in P(X) and updating the feature representation; real drift is addressed by retraining or adjusting the predictive function f to match new P(Y|X).
- Core assumption: Drift detection methods can accurately localize and classify the type of drift before performance degrades significantly.
- Evidence anchors: [section V.A] "Virtual drift... refers to the non-stationarity of the marginal distribution P(X)... Real drift... refers to the non-stationarity of the posterior distribution P(Y|X)"; [abstract] "Concept drift is a critical challenge faced in online learning, and this work formally approaches it as part of the system behavior characteristics"
- Break condition: If drift is too sudden or too subtle, detection fails and the system continues to use outdated models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework separates concerns between system structure (input/output spaces) and system behavior (probability measures), enabling modular design and analysis.
- Mechanism: Structural changes (e.g., feature addition/removal) are isolated from behavioral changes (distribution shifts), allowing targeted updates—either adjust mappings for structural mismatches or retrain for behavioral drift.
- Core assumption: The decomposition into structure and behavior is meaningful and that interventions can be applied independently without unintended coupling.
- Evidence anchors: [section III.C] "Traditionally, ML approaches focus on the decomposition of learning into the problem and the solution. In this paper, the use of system structure {X, Y} and system behavior in terms of the joint distribution P(X,Y) is proposed instead"; [section IV] "An important aspect of system structure for OL systems is the relationship between the learning system structures at successive time steps"
- Break condition: If structure and behavior are tightly coupled in practice (e.g., feature removal changes the underlying data generation process), the separation breaks down.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Abstract Learning Systems Theory (ALST)
  - Why needed here: Provides the formal language (input-output systems, probability measures on functions) to describe online learning as a dynamic system.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a functional system and a general input-output system in ALST?

- Concept: Homomorphism between system structures
  - Why needed here: Enables modeling of partially heterogeneous systems by mapping one system's input/output space onto another's, preserving structural relationships.
  - Quick check question: How do you verify that two system structures are homomorphic?

- Concept: Concept drift types (virtual vs real)
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes between distribution shifts in inputs vs. shifts in the target concept, guiding appropriate update strategies.
  - Quick check question: If only P(X) changes but P(Y|X) remains constant, what type of drift is this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data stream handler -> Structure monitor -> Mapping engine -> Learner core; Data stream handler -> Behavior monitor -> Learner core
- Critical path: Data stream → Structure monitor → (if drift) Mapping engine → Learner core update; Data stream → Behavior monitor → (if drift) Learner core retraining
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Detection latency vs. detection accuracy: faster detection may miss subtle drifts
  - Homomorphism complexity vs. update frequency: complex mappings may be accurate but expensive
  - Memory usage vs. adaptability: storing more history improves adaptation but increases resource needs
- Failure signatures:
  - Persistent performance degradation despite updates
  - High variance in mapping engine outputs indicating unstable structure
  - Drift detection rate exceeds update rate (system overwhelmed)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulate a synthetic stream with known gradual virtual drift; verify structure monitor detects changes in P(X) without P(Y|X) shift
  2. Simulate a stream with sudden real drift; verify behavior monitor detects change in P(Y|X) and triggers learner retraining
  3. Simulate a stream with feature addition; verify mapping engine constructs valid homomorphism and learner adapts without full retraining

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we formally define and measure the complexity and variability of system behavior in online learning systems, particularly in relation to concept drift?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses complexity and variability as subjective characteristics relative to system structure and system behavior, and mentions the need to understand these aspects for controlling system robustness and reliability.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies these as important aspects but does not provide a formal framework for measuring or quantifying complexity and variability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal mathematical framework for quantifying system behavior complexity and variability, validated through empirical studies on various online learning systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective methods for detecting and localizing concept drift in online learning systems, considering different patterns of drift (gradual, incremental, sudden)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses concept drift as a critical challenge and mentions various patterns of drift, but does not provide a comprehensive framework for detection and localization.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the importance of drift detection, it does not offer a detailed methodology for addressing the different types and patterns of drift.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of drift detection algorithms across different online learning scenarios, with metrics for sensitivity, specificity, and localization precision.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can external knowledge, such as expert input, be effectively integrated into online learning systems to relate system structures when no homogeneous substructures exist?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that external knowledge could be used to relate system structures when no homogeneous substructures are present, but does not elaborate on how this integration should be done.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the potential role of external knowledge but does not provide a framework for its integration into the learning system.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies demonstrating successful integration of expert knowledge into online learning systems, with measurable improvements in system performance.

## Limitations

- Absence of empirical validation; all claims are theoretical and rely on formal definitions rather than experimental results
- Framework's practical effectiveness remains untested with no verification of drift detection accuracy or homomorphism stability
- Separation of structure and behavior may not always be meaningful in practice, especially when structural changes affect the data generation process

## Confidence

- Formalization claims: Medium (logically consistent and well-referenced)
- Practical applicability claims: Low (depend on unverified assumptions about drift detection accuracy and homomorphism stability)
- Theoretical framework claims: Medium (based on established systems theory literature)

## Next Checks

1. Implement the framework on a controlled synthetic dataset with known drift patterns to verify detection and adaptation accuracy
2. Test the homomorphism mappings on partially heterogeneous structures to assess their robustness
3. Compare the framework's performance against standard online learning baselines under varying drift conditions
