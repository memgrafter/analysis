# The Embodied World Model Based on LLM with Visual Information and Prediction-Oriented Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00765
- Reference count: 3
- Key outcome: Encoding visual information and using prediction-oriented prompts improves embodied AI performance in Minecraft.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be enhanced as world models for embodied AI by incorporating visual information and explicit future prediction prompts. The authors extend the VOYAGER agent to use visual data via GPT-4o and introduce prompts that require the LLM to predict future states before suggesting actions. Experiments in Minecraft show that encoding visual information—especially through element extraction—leads to faster milestone achievement, while prediction-oriented prompts improve task consistency and reduce iteration counts. The results suggest that both visual encoding and future-oriented prompts strengthen the LLM's ability to simulate and plan in embodied tasks.

## Method Summary
The method extends VOYAGER, an LLM-based embodied agent in Minecraft, to use visual information via GPT-4o and introduces prediction-oriented prompts that explicitly ask the LLM to predict future states before suggesting actions. Experiments compare four visual information input methods (direct use, free description encoding, element extraction encoding, and no visual input) and two prompt types (conventional and prediction-oriented). Performance is measured by the number of task generation iterations required to achieve milestones leading to the final goal of creating a golden pickaxe.

## Key Results
- Using encoded visual information (especially via element extraction) leads to faster milestone achievement compared to direct image use or no visual input.
- Prediction-oriented prompts reduce task iteration counts and increase task consistency by making the LLM explicitly plan toward the final goal.
- Direct image input can interfere with inference by causing the LLM to overemphasize visual cues at the expense of task logic.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Encoding visual information into text before passing it to the LLM improves milestone achievement speed compared to direct image use.
- Mechanism: By converting images into structured textual descriptions, the model receives focused, task-relevant information without being overwhelmed by raw visual complexity. This encoding filters and prioritizes environmental cues such as nearby blocks or entities, enabling more efficient inference.
- Core assumption: The LLM can interpret structured text about the environment as effectively as raw image data, and the encoding preserves necessary details for task planning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using encoded visual information (especially via element extraction) leads to faster milestone achievement compared to direct image use or no visual input."
  - [section] "it was found that using information extracted from images in the element extraction format allows for faster passage through milestones... more situation-specific action planning could be conducted."
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct corpus neighbor discusses image-to-text encoding for embodied agents.
- Break condition: If the encoding process loses critical spatial or visual detail, or if the LLM struggles to parse the structured text, performance may degrade or match the no-visual baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prediction-oriented prompts increase task consistency and reduce iteration counts by explicitly instructing the LLM to simulate future steps and environmental changes before proposing actions.
- Mechanism: By forcing the LLM to output both a conventional next task and a predicted sequence toward the goal, the model must internally simulate outcomes, constraints, and intermediate states. This explicit simulation reduces unrealistic task proposals and aligns planning with feasible progressions.
- Core assumption: The LLM's learned world model can generate coherent future predictions when prompted, and these predictions improve planning quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Prediction-oriented prompts reduce task iteration counts and increase task consistency by making the LLM explicitly plan toward the final goal."
  - [section] "the virtual type was able to propose the installation of a furnace, necessary for the generation of gold ingots... by considering the steps to acquiring the golden pickaxe, the changes in the situation after each step, and potential risks..."
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus neighbor explicitly discusses future prediction prompting in embodied agents.
- Break condition: If the LLM's internal world model is shallow or inconsistent, explicit future prediction prompts may produce incoherent plans or fail to improve consistency.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal input (text + image) can interfere with inference if the model overemphasizes visual cues at the expense of inventory and task logic.
- Mechanism: Direct image input introduces abundant visual data that may distract the LLM from core task-relevant signals (e.g., inventory state, crafting requirements). The model may propose actions based on visible blocks rather than logical progression, leading to inefficiencies.
- Core assumption: The LLM's inference process is sensitive to input modality balance, and raw visual data can bias task proposals away from optimal planning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "it was found that direct utilization of images had a rather counterproductive effect on milestone achievement... suggesting to acquire surrounding spruce trees based on the presence of those blocks... This can be interpreted as a result of excessive reliance on information from visual sources."
  - [corpus] Weak: no corpus neighbor discusses multimodal interference in embodied AI.
- Break condition: If the LLM can effectively filter and prioritize multimodal inputs, or if the task context makes visual cues highly relevant, the interference effect may not appear.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: World models in embodied AI
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on the idea that agents simulate future scenarios before acting; understanding how world models operate in both traditional and LLM contexts is essential to grasp the proposed enhancements.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary function of a world model in autonomous driving, and how does it relate to embodied AI task planning?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and information encoding
  - Why needed here: The experiments hinge on converting visual data into text and assessing its impact; knowing how modality conversion affects model performance is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: How does encoding visual information into text differ from direct image input in terms of information fidelity and model inference?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and future prediction in LLMs
  - Why needed here: The paper's key innovation is prompting the LLM to predict future states; understanding how prompt structure influences internal simulation is vital for replicating or extending the approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between conventional task prompts and prediction-oriented prompts in terms of expected LLM output and reasoning depth?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Minecraft environment -> Mineflayer motor control -> GPT-4o visual processing -> LLM backend (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) -> Prompt engine -> Task execution loop
- Critical path: 1. Capture current state (inventory, position, nearby blocks/entities, time) 2. Encode visual data if enabled 3. Generate Response1 (next task) and Response2 (future prediction + task) 4. Select task based on experimental condition 5. Execute task in Minecraft 6. Log results and repeat until goal or iteration limit
- Design tradeoffs: Direct vs. encoded visual input: richer data vs. focused inference; Prediction-oriented vs. conventional prompts: explicit planning vs. simpler task flow; Multimodal complexity vs. model interpretability and control
- Failure signatures: Excessive iterations with no milestone progress; Task proposals that ignore inventory constraints or environmental feasibility; High mismatch rate between Response1 and Response2 (indicating weak internal prediction); Frequent "N/A" outputs from visual encoding (poor image quality or model confusion)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Replicate element extraction visual encoding and measure milestone iteration counts vs. no-visual baseline; 2. Implement prediction-oriented prompts and compare task consistency and iteration counts to conventional prompts; 3. Test direct image input and observe whether task proposals are biased by visible blocks rather than logical progression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Open Question 1: Does incorporating visual information with LLMs improve embodied AI performance across different environments beyond Minecraft, such as real-world robotics or other simulated environments? (Basis: study focuses solely on Minecraft)
- Open Question 2: How do different multimodal inputs (e.g., combining visual, auditory, or haptic data) impact the effectiveness of LLMs as world models in embodied AI? (Basis: paper only examines visual data as an additional input)
- Open Question 3: Can prediction-oriented prompts enhance LLM functionality as world models in tasks with higher uncertainty or more complex goals, such as defeating enemy characters or navigating unpredictable environments? (Basis: experiments focus on a well-defined task with a clear goal)

## Limitations
- Experiments are limited to Minecraft and don't explore generalization to other environments or real-world robotics applications.
- Only GPT-family models are used, restricting generalizability to other LLM architectures.
- Experiments focus on a single embodied task (creating a golden pickaxe) with a clear goal, not exploring more complex or uncertain scenarios.

## Confidence
- High: Visual encoding (especially element extraction) improves milestone achievement speed.
- Medium: Prediction-oriented prompts improve task consistency and reduce iteration counts.
- Low: Multimodal interference (visual cues distracting from task logic) is inferred rather than directly measured.

## Next Checks
1. Test whether encoding visual information into text (element extraction) outperforms direct image input across multiple embodied tasks and environments beyond Minecraft.
2. Compare prediction-oriented prompts against conventional prompts in terms of internal simulation quality (e.g., coherence of Response2 predictions) and task success rate.
3. Evaluate whether the observed multimodal interference persists when the LLM is fine-tuned or prompted to prioritize non-visual inputs (e.g., inventory, task logic) over visual cues.
