# Extrinsic Evaluation of Cultural Competence in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2406.11565
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11565
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** Model outputs vary with nationality cues but show weak correlation with established cultural value metrics

## Executive Summary
This work presents an extrinsic evaluation framework for assessing cultural competence in large language models through two user-facing text generation tasks: open-ended question answering and story generation. The authors systematically vary nationalities in prompts and analyze how model outputs adapt, using both quantitative lexical variance measures and qualitative cultural keyword analysis. They find that while models do adapt their outputs to different nationalities using culturally relevant words, these adaptations show weak correlation with established cultural value frameworks like Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions and World Values Survey. This misalignment between intrinsic and extrinsic measures suggests the need for more comprehensive evaluation approaches that account for culture's multi-faceted and dynamic nature.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate six LLMs (GPT 3.5 Turbo, Gemma 2B/7B instruct, Llama 2 7B/13B chat, Llama 3 8B instruct) using prompts that vary nationalities across 195 countries. For QA, they use 345 topics across 13 categories with 100-token limits; for story generation, they use 35 children's story topics with 1000-token limits. Each prompt is sampled 5 times at temperature 0.3. They measure lexical variance using Word Edit Distance between all output pairs, extract culturally relevant words using TF-IDF scoring, and compute Kendall's τc rank correlation between BLEU text similarity and cultural value distances from Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions and World Values Survey.

## Key Results
- Model outputs show measurable lexical variance when nationalities are explicitly mentioned in prompts
- Story generation exhibits higher median variance than QA across all evaluated models
- Weak correlations exist between text similarity of outputs and cultural values from established surveys
- TF-IDF analysis identifies culturally relevant words specific to different nationalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Perturbing nationalities in prompts induces measurable lexical variance in model outputs.
- **Mechanism:** Nationality cues trigger retrieval of culturally associated words and names, creating output differences quantified by pairwise Word Edit Distance.
- **Core assumption:** Lexical differences are driven by nationality cues rather than random generation variance.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract finding of output variation with culturally relevant words; WED measurement methodology.
- **Break condition:** If within-nationality variance matches across-nationality variance, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Weak correlation between text similarity and cultural values implies intrinsic and extrinsic measures are not aligned.
- **Mechanism:** Kendall's τc rank correlation between BLEU text similarity rankings and cultural value rankings shows low correlation.
- **Core assumption:** Cultural value surveys are valid proxies for cultural similarity.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract finding of weak correlations; Kendall's τc methodology.
- **Break condition:** If correlation rises above moderate levels, the misalignment claim collapses.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Task type affects magnitude of lexical variance; creative tasks allow more cultural adaptation.
- **Mechanism:** Story generation's creative nature and longer outputs permit richer cultural variation than constrained QA.
- **Core assumption:** Creative generation allows broader vocabulary and stylistic choices than factual answering.
- **Evidence anchors:** Finding that story generation has higher median variance than QA.
- **Break condition:** If factual QA topics allow equal cultural variation, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Lexical variance measurement using pairwise Word Edit Distance
  - **Why needed here:** To quantify how much model outputs change when nationality is varied.
  - **Quick check question:** If output A is "The child ate pizza" and output B is "The kid had pasta", what does the WED tell you about cultural adaptation?

- **Concept:** Kendall's τc rank correlation for ordinal alignment
  - **Why needed here:** To test whether outputs for culturally similar countries are themselves more textually similar.
  - **Quick check question:** If two countries have outputs ranked [1,2,3] for similarity and [3,2,1] for cultural distance, what is τc and what does it imply?

- **Concept:** TF-IDF scoring for cultural keyword extraction
  - **Why needed here:** To surface words most characteristic of outputs for a given country.
  - **Quick check question:** If "cricket" scores high TF-IDF for India but low for Brazil, what does that suggest about cultural relevance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Prompt template builder -> LLM API client -> Tokenized output store -> Variance calculator -> Correlation engine -> TF-IDF analyzer
- **Critical path:** Prompt -> API call -> Output capture -> Lexical variance computation -> TF-IDF extraction -> Correlation analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:** BLEU vs WED (speed vs sensitivity); 5 samples per prompt (coverage vs cost); 100 vs 1000 token limits (task nature vs truncation)
- **Failure signatures:** Zero variance across nationalities (model ignores cue); high within-nationality variance matching across (random dominates); strong correlation with cultural values (memorization vs adaptation)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Generate outputs for same nationality 10 times; verify within-variance consistently lower than across-variance.
  2. Pick 5 countries with known HCD distances; compute τc; confirm weak/negative correlation.
  3. Manually inspect top TF-IDF words for a country; check for obvious cultural artifacts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the magnitude of lexical variance differ between creative tasks like story generation and more factual tasks like open-ended question answering when nationalities are explicitly mentioned in prompts?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors observe story generation has higher median variance than QA across models.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper does not provide detailed breakdown of specific variance magnitudes or statistical comparison between tasks.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Statistical analysis comparing variance magnitudes between tasks, controlling for model and topic.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do cultural values from surveys like Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions and World Values Survey correlate with the actual content and style of model outputs when nationalities are perturbed in prompts?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors find weak correlations between text similarity and cultural values from these surveys.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper does not explore reasons behind weak correlations or investigate alternative cultural value measures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Investigation into reasons for weak correlations and exploration of alternative cultural value measures.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do implicit cues of culture, such as dialect or topical differences in queries, influence model outputs compared to explicit cues like nationality mentions?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors mention they do not consider implicit cultural cues in their evaluation.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper focuses on explicit cues and does not explore impact of implicit cues on model outputs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation using prompts with implicit cultural cues compared to explicit nationality mentions.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** What are the potential implications of model adaptations triggered by explicit and implicit cues of culture on user experience and satisfaction?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors discuss need for comprehensive human evaluation to understand whether model adaptations are useful or desired.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper does not include human evaluation studies to assess user perceptions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** User studies evaluating satisfaction and perceptions of adapted model outputs.

### Open Question 5
- **Question:** How can the evaluation of cultural competence in LLMs be made more holistic by accounting for the multi-faceted, intersectional, and dynamic nature of culture?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors discuss need to account for multi-faceted, intersectional, and dynamic nature of culture.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper does not provide specific recommendations or methods for incorporating these aspects.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and implementation of evaluation methods incorporating diverse, dynamic measures of culture.

## Limitations

- The correlation analysis relies on cultural value surveys that may not capture all relevant cultural dimensions or contain measurement biases
- Lexical variance measurement assumes nationality cues are the primary driver of output differences, not accounting for random generation variance
- TF-IDF analysis identifies culturally relevant words but cannot establish whether these reflect genuine cultural understanding or memorized associations
- Reliance on BLEU for text similarity may miss semantic or cultural nuances in outputs
- Only 5 samples per prompt may not adequately capture the full distribution of possible outputs

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Model outputs vary with nationality cues (supported by robust lexical variance measurements across multiple models and tasks); Story generation shows higher variance than QA (consistent with creative nature and increased token allowance)

**Medium Confidence:** Weak correlation between text similarity and cultural values (statistically valid but may be influenced by survey limitations); TF-IDF identifies culturally relevant words (methodologically sound but may not indicate deep understanding)

**Low Confidence:** Claim that intrinsic and extrinsic measures are not aligned (requires further validation with more measure pairs); Interpretation that lexical variance represents cultural adaptation (may conflate genuine understanding with surface-level associations)

## Next Checks

1. **Within-vs-Across Variance Validation:** Generate 20 outputs for the same prompt (same topic and nationality) at temperature 0.3. Calculate average pairwise variance within this set and compare to average variance between different nationalities. If within-variance exceeds 50% of across-variance, reevaluate the nationality cue hypothesis.

2. **Cultural Value Survey Cross-Validation:** Repeat correlation analysis using alternative cultural value datasets (GLOBE study or Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map) alongside Hofstede's dimensions. If correlations remain weak across multiple survey types, confidence in misalignment finding increases. If correlations vary significantly by survey, original finding may be survey-dependent.

3. **Semantic Similarity Validation:** Replace BLEU with semantic similarity measures (SBERT embeddings cosine similarity) to compute text similarity between outputs. Recalculate Kendall's τc correlations. If semantic similarity yields stronger or different correlation patterns than BLEU, original lexical-based analysis may miss important cultural adaptations that preserve meaning but use different words.
