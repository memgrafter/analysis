# End-to-End Ontology Learning with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.23584
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23584
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OLLM outperforms traditional subtask-based methods in ontology learning

## Executive Summary
OLLM introduces a novel end-to-end approach for ontology learning using large language models (LLMs). Instead of solving subtasks like concept discovery and relation extraction separately, OLLM finetunes an LLM to model entire subgraphs of the target ontology, then combines these subgraphs through summation and pruning. To address overfitting to high-frequency concepts during training, a custom regularizer randomly masks loss contributions for frequent relations. For evaluation, the authors propose new metrics that use deep learning techniques to compare semantic and structural similarity between graphs, rather than relying on literal text matching. Experiments on Wikipedia and arXiv demonstrate that OLLM outperforms traditional subtask-based methods, producing more semantically accurate ontologies while maintaining structural integrity. The model can also be effectively adapted to new domains with minimal training examples.

## Method Summary
OLLM finetunes an LLM to model entire subgraphs of target ontologies using path-based linearization. During training, a masked loss objective randomly suppresses loss contributions for frequently occurring relations to prevent overfitting. The model generates subgraphs for each document, which are then combined through summation and pruned based on edge weights. Evaluation uses novel deep learning-based metrics that measure semantic similarity through sentence embeddings and structural similarity through graph convolutions, moving beyond literal text matching approaches.

## Key Results
- OLLM outperforms traditional subtask-based methods on Wikipedia and arXiv datasets
- Custom masked loss objective reduces overfitting to high-frequency concepts
- Novel evaluation metrics capture semantic and structural similarity more effectively than literal matching
- OLLM achieves effective domain adaptation with minimal training examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: OLLM's subgraph modeling approach improves semantic accuracy compared to subtask-based methods.
- Mechanism: Instead of learning individual relations, OLLM finetunes an LLM to model entire subgraphs, allowing the model to learn higher-order structures and interactions between multiple nodes simultaneously.
- Core assumption: The hierarchical structure of ontologies can be effectively captured through path-based linearisation of subgraphs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology"
  - [section]: "The relevant subgraph is the set of nodes (concepts) and edges (taxonomic relations) that occur at least once in the relevant paths"
- Break condition: If the path length N is too small, important higher-order structures may be missed. If too large, subgraphs become too complex to model effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The masked loss objective reduces overfitting to high-frequency concepts and improves generalization.
- Mechanism: During training, loss contribution for frequently occurring relations is randomly masked based on their occurrence count, preventing the model from memorizing common patterns.
- Core assumption: High-level concepts are more frequent and diverse than low-level concepts, causing imbalanced learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we propose a custom regulariser that reweights each concept based on its frequency of occurrence"
  - [section]: "During training, when u → v appears in one of the relevant paths, we mask the loss contribution of the tokens for v with probability max(1 − M/n, 0)"
- Break condition: If M is set too low, the model may not learn important high-frequency patterns. If too high, overfitting may persist.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The new evaluation metrics provide more robust semantic and structural similarity measures compared to literal text matching.
- Mechanism: Uses pretrained text embedders and graph convolutions to compare semantic similarity of nodes and edges, and structural similarity of subgraphs, rather than relying on exact string matching.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity between ontology concepts can be effectively captured through sentence embeddings and graph-aware node embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our metrics use deep learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs"
  - [section]: "We utilise embeddings from a pretrained sentence transformer [38] and use the cosine similarity of the embeddings to measure semantic similarity"
- Break condition: If the embedding model fails to capture relevant semantic relationships, or if graph convolutions don't adequately represent local neighborhood structures.

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Theory:
  - Why needed here: Understanding ontology as directed graphs, paths, subgraphs, and network motifs is fundamental to both the modeling approach and evaluation metrics.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of subgraph size N affect the balance between capturing important structures and model complexity?

- Language Model Fine-tuning:
  - Why needed here: OLLM requires custom fine-tuning strategies including the masked loss objective and path-based linearisation.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between using different linearisation strategies (BFS vs DFS vs path-based) for graph modeling?

- Evaluation Metrics Design:
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces novel metrics that go beyond literal text matching to capture semantic and structural similarity.
  - Quick check question: How do the different metrics (Literal F1, Fuzzy F1, Continuous F1, Graph F1) complement each other in evaluating ontology quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Collection -> Subgraph Generation -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Post-processing -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  Document → Subgraph Generation → LLM Inference → Post-processing → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Path length N vs subgraph complexity and modeling accuracy
  - Masked loss hyperparameter M vs overfitting vs underfitting
  - Post-processing hyperparameters α and β vs edge pruning sensitivity
  - Embedding model choice vs semantic similarity capture quality

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor generalization on unseen concepts: Check masked loss effectiveness and path length
  - Low structural integrity: Check post-processing thresholds and subgraph generation
  - Semantic mismatches: Verify embedding model quality and metric design

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run Hearst patterns and REBEL baselines with ground truth concepts to establish ceiling performance
  2. Ablation study: Compare OLLM with and without masked loss objective on validation set
  3. Transfer learning: Fine-tune OLLM on small arXiv dataset and evaluate performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but based on the limitations section, several open questions arise:

- How can OLLM be extended to handle non-taxonomic relations in ontologies?
- What is the optimal subgraph modeling path length (N) for different ontology types?
- How does OLLM perform on ontologies with significantly different structural properties than Wikipedia and arXiv?

## Limitations
- Limited evidence for cross-domain generalization beyond Wikipedia and arXiv
- Reliance on path-based linearisation may not capture all relevant ontological structures
- Masked loss objective requires careful hyperparameter tuning without sufficient ablation studies

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims:**
- OLLM outperforms traditional subtask-based methods on the tested datasets
- The new evaluation metrics provide more nuanced similarity measures than literal text matching
- End-to-end ontology learning with LLMs is feasible and produces semantically accurate results

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The masked loss objective effectively reduces overfitting to high-frequency concepts
- OLLM's performance generalizes to new domains with minimal training examples
- The specific subgraph size (N=2) is optimal for balancing complexity and accuracy

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- OLLM would maintain performance advantage on domains significantly different from Wikipedia/ArXiv
- The chosen linearisation strategy is optimal compared to alternatives
- The post-processing parameters (α, β) are universally applicable across different ontology sizes

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Robustness Test**: Evaluate OLLM on 3-5 diverse domains (e.g., biomedical literature, legal documents, software documentation) with varying concept frequencies and structures to assess generalization beyond Wikipedia and arXiv.

2. **Linearisation Strategy Ablation**: Compare OLLM's performance using different graph linearization approaches (BFS, DFS, random walks) while keeping all other components constant to determine if the path-based approach is optimal.

3. **Masked Loss Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct a systematic hyperparameter sweep for the masking constant M across different ontology sizes and concept frequency distributions to identify optimal settings and failure conditions.
