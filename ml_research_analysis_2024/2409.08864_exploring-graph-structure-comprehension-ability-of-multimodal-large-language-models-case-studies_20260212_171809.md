# Exploring Graph Structure Comprehension Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Case Studies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08864
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08864
- Authors: Zhiqiang Zhong; Davide Mottin
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Multimodal input (text + image) enhances LLM performance on graph tasks, especially for global properties like cycle detection

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether visual representations of graphs improve multimodal large language models' performance on graph comprehension tasks. The authors introduce GAI+, a framework that augments textual graph descriptions with visual depictions generated using Matplotlib. Evaluating GPT-4o and GPT-4-turbo across various graph tasks using different prompt strategies, they find that multimodal models significantly outperform specialized graph encoding models. Visual input consistently enhances accuracy, particularly for global graph properties, though visual-only representations prove insufficient. The work demonstrates both the promise and limitations of using visual modalities for graph comprehension in LLMs.

## Method Summary
The study generates 500 Erdös–Rényi graphs with 5-20 nodes, encoding them textually through adjacency and incident methods while creating visual representations via Matplotlib. Five prompt strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought variants) are applied with and without visual graph information. GPT-4o and GPT-4-turbo are queried as black-box models across graph tasks including node degree, edge existence, cycle detection, triangle counting, shortest path, and node/edge counting. Performance is evaluated through accuracy metrics, comparing multimodal approaches against text-only baselines and specialized graph encoding models.

## Key Results
- Multimodal input (text + image) improves LLM performance on graph tasks compared to text-only representations
- GPT-4o and GPT-4 significantly outperform older models like PaLM on graph comprehension tasks
- Visual-only graph representations are insufficient for LLM comprehension; text input remains necessary

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal input (text + image) improves LLM performance on graph tasks compared to text-only representations.
- Mechanism: The visual modality provides spatial and structural information that complements the textual encoding, especially for global graph properties like cycle detection.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively integrate information from both text and image inputs when processing graph-related queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our experiments compare the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual graph representations. The results provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of leveraging visual graph modalities to enhance LLMs' graph structure comprehension abilities."
  - [section] "Our results show that incorporating graph visualisations can enhance LLMs' graph comprehension, though this effect is not uniform across all tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations to this specific claim, but related work on multimodal graph learning exists in corpus neighbors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Recent multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4) significantly outperform older models (PaLM) on graph comprehension tasks.
- Mechanism: Advancements in multimodal LLM architecture and training have enhanced their ability to process and reason about graph structures presented in both textual and visual formats.
- Core assumption: The improvements in multimodal LLM performance are due to architectural and training advancements rather than just increased model size.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A impressive observation from our results is the markedly superior performance of GPT-4o and GPT-4 compared to the PaLM model. In several tasks, these newer models demonstrate near-perfect accuracy, correctly answering questions about graph structures for almost all test cases."
  - [section] "This substantial improvement indicates that recent advancements in multimodal LLMs have significantly enhanced their graph structure comprehension abilities."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations to this specific claim, but the referenced paper [3] (GPT-4 technical report) supports general LLM advancements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Visual-only graph representations are insufficient for LLM graph comprehension; text input is still necessary.
- Mechanism: LLMs rely on textual descriptions to provide context and meaning to visual information, and cannot fully infer graph structure from images alone.
- Core assumption: The LLM's understanding of graph concepts and terminology is primarily derived from textual input, and visual input serves as a supplementary source of structural information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Interestingly, we found that providing only graph visualisations, without accompanying textual descriptions, is insufficient for LLMs to fully comprehend graph structures."
  - [section] "This observation highlights the complementary nature of visual and textual information in graph comprehending tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations to this specific claim, but related work on multimodal learning suggests the importance of aligned text-image pairs.

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: What is the degree of a node in an undirected graph?

- Concept: Multimodal machine learning (text and image processing)
  - Why needed here: The study combines textual and visual representations of graphs, requiring knowledge of how multimodal models process and integrate information from different modalities.
  - Quick check question: How do multimodal models typically handle input from different modalities?

- Concept: Prompt engineering for LLMs
  - Why needed here: The study uses various prompt strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) to elicit graph comprehension from LLMs, requiring knowledge of effective prompt design.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of few-shot prompting in LLM applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph Generation -> Graph Text Encoder -> Graph Visualiser -> Prompt Construction -> LLMs

- Critical path:
  1. Generate graph dataset
  2. Encode graphs textually and visually
  3. Construct prompts with/without visual information
  4. Input prompts to multimodal LLMs
  5. Evaluate LLM performance on graph tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Visual vs. textual graph representation: Balancing information density and visual clarity
  - Graph complexity: Evaluating performance across simple and complex graphs
  - Prompt strategy: Choosing between zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor LLM performance on visual-only graph representations
  - Inconsistent performance across different graph tasks and complexities
  - Difficulty in generating clear and informative graph visualizations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4 performance on simple graphs with textual and visual input
  2. Compare multimodal LLM performance with specialized graph encoding models
  3. Analyze the impact of graph complexity on multimodal LLM comprehension abilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal ways to visually represent different types of graph structures for multimodal LLM comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that different visualization techniques could influence results and notes that this is an area for future investigation.
- Why unresolved: The study used a standardized approach with Matplotlib default settings, acknowledging that this might not be optimal for all graph types and complexities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing various visualization strategies (e.g., interactive/dynamic representations, hierarchical visualizations, alternative encoding techniques) across diverse graph types and evaluating their impact on LLM performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does graph complexity affect the multimodal LLM's ability to extract relevant information from visualizations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows contrasting examples where simple graphs are correctly interpreted but complex graphs lead to incorrect responses, highlighting a critical challenge.
- Why unresolved: The study doesn't systematically analyze how different levels of graph complexity impact visualization effectiveness or explore methods to maintain visual clarity while preserving information density.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study varying graph complexity parameters (node count, edge density, structural properties) and measuring visualization effectiveness at each complexity level.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can interactive or dynamic graph representations improve multimodal LLM comprehension compared to static visualizations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions sampling-based interactive or dynamic graph representations as a potential future direction without testing them.
- Why unresolved: The study only used static visualizations, leaving open the question of whether interactivity could help manage complexity or provide better context for graph comprehension.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing static versus interactive/dynamic visualizations across various graph comprehension tasks, measuring both accuracy and processing efficiency.

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide exact implementation details of adjacency and incident encoding functions, making precise reproduction challenging
- Only two multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o and GPT-4) were tested, with limited comparison to other models beyond a single PaLM baseline
- The study uses only Erdös–Rényi graphs, which may not represent all graph structures found in real-world applications

## Confidence

- High confidence: Multimodal input improves LLM performance on graph tasks compared to text-only representations
- Medium confidence: Recent multimodal LLMs significantly outperform older models due to architectural advancements
- Low confidence: Visual-only graph representations are insufficient for LLM comprehension

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study with alternative graph generation models (e.g., Barabási–Albert) to verify findings aren't specific to Erdös–Rényi graphs
2. Test the framework with additional multimodal LLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude) to assess generalizability across model architectures
3. Conduct ablation studies removing either the visual or textual component to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance
