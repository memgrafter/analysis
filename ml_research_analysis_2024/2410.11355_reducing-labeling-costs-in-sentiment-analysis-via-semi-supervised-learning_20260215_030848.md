# Reducing Labeling Costs in Sentiment Analysis via Semi-Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.11355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11355
- Authors: Minoo Jafarlou; Mario M. Kubek
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Semi-supervised learning with label propagation reduces labeling costs while maintaining competitive accuracy in sentiment analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a semi-supervised learning approach that combines label propagation with deep neural networks to reduce labeling costs in sentiment analysis. The method uses graph-based techniques to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are then used to train models like BiGRU, BiLSTM, and 1D CNN on the IMDb dataset. Results demonstrate that label propagation consistently outperforms baseline models and achieves competitive performance with fully supervised models, particularly when using higher-dimensional embeddings and optimized hyperparameters.

## Method Summary
The approach employs label propagation as a graph-based semi-supervised learning method to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data points. The method constructs a nearest-neighbor graph where nodes represent data points and edges are weighted by cosine similarity of embeddings. Labels are propagated from labeled nodes to unlabeled ones based on their proximity in the graph. The pseudo-labeled data is then used to train deep neural networks (BiGRU, BiLSTM, 1D CNN) initialized with pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe, FastText, Word2Vec). The IMDb dataset is used for evaluation with accuracy, F1 score, and AUC-ROC as metrics.

## Key Results
- Label propagation consistently outperformed baseline models across all embedding types and model architectures
- Higher-dimensional embeddings (300D) showed better performance than lower-dimensional ones (100D)
- The approach achieved competitive performance with fully supervised models while using only a fraction of labeled data
- 1D CNN and BiLSTM models showed particularly strong performance when combined with label propagation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Label propagation improves sentiment analysis accuracy by leveraging graph-based similarity between labeled and unlabeled data points.
- Mechanism: The method constructs a nearest-neighbor graph where nodes represent data points and edges are weighted by cosine similarity of embeddings. Labels are then propagated from labeled nodes to unlabeled ones based on their proximity in the graph, allowing the model to learn from more data without additional labeling.
- Core assumption: Data points that are close in the embedding space are likely to share the same sentiment label (manifold assumption).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By extending labels based on cosine proximity within a nearest neighbor graph from network embeddings, we combine unlabeled data into supervised learning, thereby reducing labeling costs."
  - [section]: "Label propagation is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method... Label propagation considers labeled data as 'sources.' It assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled data based on the cluster assumption..."
- Break condition: If the embedding space does not preserve semantic similarity (e.g., due to poor embeddings or highly ambiguous text), the graph structure will not reflect true label relationships and propagation will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-trained word embeddings provide rich semantic context that improves initial model performance and label propagation accuracy.
- Mechanism: Word embeddings like GloVe, FastText, and Word2Vec initialize the model with semantic relationships learned from large corpora. This helps the model better capture sentiment-relevant features before label propagation, leading to more accurate pseudo-labels.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained embeddings capture general semantic patterns that are transferable to sentiment analysis tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Using the IMDb dataset, the approach was evaluated with various word embeddings (GloVe, FastText, Word2Vec)..."
  - [section]: "Using pre-trained embeddings Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe helps to initialize the baseline model with rich semantic information learned from a large corpus of text."
- Break condition: If the domain of the pre-trained embeddings differs significantly from the sentiment analysis domain (e.g., biomedical vs. movie reviews), the semantic relationships may not transfer effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hyperparameter optimization of deep learning components (layers, hidden dimensions) enhances model capacity to capture complex sentiment patterns.
- Mechanism: Adjusting the number of layers, hidden dimensions, and other architectural parameters allows the model to better represent the hierarchical structure of sentiment in text. Higher capacity models can capture more nuanced patterns but require careful tuning to avoid overfitting.
- Core assumption: Sentiment analysis requires models with sufficient capacity to represent complex linguistic patterns and relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "This experiment considers the performance of baseline, fully supervised, and label propagation models—across different configurations on a BiGRU model. We examine these methods by varying the neural network layers, hidden dimensions..."
  - [section]: "Additionally, increasing hidden dimensions (from 32D to 128D) positively impacts performance as well, particularly for Fully Supervised and Label Propagation methods..."
- Break condition: If hyperparameters are set too high relative to the available data, the model will overfit to noise rather than learning generalizable sentiment patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph-based similarity measures
  - Why needed here: Label propagation relies on measuring similarity between data points to construct the nearest-neighbor graph and propagate labels
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity differ from Euclidean distance when comparing text embeddings?

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data effectively is fundamental to the approach
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between inductive and transductive learning in the context of semi-supervised methods?

- Concept: Neural network architecture for NLP
  - Why needed here: The deep learning models (BiGRU, BiLSTM, CNN) are essential components that process text and learn sentiment patterns
  - Quick check question: How do recurrent neural networks handle sequential dependencies differently than convolutional neural networks in text processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Tokenization → Embedding lookup → Graph construction → Label propagation → Deep learning model → Evaluation
- Critical path: Data → Embeddings → Graph Construction → Label Propagation → Deep Model Training → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Higher-dimensional embeddings capture more information but increase computational cost; more neighbors in graph improve label smoothness but reduce locality; deeper models capture complex patterns but risk overfitting
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on validation set despite good training results (overfitting); similar performance across different embedding types (embedding quality issue); label propagation provides minimal improvement (graph structure not meaningful)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare baseline model performance with different embeddings (GloVe vs. FastText vs. Word2Vec) on a small labeled subset
  2. Implement label propagation with fixed hyperparameters and evaluate impact on a validation set
  3. Vary the number of nearest neighbors in graph construction and measure effect on pseudo-label quality and final accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of label propagation-based semi-supervised learning scale with increasing dataset sizes and more complex models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that scalability is a concern when dealing with large datasets or complex models, and that the computational complexity of label propagation poses challenges, especially with large datasets typical in NLP tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence on how label propagation performance changes with increasing dataset sizes or more complex models. It only mentions the concern about scalability without investigating it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with progressively larger datasets and more complex models, measuring performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, AUC-ROC) and computational resources (time, memory) to determine the scaling behavior.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of k nearest neighbors for the label propagation algorithm in text classification tasks, and how does it vary across different datasets and model configurations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that determining the optimal number of k nearest neighbors is essential for achieving accurate results, but does not provide a systematic investigation of this parameter.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the importance of choosing the right k value, it does not conduct an in-depth analysis of how different k values affect performance across various datasets and model configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performing a grid search or similar hyperparameter optimization technique to find the optimal k value for different datasets, model architectures, and embedding types, and analyzing the sensitivity of performance to changes in k.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can label propagation be effectively combined with active learning strategies to maximize performance while minimizing labeling efforts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work plans to combine label propagation with active learning strategies to identify and label the most insightful unlabeled data points.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or theoretical framework for integrating label propagation with active learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing an active learning framework that incorporates label propagation, evaluating its performance against standard label propagation and active learning methods in terms of accuracy, labeling efficiency, and convergence speed.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks critical implementation details for label propagation (gamma value, iteration count, graph normalization method)
- Hyperparameter tuning methodology for deep learning models is not clearly described
- No systematic analysis of how performance scales with dataset size or model complexity

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general methodology of combining label propagation with deep learning for sentiment analysis is sound and well-supported by the literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that label propagation consistently outperforms baselines is plausible but requires verification of implementation details and hyperparameter settings.
- **Low confidence**: The specific performance metrics (accuracy, F1, AUC-ROC) for different embedding types and model architectures need independent validation due to missing implementation specifics.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce baseline performance: Train BiGRU models with specified embeddings on a small labeled subset to verify baseline accuracy claims.
2. Implement label propagation: Create the nearest-neighbor graph with cosine similarity and test label propagation on validation data to confirm pseudo-label quality.
3. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary the number of layers, hidden dimensions, and nearest neighbors to map the performance landscape and identify optimal configurations.
