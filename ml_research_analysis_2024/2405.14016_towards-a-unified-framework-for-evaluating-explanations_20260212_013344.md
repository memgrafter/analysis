# Towards a Unified Framework for Evaluating Explanations
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14016
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14016
- Reference count: 0
- This paper proposes a unified framework for evaluating explanations in educational contexts, synthesizing concepts from ML and HCI communities

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in standardized evaluation frameworks for explainable AI (XAI) within educational settings. The authors propose a unified framework that introduces a hierarchical structure for evaluating explanations, distinguishing between intelligibility (how well users understand the explanation) and faithfulness (how accurately it reflects the model's internal state). The framework also establishes plausibility and stability as prerequisite criteria that must be satisfied before higher-level requirements can be assessed.

The framework is illustrated through an ongoing study of an interpretable neural network designed to detect student gaming behavior, employing human-grounded evaluation methods including forward and counterfactual simulations. By synthesizing concepts from both machine learning and human-computer interaction communities, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive approach to evaluating XAI explanations that can be adapted across diverse educational contexts and stakeholder groups.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing concepts from ML and HCI communities to construct a unified evaluation framework for XAI explanations. The framework is hierarchical, establishing intelligibility and faithfulness as the primary evaluation criteria, with plausibility and stability serving as prerequisites. The authors demonstrate the framework through an ongoing study of an interpretable neural network for detecting student gaming behavior, using human-grounded evaluation methods such as forward simulations (asking users what would happen if variables change) and counterfactual simulations (asking users what changes would achieve different outcomes). The evaluation approach involves both qualitative and quantitative assessment of explanation quality across different user groups, though specific methodologies are still under development.

## Key Results
- Framework establishes intelligibility and faithfulness as primary evaluation criteria for XAI explanations
- Plausibility and stability are defined as prerequisite criteria that must be satisfied first
- Framework illustrated through ongoing study of neural network for detecting student gaming behavior
- Human-grounded evaluation methods (forward and counterfactual simulations) proposed for assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a structured hierarchy that separates user-centric and model-centric evaluation criteria, allowing for systematic assessment of explanations. By establishing plausibility and stability as prerequisites, it ensures explanations meet basic quality standards before assessing more complex requirements like intelligibility and faithfulness. The distinction between intelligibility (user-dependent understanding) and faithfulness (model accuracy) addresses both the human and technical aspects of XAI evaluation. The framework's adaptability to different educational contexts and stakeholder groups (students, teachers, administrators) makes it broadly applicable while maintaining rigorous evaluation standards.

## Foundational Learning
- **Intelligibility**: The degree to which an explanation can be understood by its intended users - needed to ensure explanations serve their educational purpose; quick check: user comprehension tests across stakeholder groups
- **Faithfulness**: How accurately an explanation reflects the model's internal state - needed to ensure explanations are trustworthy and not misleading; quick check: correlation between explanation features and model decision-making process
- **Plausibility**: Whether an explanation appears reasonable to users - needed as a prerequisite to ensure explanations are initially acceptable; quick check: user surveys on explanation reasonableness
- **Stability**: Consistency of explanations across similar instances - needed to ensure reliability and prevent confusion; quick check: variance in explanations for similar input cases
- **Human-grounded evaluation**: Assessment methods involving actual users rather than proxy metrics - needed to capture real-world usability and understanding; quick check: task completion rates with provided explanations
- **Forward simulation**: Asking users what would happen if variables change - needed to assess understanding of causal relationships; quick check: accuracy of user predictions compared to model behavior

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Explanation Quality Assessment -> Plausibility & Stability Prerequisites -> Intelligibility & Faithfulness Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Plausibility Check -> Stability Check -> Intelligibility Assessment -> Faithfulness Verification
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balance between theoretical rigor and practical applicability; complexity of hierarchical framework vs. ease of implementation
- **Failure signatures**: Explanations failing plausibility may never achieve intelligibility; unstable explanations cannot be faithful; unintelligible explanations fail educational purpose
- **First experiments**: 1) User comprehension tests across different educational stakeholder groups, 2) Stability analysis of explanations across similar student gaming instances, 3) Correlation studies between explanation features and model decision-making

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, though several implications arise from the framework's development and application.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence demonstrating framework performance across diverse educational contexts
- Definition of intelligibility as "user-dependent" lacks concrete operationalization
- Hierarchical structure remains theoretically justified without systematic validation
- Requirement that plausibility and stability be prerequisites is asserted but not empirically demonstrated

## Confidence
- Medium: The conceptual distinction between intelligibility and faithfulness is well-grounded in existing literature
- Medium: The hierarchical framework structure represents a reasonable theoretical approach
- Low: The practical applicability and empirical validation of the framework across diverse educational contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic user studies across multiple educational stakeholder groups to empirically validate the intelligibility criteria and their dependence on user characteristics
2. Test the framework's hierarchical structure by evaluating explanations that satisfy higher-level criteria but fail prerequisite conditions
3. Apply the framework to diverse XAI applications beyond gaming detection to assess its generalizability and identify context-specific adaptations needed
