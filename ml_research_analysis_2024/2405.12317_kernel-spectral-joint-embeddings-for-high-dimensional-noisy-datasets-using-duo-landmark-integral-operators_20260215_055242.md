# Kernel spectral joint embeddings for high-dimensional noisy datasets using duo-landmark integral operators

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12317
- Authors: Xiucai Ding; Rong Ma
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Kernel spectral method using duo-landmark integral operators achieves higher clustering accuracy and manifold reconstruction accuracy compared to alternative approaches for joint embedding of noisy high-dimensional datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a kernel spectral method for joint embedding two high-dimensional noisy datasets that may share nonlinear signal structures. The method employs newly defined duo-landmark integral operators based on convolutional kernel maps in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to capture shared low-dimensional structures. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate that their approach is consistent in recovering the underlying noiseless signals and robust to high-dimensional noise, outperforming existing methods in both embeddings and downstream tasks like clustering and denoising.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs asymmetric cross-data kernel matrices between two datasets and performs spectral decomposition to obtain joint embeddings. It uses a data-adaptive bandwidth parameter selected as the ω-percentile of pairwise between-dataset squared distances. The duo-landmark integral operators are defined using convolutional kernel maps that alternate between the two datasets, creating a mutual learning framework. The method involves centralizing input datasets, constructing the asymmetric kernel matrix, performing singular value decomposition, and extracting joint embeddings using specified index sets.

## Key Results
- The method achieves higher clustering accuracy compared to existing approaches, especially when datasets contain partially shared signal structures
- Numerical experiments show superior manifold reconstruction accuracy across varying noise levels and sample sizes
- Theoretical analysis establishes consistency in recovering low-dimensional noiseless signals and characterizes the effects of signal-to-noise ratios on convergence rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The duo-landmark integral operators capture shared low-dimensional nonlinear structures by alternating convolutional kernel maps across datasets
- Mechanism: The operators are defined using a kernel function that alternates between the two datasets, creating a mutual learning framework where each dataset acts as a landmark for the other
- Core assumption: The shared structures exist in the same low-dimensional manifold space and can be recovered through alternating convolution
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These RKHSs capture the either partially or entirely shared underlying low-dimensional nonlinear signal structures of the two datasets."
  - [section] "The duo-landmark integral operators...are defined by the convolutional kernel maps of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs)."
- Break condition: If the shared structures exist in different manifold spaces or the datasets contain fundamentally different types of information

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The asymmetric cross-data kernel matrix construction excludes self-connections to focus on inter-dataset relationships
- Mechanism: By only connecting points between different datasets and not within the same dataset, the method emphasizes the shared structure while avoiding redundancy from self-similarities
- Core assumption: Self-connections within individual datasets do not provide useful information for understanding shared structures between datasets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "As a result, we exclude 'self-connections' within the individual point cloud X and Y, focusing solely on connecting distinct data points between them."
- Break condition: If the self-connections within datasets contain critical information about the shared structure

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The data-adaptive bandwidth selection using pairwise distances ensures optimal capture of nonlinear structures across varying SNRs
- Mechanism: The bandwidth is chosen as the ω-percentile of pairwise between-dataset squared distances, allowing it to adapt to the unknown nonlinear structures and SNR levels in the data
- Core assumption: The appropriate scale for capturing shared structures can be determined from the distribution of inter-dataset distances
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Such a strategy is motivated by our theoretical analysis of the spectrum of kernel random matrices..."
- Break condition: If the distance distribution does not reflect the appropriate scale for shared structure capture

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)
  - Why needed here: The method relies on constructing RKHSs using convolutional kernel maps to capture shared structures between datasets
  - Quick check question: What property of RKHS ensures that the kernel functions used in this method are positive definite?

- Concept: Spectral Decomposition of Kernel Matrices
  - Why needed here: The joint embeddings are obtained through singular value decomposition of the kernel matrix, which requires understanding how eigenvalues and eigenvectors relate to the underlying data structure
  - Quick check question: How does the eigenvalue spectrum of a kernel matrix relate to the dimensionality of the underlying manifold?

- Concept: Manifold Learning Theory
  - Why needed here: The method assumes the data lies on low-dimensional manifolds and uses manifold learning principles to recover these structures from high-dimensional noisy observations
  - Quick check question: What condition must be satisfied for a high-dimensional dataset to be considered as lying on a low-dimensional manifold?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Bandwidth selection -> Kernel matrix construction -> Spectral decomposition -> Embedding extraction -> Downstream tasks

- Critical path:
  1. Centralize input datasets
  2. Select bandwidth using percentile method
  3. Construct asymmetric kernel matrix
  4. Perform SVD on scaled kernel matrix
  5. Extract joint embeddings using specified index sets

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Asymmetric vs symmetric kernel construction: Asymmetric focuses on inter-dataset relationships but loses within-dataset information
  - Percentile-based vs fixed bandwidth: Adaptive bandwidth handles varying SNRs but adds computational overhead
  - Landmark-based vs full kernel: Landmark approach scales better but may miss fine-grained structure

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering results: May indicate insufficient shared structure or inappropriate bandwidth
  - Unstable embeddings across runs: Could suggest sensitivity to noise or small sample sizes
  - Degenerate kernel matrix: Might occur with inappropriate bandwidth leading to all-zero or all-one matrices

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Synthetic data with known shared structure: Generate two datasets with partial overlap and verify the method recovers the shared components
  2. Varying SNR scenarios: Test performance across different noise levels to validate robustness claims
  3. Sample size imbalance: Evaluate how well the method handles datasets with significantly different numbers of samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise relationship between the duo-landmark integral operators and other established operators like the Laplacian or Laplace-Beltrami operator in manifold learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces duo-landmark integral operators and establishes their connection to kernel matrices and low-dimensional embeddings, but does not provide a direct comparison to classical operators
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows the duo-landmark operators are effective for joint embedding, it does not explicitly compare their properties or theoretical guarantees to those of more traditional operators
- What evidence would resolve it: A rigorous theoretical analysis comparing the spectral properties, convergence rates, and robustness to noise of duo-landmark operators versus classical operators on various manifold structures

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method handle datasets with highly imbalanced sample sizes (n1 >> n2 or vice versa)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the method does not rely on particular assumptions about the relations between n1 and n2, but does not provide specific theoretical guarantees or empirical results for highly imbalanced cases
- Why unresolved: While the method is designed to be flexible, the impact of severe sample size imbalance on the quality of joint embeddings and downstream tasks is not explored
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of the convergence rates and robustness of the method under various ratios of n1 to n2, along with empirical studies on simulated and real datasets with intentionally imbalanced sample sizes

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed method be extended to handle more than two datasets simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on joint embedding of two datasets, but the underlying framework of leveraging shared structures across datasets suggests potential for extension to multiple datasets
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis and algorithm are specifically designed for two datasets, and the extension to more than two datasets would require new mathematical formulations and computational considerations
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a generalized framework for joint embedding of multiple datasets, along with theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the extended method

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on assumptions about manifold structure and noise distributions that may not hold in practice
- Computational complexity increases with sample size, potentially limiting scalability to very large datasets
- The method's performance on real-world datasets with complex, unknown structures requires further validation
