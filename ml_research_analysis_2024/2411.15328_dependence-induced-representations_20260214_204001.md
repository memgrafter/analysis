# Dependence Induced Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.15328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15328
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Framework for learning feature representations that depend only on statistical dependence between paired random variables

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces dependence induced representations, a framework for learning feature representations that capture only the statistical dependence between paired random variables X and Y. The authors establish sufficient and necessary conditions for such representations, connecting them to Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation functions and minimal sufficient statistics. The work characterizes a family of loss functions called D-losses that can learn these representations, showing that optimal features take the form of a composition between a loss-dependent function and the maximal correlation function.

The theoretical framework provides new insights into representation learning and reveals fundamental connections between representations learned from different losses. The authors demonstrate practical applications including a statistical interpretation of the neural collapse phenomenon in deep classifiers and introduce a learning design based on feature separation that enables hyperparameter tuning during inference.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes a theoretical framework for dependence induced representations by defining a family of loss functions (D-losses) that learn features depending only on the statistical dependence between paired random variables. The authors prove sufficient and necessary conditions for these representations, showing that optimal features can be expressed as a composition between a loss-dependent function and the maximal correlation function. The framework is validated through practical examples including cross-entropy loss and support vector machines, demonstrating broad applicability to learning practices.

## Key Results
- Sufficient and necessary conditions established for representations that depend only on statistical dependence between X and Y
- Characterization of D-loss family that can learn dependence induced representations
- Optimal features take form of composition between loss-dependent function and maximal correlation function
- Practical applications include neural collapse interpretation and feature separation learning design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by restricting learned representations to capture only the statistical dependence between input-output pairs, filtering out any information that is not relevant to this dependence structure. This is achieved through the D-loss family, which penalizes representations that contain information beyond what is necessary to capture the dependence relationship. The connection to maximal correlation functions ensures that the learned representations are optimal in terms of preserving the strongest statistical dependencies.

## Foundational Learning
- Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation: Measures the maximum correlation between transformations of two random variables; needed for characterizing optimal dependence-preserving representations; quick check: verify that maximal correlation equals 1 for perfectly dependent variables
- Minimal sufficient statistics: Statistics that capture all information about parameters present in the data; needed for establishing the information-theoretic foundation of dependence induced representations; quick check: confirm that minimal sufficient statistics preserve likelihood ratios
- D-loss family: A class of loss functions designed to learn dependence-preserving representations; needed for practical implementation of the theoretical framework; quick check: verify that D-loss gradients point in direction of maximal correlation functions
- Neural collapse phenomenon: The tendency of deep classifiers to produce similar features for different samples of the same class; needed for interpreting practical implications of the theory; quick check: measure within-class feature variance across network layers

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: X -> Feature Extractor -> Representation Z -> Classifier -> Y

Critical path: The feature extractor must learn representations that maximize dependence with Y while minimizing extraneous information. The classifier operates on these dependence-induced representations.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades off representational capacity for dependence preservation. More complex feature extractors may better approximate the theoretical optimal representations but risk overfitting and computational inefficiency.

Failure signatures: Representations that fail to capture dependence will show low maximal correlation with the target variable. Overfitting occurs when representations capture spurious dependencies present in training data but not generalizable.

First experiments:
1. Verify that cross-entropy loss produces representations with maximal correlation close to theoretical optimum
2. Test feature separation learning by training with different loss functions and measuring representation similarity
3. Implement neural collapse interpretation by measuring within-class feature variance across network depths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical results rely heavily on idealized assumptions about underlying probability distributions
- Connection between D-losses and minimal sufficient statistics assumes access to true data distribution
- Neural collapse interpretation remains largely theoretical with limited empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Empirical validation of feature separation learning across multiple loss functions (cross-entropy, SVM, etc.) with controlled synthetic data where ground truth dependence structure is known

2. Investigation of finite-sample behavior and approximation quality when using parameterized neural networks instead of ideal infinite-dimensional representations

3. Systematic study of hyperparameter tuning during inference in real-world classification tasks, measuring trade-offs between performance and computational overhead
