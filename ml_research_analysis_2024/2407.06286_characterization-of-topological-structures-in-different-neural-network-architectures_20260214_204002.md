## Quick Facts

- Uses TDA methods to analyze neural representations across architectures

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates how different neural network architectures process data by examining the topological structure of their learned representations. Using Topological Data Analysis methods, the work analyzes neural activations from various layers and architectures, computing Vietoris-Rips complexes and persistent homology to understand how architectures transform data topology. The study compares ResNet, VGG19, and ViT models, examining both pre-trained and finetuned versions to understand how training affects topological properties.

The research addresses a fundamental question in deep learning interpretability: how do different architectures encode information differently? By applying computational topology tools to neural representations, the work provides novel insights into the structural differences between architectures, showing that while some models exhibit similar topological patterns, others like ViT demonstrate unique characteristics in their feature representations.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to characterize neural representations. The approach begins with computing Vietoris-Rips complexes from neural activations across different layers, which are then used to calculate persistent homology - a tool that captures topological features at multiple scales. The bottleneck distance metric is used to compare persistent homology diagrams between different layers, architectures, and datasets. The analysis covers multiple architectures including ResNet, VGG19, and ViT, examining both pre-trained and finetuned models on ImageNet. Computational constraints required focusing on specific layer subsets and moderate-sized datasets, with outlier removal preprocessing steps evaluated for their impact on topological measurements.

## Key Results
- Removing outliers has minimal impact on persistent homology results across architectures
- Train and test dataset representations show similar topological structures
- ResNet and VGG19 exhibit topology changes primarily in middle and final layers, while ViT shows unique patterns with more long-living features
- Finetuned models begin to diverge topologically from pre-trained models in middle and later layers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Topological Data Analysis captures intrinsic structural properties of data representations that are invariant to specific geometric transformations. By computing persistent homology from neural activations, the method reveals how architectures organize and transform information in ways that reflect fundamental differences in their design principles. The Vietoris-Rips complex construction captures neighborhood relationships in high-dimensional activation spaces, while persistent homology tracks features that persist across scales, identifying meaningful structural elements rather than noise.

## Foundational Learning

**Persistent Homology**: A tool for analyzing topological features across multiple scales by tracking how homology classes are born and die as a filtration parameter varies. Why needed: Provides multiscale topological description of neural representations. Quick check: Can identify connected components, loops, and voids in data.

**Vietoris-Rips Complex**: A simplicial complex constructed from a point cloud by connecting points within a distance threshold and filling in higher-dimensional simplices. Why needed: Transforms neural activations into topological spaces suitable for homology computation. Quick check: Captures local neighborhood structure in activation space.

**Bottleneck Distance**: A metric for comparing persistence diagrams by measuring the maximum distance between matched points. Why needed: Quantifies topological similarity between representations from different layers or architectures. Quick check: Provides a single scalar value for topological comparison.

**Simplicial Homology**: Algebraic topology tool that counts holes of different dimensions in topological spaces. Why needed: Provides the mathematical foundation for detecting topological features. Quick check: Can distinguish between connected components (H₀), loops (H₁), and voids (H₂).

**Filtration**: A sequence of nested topological spaces used to track how topological features appear and disappear. Why needed: Enables multiscale analysis of neural representations. Quick check: Reveals which features persist across scales versus noise.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Neural network -> Layer activations -> Vietoris-Rips complex construction -> Persistent homology computation -> Bottleneck distance comparison

**Critical Path**: Data flows through neural network layers, producing activation vectors that are collected and processed into Vietoris-Rips complexes, from which persistence diagrams are computed and compared using bottleneck distance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational complexity of Vietoris-Rips complexes limits analysis to moderate-sized datasets and relatively shallow architectures. Choice of distance threshold affects which topological features are captured. Bottleneck distance may miss some structural differences compared to alternative metrics.

**Failure Signatures**: If bottleneck distances are uniformly small across all layers, the method may not be sensitive enough to detect meaningful architectural differences. If computations are too slow, the Vietoris-Rips parameter or dataset size may need reduction.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compute persistence diagrams for a single layer across different random seeds to establish baseline variability, 2) Compare bottleneck distances between consecutive layers within the same architecture, 3) Analyze the effect of different Vietoris-Rips distance thresholds on persistent features.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational constraints limit analysis to moderate-sized datasets and relatively shallow architectures
- Focus on specific architectures (ResNet, VGG19, ViT) and dataset (ImageNet) without broader coverage
- Bottleneck distance as primary metric may not capture all relevant structural differences

## Confidence
- Claims about topological differences between architectures: Medium
- Observation that outlier removal has minimal impact: Medium
- Finding that train/test datasets show similar topology: Medium
- Discovery of unique ViT topological patterns: Medium

## Next Checks
1) Test the robustness of topological observations across multiple random seeds and different initialization schemes
2) Extend the analysis to larger architectures and deeper networks to validate whether observed topological patterns persist at scale
3) Compare bottleneck distance with alternative metrics like Wasserstein distance to ensure findings are not metric-dependent
