# Textless Dependency Parsing by Labeled Sequence Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10118
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10118
- Reference count: 0
- This paper introduces a textless method for dependency parsing from speech signals by directly predicting dependency trees as labeled sequences, without first transcribing audio into text.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to dependency parsing that operates directly on speech signals without requiring text transcription. The method represents dependency trees as concatenated words and annotations, using CTC loss for training. Experiments on French and English show that while a traditional cascading approach (ASR then parser) achieves better overall parsing accuracy, the textless method excels in cases where acoustic features like stress or pitch help disambiguate sentence structure. Results suggest that both word-level representations and sentence-level prosody are important for accurate parsing, pointing to the need for integrating both in future speech parsing systems.

## Method Summary
The textless dependency parsing method represents dependency trees as labeled sequences by concatenating words and their corresponding annotations (POS tags, relative head positions, and dependency relations). The model uses wav2vec2 as a feature extractor, applies a feed-forward neural network to the extracted features, and then uses a linear layer with CTC loss to predict the labeled sequence. During inference, a CTC greedy decoder and SentencePiece are used to decode the predicted sequence back into a dependency tree. The method is trained on speech signals paired with dependency tree annotations, without requiring intermediate text transcription.

## Key Results
- The cascading approach (ASR then parser) outperforms the textless method overall, particularly for predicting longer dependency relationships
- The textless method excels in instances with important acoustic features like stress or pitch that help disambiguate syntactic structure
- Both word-level representations and sentence-level prosody are found to be important for enhanced parsing performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Textless parsing can leverage prosodic cues (stress, pitch) to resolve syntactic ambiguity that word segmentation alone cannot.
- Mechanism: Sentence-level prosody, such as stressed pronunciation, disambiguates between competing syntactic interpretations by highlighting the main verb or key phrase boundaries.
- Core assumption: Prosodic features (intensity, pitch) are reliably encoded in the speech representation and are captured by the wav2vec2 model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the latter excels in instances with important acoustic features"
  - [section] "the stressed pronunciation of 'open' as the complement" and "the stressed pronunciation of 'horseback' elucidates that 'horseback riding' is a compound word"
  - [corpus] Weak: only 6 clear examples found out of 40 collected; causal relationship unclear.
- Break condition: If prosody does not correlate with syntactic role, or if the model fails to capture sentence-level prosodic contours.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Explicit word segmentation (via ASR) improves prediction of long-distance dependency relationships in dependency parsing.
- Mechanism: Word embeddings derived from segmented speech provide a stable, localized context for predicting head positions, especially for non-local dependencies.
- Core assumption: Longer dependency arcs require precise word-level representations that are lost in textless modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Wav2tree outperforms the textless method overall, particularly in predicting longer dependency relationships"
  - [section] "we find that the cascading method outperforms the proposed method overall, particularly in predicting longer dependency relationships"
  - [corpus] Clear: accuracy drops for longer head distances in textless method vs. cascading method.
- Break condition: If the model can learn long-range dependencies from prosodic or acoustic features alone.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CTC-based modeling enforces conditional independence, limiting the model's ability to capture inter-token dependencies.
- Mechanism: CTC assumes each output token is independent of the previous, which prevents the model from learning rich dependencies between consecutive annotations.
- Core assumption: The CTC loss structure is the bottleneck for capturing complex label dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method has a limitation in that it is based solely on CTC, which assumes conditional independence"
  - [section] "CTC-based ASR by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss"
  - [corpus] Explicit: authors state this as a limitation and suggest future work on attention or intermediate CTC.
- Break condition: If alternative decoding strategies (attention, intermediate CTC) do not improve parsing accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss
  - Why needed here: CTC loss enables training without explicit alignment between speech frames and labels, crucial for textless parsing.
  - Quick check question: How does CTC loss handle variable-length alignments between speech frames and output tokens?

- Concept: Dependency parsing representation as labeled sequences
  - Why needed here: Representing dependency trees as concatenated words and annotations allows the use of sequence models for parsing.
  - Quick check question: What constraints must be enforced to ensure valid dependency tree structure when decoding labeled sequences?

- Concept: Prosodic features in speech
  - Why needed here: Prosodic features (stress, pitch, intensity) can disambiguate syntactic structure in spoken language.
  - Quick check question: How can prosodic cues like stress help distinguish between competing syntactic interpretations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Speech -> wav2vec2 -> FNN -> Linear -> CTC decoding -> Post-process to dependency tree
- Critical path: Speech → wav2vec2 → FNN → Linear → CTC decoding → Post-process to dependency tree
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simpler architecture (no separate parser) vs. limited ability to capture long-range dependencies
  - No ASR errors but also no word-level context
  - CTC independence assumption vs. richer attention-based models
- Failure signatures:
  - Low UAS on longer dependencies
  - Poor performance on ambiguous sentences where prosody is weak
  - Over-reliance on generic labels when annotations missing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare UAS on sentences with and without clear prosodic cues
  2. Measure accuracy drop for dependencies longer than 3 hops
  3. Test effect of removing CTC constraint (e.g., via attention decoder) on parsing accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively integrate word-level representations and sentence-level prosody to improve textless dependency parsing performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that incorporating both word-level representations and sentence-level prosody is important for enhanced parsing performance, and suggests this as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for this integration but does not propose or evaluate specific methods for combining these two types of information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing different architectures that integrate word-level and prosodic features, showing improvements in parsing accuracy over textless and cascading approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does sentence-level prosody contribute to syntactic disambiguation in spoken language, beyond the examples shown in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents specific examples where prosody aids in parsing but acknowledges that the causal relationship between sentence-level prosody and syntactic disambiguation remains unclear.
- Why unresolved: The analysis in the paper is limited to a small number of examples, and there is no systematic evaluation of prosody's role in syntactic disambiguation across a broader dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: A large-scale study constructing an evaluation set specifically targeting syntactic disambiguation with audio features, demonstrating the consistent impact of prosody on parsing accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can attention mechanisms or intermediate CTC architectures overcome the limitations of CTC-based textless dependency parsing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that its method is based solely on CTC, which assumes conditional independence, and suggests exploring attention mechanisms or intermediate CTC architectures as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with or evaluate these alternative architectures, leaving their potential impact on parsing performance unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing that models using attention mechanisms or intermediate CTC architectures achieve higher parsing accuracy than the CTC-based textless method.

## Limitations
- Sample size for prosodic effect claims is extremely small (only 6 clear examples out of 40 collected cases)
- Architecture constraint validity is asserted but not empirically validated
- Experiments are limited to French and English, with unknown generalization to other languages

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Textless parsing underperforms cascading approach on overall UAS and LAS metrics
- Textless method shows relative advantage on sentences with clear prosodic cues
- CTC-based modeling enforces conditional independence between output tokens

**Medium Confidence**:
- Prosodic features (stress, pitch) help disambiguate syntactic structure
- Word segmentation improves prediction of long-distance dependencies
- CTC constraint is the primary bottleneck for capturing inter-token dependencies

**Low Confidence**:
- Prosodic disambiguation effect generalizes beyond the 6 clear examples
- Specific prosodic features (intensity, pitch) are reliably captured by wav2vec2
- Alternative decoding strategies would significantly improve parsing accuracy

## Next Checks

1. **Expand prosodic disambiguation validation**: Systematically collect and analyze 100+ sentences where prosodic cues could theoretically disambiguate structure. Use forced alignment to verify stress/pitch patterns and measure parsing accuracy gains specifically on these cases versus control sentences without prosodic disambiguation potential.

2. **Test CTC constraint empirically**: Implement an attention-based decoder variant of the same architecture and directly compare UAS/LAS on identical test sets. Measure performance differences specifically for dependencies longer than 3 hops and for sentences with varying prosodic content.

3. **Cross-linguistic generalization test**: Apply the textless parsing approach to a morphologically rich language (e.g., Finnish or Turkish) with available speech and dependency treebank data. Compare relative performance of textless vs. cascading approaches and analyze whether prosodic disambiguation advantages hold across different language typologies.
