# Learning Interpretable Fair Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.16698
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16698
- Reference count: 1
- Primary result: Achieves slightly higher accuracy, fairer outcomes, and more interpretable representations than LAFTR on synthetic datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning fair and interpretable representations for algorithmic fairness. While current fair representation learning methods achieve fairness, they lack interpretability, limiting their utility beyond prediction tasks. The authors propose a framework that incorporates "prior knowledge" - interpretable representations that the data owner believes are fair - into the representation learning process. Experiments on synthetic datasets (ColorMNIST and Dsprite) show that the proposed method achieves slightly higher accuracy, fairer outcomes (lower demographic parity), and more interpretable representations compared to state-of-the-art fair representation learning methods like LAFTR.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage approach for learning interpretable fair representations. First, they train an encoder to produce representations similar to interpretable "prior knowledge" using a Wasserstein GAN objective with a diversity regularization term. Then, they fine-tune the encoder to enforce fairness constraints (e.g., demographic parity) while maintaining similarity to the prior knowledge. The prior knowledge is human-provided interpretable representations (e.g., grayscale images for ColorMNIST) that the data owner believes are fair. The diversity regularization term is added to mitigate mode collapse in the GAN training. The final encoder outputs fair representations that are both interpretable and useful for prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves slightly higher accuracy than LAFTR on synthetic datasets
- Produces fairer outcomes with lower demographic parity
- Generates more interpretable representations compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Introducing "prior knowledge" as an interpretable reference point regularizes the fair representation learning process toward human-interpretable outputs. The encoder is trained via a Wasserstein GAN objective to produce representations that are similar to the interpretable prior knowledge, and then fine-tuned with fairness constraints. This two-stage approach biases the encoder toward generating representations that are both fair and interpretable. Core assumption: A human-provided interpretable representation can guide the model toward fairer outcomes without sacrificing utility. Break condition: If the prior knowledge itself contains sensitive attributes or bias, the method may amplify unfairness instead of mitigating it.

### Mechanism 2
Diversity regularization in the prior knowledge learning stage mitigates mode collapse and improves representation quality. A diversity loss term is added to the GAN objective to ensure the encoded images retain variation and avoid collapsing to a single mode, thus preserving meaningful features. Core assumption: Mode collapse in the GAN leads to trivial or non-diverse representations that fail to capture useful information. Break condition: If the diversity loss term is too strong, it may overwhelm the fairness or utility objectives, leading to noisy or unusable representations.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning the encoder with fairness constraints while maintaining similarity to the prior knowledge preserves interpretability without compromising fairness. The encoder is first trained to mimic the prior knowledge and then fine-tuned using adversarial fairness constraints (e.g., demographic parity) with a penalty for deviating from the prior knowledge. Core assumption: The encoder's parameters will not change significantly during fine-tuning, preserving the interpretable structure of the prior knowledge. Break condition: If the fairness constraints require large parameter changes, the representations may lose their interpretability or become overly distorted.

## Foundational Learning

- **Wasserstein GAN and its divergence measure**: Why needed here: The framework uses WGAN to train the encoder to match the distribution of interpretable prior knowledge, ensuring meaningful similarity. Quick check question: How does the Wasserstein distance differ from Jensen-Shannon divergence in GAN training, and why is it preferable here?

- **Demographic parity and other group fairness metrics**: Why needed here: The framework enforces demographic parity as a fairness constraint; understanding how it works is essential for adapting the method to other metrics. Quick check question: What is the mathematical definition of demographic parity, and how does it differ from equalized odds?

- **Mode collapse in generative models**: Why needed here: The diversity regularization term is introduced to address mode collapse, a known issue in GANs that can lead to trivial representations. Quick check question: What is mode collapse, and why does it pose a problem for generating diverse, interpretable representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Encoder (f) -> Discriminator (D) -> Prior knowledge set (T) -> Classifier (g) -> Adversary (h) -> Diversity loss term

- **Critical path**:
  1. Train encoder f and discriminator D using WGAN objective on prior knowledge T.
  2. Add diversity regularization to encoder f during this stage.
  3. Fine-tune encoder f with fairness constraints (e.g., LAFTR objective) while penalizing deviation from T.
  4. Evaluate fairness, accuracy, and interpretability of final representations.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Prior knowledge quality vs. fairness: Better prior knowledge may lead to more interpretable but potentially less fair representations if the prior itself is biased.
  - Diversity regularization strength vs. mode collapse: Stronger regularization may prevent collapse but could reduce fidelity to prior knowledge.
  - Encoder capacity vs. interpretability: Higher capacity encoders may generate more accurate representations but risk reduced interpretability.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Mode collapse: Encoded representations become nearly identical or trivial (e.g., all-black images).
  - Loss of fairness: Demographic parity or other fairness metrics degrade after fine-tuning.
  - Overfitting to prior knowledge: Representations are too similar to prior knowledge and lose task-specific utility.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train the encoder on synthetic ColorMNIST with prior knowledge as grayscale images; evaluate visual similarity and demographic parity.
  2. Vary the strength of the diversity regularization term; observe its effect on mode collapse and representation diversity.
  3. Replace the prior knowledge with a biased version; measure whether fairness degrades, confirming the importance of unbiased prior knowledge.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can we quantitatively measure the interpretability of fair representations? Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge the need for formal quantitative metrics for measuring interpretability, stating "we aim to survey human subjects to evaluate the representations in terms of interpretability." Why unresolved: The paper only provides qualitative assessment of interpretability through visual inspection and suggests future work to conduct surveys. What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a standardized quantitative metric for interpretability, such as a human subject study or a computational method to measure interpretability.

- **Open Question 2**: How can the framework be extended to handle tabular data with multiple correlated attributes? Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "Currently, our framework does not directly apply to tabular data since it is typically more difficult to think of how a fair representation might 'look' like, especially when the dimension of the data becomes large and multiple columns are correlated with the sensitive attributes." Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the framework on synthetic image data and acknowledges the challenge of applying it to tabular data. What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the framework to a real-world tabular dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning interpretable fair representations.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the choice of "prior knowledge" affect the quality of the learned fair representations? Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors emphasize the importance of the quality of "prior knowledge," stating "we note that the improvement of model performance and fairness level is mainly due to the high quality of our prior knowledge." Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different types or qualities of "prior knowledge" on the final representations. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different "prior knowledge" (e.g., varying quality or type) to assess their impact on the learned representations' interpretability, fairness, and accuracy.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance heavily depends on the quality and fairness of the provided "prior knowledge." If the prior knowledge contains sensitive attributes or bias, the method may amplify unfairness instead of mitigating it.
- The method is evaluated only on synthetic datasets (ColorMNIST and Dsprite), raising questions about its effectiveness on real-world data with complex correlations between sensitive attributes and outcomes.
- The framework does not directly apply to tabular data, as it is more difficult to think of how a fair representation might "look" like, especially when multiple columns are correlated with sensitive attributes.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using Wasserstein GAN to train an encoder to produce representations similar to prior knowledge is well-established and theoretically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the two-stage approach (prior knowledge learning followed by fairness fine-tuning) in achieving both fairness and interpretability is demonstrated on synthetic datasets, but real-world validation is needed.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the method to diverse real-world datasets and fairness metrics beyond demographic parity is uncertain without further empirical evidence.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework on real-world datasets (e.g., Adult Income, COMPAS) to assess its effectiveness in mitigating bias in practical scenarios and its sensitivity to the quality of prior knowledge.

2. Test the method with different types of prior knowledge (e.g., blurred, grayscale, or segmented images) to determine how prior knowledge quality affects fairness and interpretability outcomes.

3. Extend the framework to enforce other fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds, equal opportunity) and compare its performance against existing methods across multiple fairness definitions.
