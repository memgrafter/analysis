# Sibyl: Simple yet Effective Agent Framework for Complex Real-world Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10718
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10718
- Authors: Yulong Wang; Tianhao Shen; Lifeng Liu; Jian Xie
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: Achieves 34.55% average score on GAIA benchmark test set, outperforming previous methods

## Executive Summary
Sibyl is an LLM-based agent framework designed to address limitations in long-term reasoning and tool utilization for complex real-world tasks. The framework incorporates a global workspace for knowledge management, a multi-agent debate-based jury for self-refinement, and an external information acquisition channel for selective compression of data. These innovations enable Sibyl to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the GAIA benchmark, particularly excelling at challenging Level 2 and Level 3 scenarios that require extended reasoning chains.

## Method Summary
Sibyl implements three core innovations: a global workspace inspired by Global Workspace Theory that incrementally stores only relevant information increments rather than full tool outputs; a multi-agent debate-based jury based on Society of Mind Theory where Actor and Critic agents collaborate to refine answers; and an external information acquisition channel that selectively compresses tool outputs using a representation language. The system uses only two tools (web browser with human-like navigation and computer terminal with Python interpreter) to maintain simplicity while achieving superior reasoning capabilities. Evaluation was conducted on the GAIA benchmark test set using GPT-4o API with a 20-step reasoning limit.

## Key Results
- Achieves 34.55% average score on GAIA benchmark test set
- Outperforms baselines including AutoGen, FRIDAY, AutoGPT4, GPT4 Turbo, GPT4 w/ plugins, and GPT3.5
- Demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities particularly in Level 2 and Level 3 scenarios
- Shows effectiveness of selective compression in managing context for long reasoning chains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The global workspace reduces error propagation in long reasoning chains by selectively compressing historical information.
- Mechanism: Stores information in incremental state-based representation language, adding only information increments relevant to problem solving rather than appending all incoming data.
- Core assumption: Selective compression preserves critical context needed for subsequent reasoning steps while discarding noise.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions global workspace for knowledge and conversation history management; [section] describes it as a central hub ensuring cohesive problem solving.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-agent debate-based jury improves answer quality through self-correction.
- Mechanism: Multiple agents with distinct Actor and Critic roles discuss and analyze problems, with Actor proposing answers and Critic identifying logical errors.
- Core assumption: Multiple perspectives surface flaws that single agents miss.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions multi-agent debate-based jury for self-refinement; [section] describes structured interaction ensuring logical coherence.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: External information acquisition with selective compression reduces context dilution and enables longer reasoning chains.
- Mechanism: Processes tool outputs, extracts relevant information, and uses representation language to compress only incremental facts rather than entire tool results.
- Core assumption: Most tool outputs contain noise that can be filtered out while preserving information actually needed for problem solving.
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes selective compression inspired by Lee et al. (2024), integrating only pieces that directly contribute to resolving queries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dialogue state tracking from task-oriented dialogue systems
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical foundation for selectively compressing conversation history by tracking only state relevant to accomplishing tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between traditional dialogue state tracking and Sibyl's approach to compressing external information?

- Concept: Global Workspace Theory
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical basis for how information sharing should work across distributed modules in cognitive system
  - Quick check question: How does the global workspace in Sibyl differ from simply concatenating all module outputs?

- Concept: Society of Mind Theory
  - Why needed here: Informs design of multi-agent debate system where multiple semi-autonomous agents negotiate to produce coherent reasoning
  - Quick check question: What is the key insight from Society of Mind Theory that justifies using multiple agents instead of single reasoning process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Tool Planner → External Information Acquisition Channel → Global Workspace → Multi-agent Debate-based Jury → Response Formatter
- Tools: Web Browser (with human-like navigation), Computer Terminal (Python code interpreter)
- Data flows: Tool outputs → Channel compression → Global workspace storage → Jury deliberation → Final answer
- Critical path: User query → Tool planner selects tools → External information acquisition channel executes tools and compresses results → Global workspace shares compressed information → Multi-agent jury refines answers → Formatted response
- Design tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. capability (2 tools instead of many specialized ones); Stateless vs. stateful design (QA functions instead of dialogues); Selective compression vs. full context (tradeoff between information completeness and context length limits)
- Failure signatures: Tool planner fails to select appropriate tools → Dead ends in reasoning; Channel fails to compress effectively → Context limits hit quickly; Global workspace doesn't share effectively → Modules work in isolation; Jury doesn't improve answers → Wasted computation on debate
- First 3 experiments: 1) Run Sibyl on simple GAIA question (Level 1) and trace through all modules to verify information flow; 2) Remove global workspace and run same question to measure impact on answer quality; 3) Remove multi-agent jury and run same question to measure impact on answer quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does selective compression of external information impact overall performance in long-term reasoning tasks compared to traditional methods of appending information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper introduces external information acquisition channel that selectively compresses information, focusing on incremental details pertinent to solving problems, diverging from traditional appending methods.
- Why unresolved: While paper claims selective compression elevates information quality and conserves context length, it does not provide empirical comparisons or detailed analysis of how this approach specifically impacts performance metrics in long-term reasoning tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing Sibyl's performance with and without selective compression, alongside traditional methods, in terms of accuracy, context management, and reasoning efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are specific limitations of Sibyl's current browser tool in replicating human-like web interaction, and how do these limitations affect problem-solving capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges that Sibyl's browser tool is not fully functional compared to human browsers, affecting ability to interact with web content naturally and efficiently.
- Why unresolved: Paper does not detail specific functionalities lacking in Sibyl's browser tool or provide examples of how these limitations hinder problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of browser tool's current capabilities, identification of missing functionalities, and case studies illustrating impact of these limitations on problem-solving tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How could integration of vision large language models enhance Sibyl's ability to process and interpret multimedia content, and what are potential challenges in implementing this integration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions that Sibyl currently lacks integration with vision large language models, limiting ability to handle visual content effectively.
- Why unresolved: Paper does not explore potential benefits or challenges of integrating vision models, nor does it propose methods for overcoming these challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research exploring integration of vision models with Sibyl, including performance metrics, potential benefits, and solutions to implementation challenges.

## Limitations

- The evaluation uses only GPT-4o API (text only), limiting applicability to systems with multimodal capabilities
- The 20-step reasoning limit may artificially constrain performance on truly complex tasks
- The paper lacks detailed ablation studies showing individual contribution of each component
- The relatively low absolute performance (34.55%) suggests significant room for improvement on challenging tasks

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core architectural claims about three main components are well-supported by theoretical foundations and comparative performance on GAIA.

**Medium Confidence**: State-of-the-art performance claim is credible given comparison with established baselines, though low absolute performance suggests room for improvement.

**Low Confidence**: Specific mechanisms of selective compression and their effectiveness in preserving critical information while reducing context are not fully validated through controlled experiments.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Remove each component (global workspace, multi-agent jury, selective compression) individually and rerun on GAIA to quantify each component's contribution to the 34.55% score.

2. **Context Window Analysis**: Systematically vary the context window size and measure performance degradation to determine if selective compression actually solves the context limit problem or if results are still constrained by available context.

3. **Generalization Test**: Apply Sibyl to a different benchmark of complex reasoning tasks (such as HumanEval or MBPP) to assess whether the architecture's advantages transfer beyond the GAIA domain.
