# Large Language Models for Disease Diagnosis: A Scoping Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.00097
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00097
- Reference count: 40
- First comprehensive analysis of LLMs in disease diagnosis, examining 398 papers across 19 clinical specialties

## Executive Summary
This scoping review provides the first comprehensive analysis of large language models (LLMs) in disease diagnosis, systematically examining 398 papers to identify key disease types, clinical data, LLM techniques, and evaluation methods. The study reveals that text-based and multimodal LLMs are widely applied across 19 clinical specialties, with prompting and fine-tuning being the most common techniques. Findings highlight strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering recommendations for data preparation and evaluation, while identifying critical challenges including data availability, ethical considerations, and the need for standardized benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic scoping review following PRISMA guidelines, screening 7,846 papers from six databases and 1,073 preprints from arXiv and medRxiv. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 398 papers were analyzed, focusing on disease diagnosis tasks using LLMs. Data extraction covered disease types, clinical data sources, LLM techniques, evaluation methods, and reported performance metrics. The review synthesized findings across multiple clinical specialties and LLM implementation approaches.

## Key Results
- Text-based and multimodal LLMs are widely applied across 19 clinical specialties for disease diagnosis
- Prompting and fine-tuning are the most common LLM techniques, with prompting excelling in stepwise reasoning and fine-tuning providing higher accuracy for complex tasks
- The review identifies critical challenges including data availability, ethical considerations, and the need for standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) improves diagnostic accuracy by enabling stepwise reasoning
- Mechanism: The LLM decomposes complex clinical problems into intermediate reasoning steps, generating coherent outputs that align with diagnostic workflows
- Core assumption: Sequential reasoning paths mimic clinician decision-making and reduce reasoning errors
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "CoT prompting excels in thoroughly digesting input clinical cues in manageable steps to make a coherent diagnosis decision"; [section] "Particularly, in differential diagnosis tasks, CoT reasoning allows the LLM to sequentially analyze medical images, radiology reports, and clinical history, generating intermediate outputs that lead to a holistic decision, with an accuracy of 64%."
- Break condition: If the clinical task lacks intermediate logical steps (e.g., pure classification without reasoning), CoT offers no advantage

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces hallucination by grounding responses in external, curated knowledge
- Mechanism: During inference, the LLM retrieves relevant medical knowledge and integrates it into the response, improving factual accuracy and reducing unsupported claims
- Core assumption: External knowledge sources are accurate, up-to-date, and well-matched to the clinical context
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "To enhance the accuracy and credibility of the diagnosis, alleviate hallucination issues, and update LLMs' stored medical knowledge without needing re-training, recent studies have incorporated external medical knowledge into diagnostic tasks"; [section] "Li et al. developed guideline-based GPT agents for retrieving and summarizing content related to diagnosing traumatic brain injury. They found that these guideline-based GPT-4 agents significantly outperformed the off-the-shelf GPT-4 in terms of accuracy, explainability, and empathy evaluation."
- Break condition: If the knowledge base is incomplete, outdated, or poorly indexed, retrieval may introduce irrelevant or misleading information

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-training on large-scale medical corpora enhances generalization and robustness across diverse diagnostic tasks
- Mechanism: Unsupervised language modeling on extensive clinical and biomedical text allows the model to learn domain-specific patterns, semantics, and context before task-specific fine-tuning
- Core assumption: The pre-training corpus is sufficiently large, diverse, and representative of real-world clinical language
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Pre-training medical LLMs involves training on large-scale, unlabeled medical corpora to develop a comprehensive understanding of the structure, semantics, and context of medical language"; [section] "This phenomenon aligns with another observation that over half of pre-training models used data from multiple specialties."
- Break condition: If the pre-training data is narrow in scope or contains biased or noisy content, the resulting model may fail to generalize or introduce systematic errors

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: Enables the LLM to emulate clinician-like diagnostic reasoning, improving accuracy for tasks requiring intermediate logical steps
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a multi-step diagnostic decision (e.g., differential diagnosis) would be broken down using CoT?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  - Why needed here: Grounds LLM responses in verified external medical knowledge, reducing hallucination and improving factual reliability
  - Quick check question: What are the risks if the retrieval index contains outdated or irrelevant medical guidelines?

- Concept: Multi-modal data integration
  - Why needed here: Real-world diagnosis often relies on combining text, imaging, and other data; multimodal LLMs better reflect this complexity
  - Quick check question: How would you structure a prompt that combines a chest X-ray and clinical notes for differential diagnosis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (clinical data) → Prompting module (hard prompts) → RAG module (external knowledge + retrieval) → Fine-tuning module (SFT + RLHF) → Pre-training module (large-scale medical corpus) → Evaluation (metrics + expert review) → Output (diagnostic prediction + explanation)

- Critical path: Input → Prompt/RAG/Fine-tuning/Pre-training → Output → Evaluation
  - For rapid prototyping, start with prompt engineering; for high accuracy, move to fine-tuning or pre-training

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. resource constraints: Prompting requires minimal data but may underperform complex tasks; fine-tuning/pre-training yield higher accuracy but demand large, annotated datasets and computational resources
  - Interpretability vs. performance: Soft prompts and RAG improve explainability but may sacrifice some raw accuracy
  - Generalization vs. specialization: Pre-training on diverse data improves robustness; fine-tuning on narrow tasks improves task-specific performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy: Insufficient or poor-quality data; inappropriate LLM technique for task complexity
  - Hallucinations: Missing or weak RAG grounding; over-reliance on prompting without external validation
  - Poor generalization: Narrow pre-training corpus; lack of multi-specialty data
  - High cost/complexity: Overuse of fine-tuning/pre-training when simple prompting suffices

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Zero-shot prompting on a small clinical vignette dataset; measure accuracy and reasoning quality
  2. RAG with a curated guideline corpus on the same dataset; compare hallucination rates and factual accuracy
  3. Fine-tuning on a labeled subset of the dataset; evaluate performance gains and resource requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evidence base for specific LLM mechanisms (CoT, RAG, pre-training) remains weak, with related citations often lacking direct experimental validation
- The review relies heavily on aggregated findings across diverse clinical specialties, which may mask context-specific performance variations
- Systematic assessment of evaluation methods is limited by heterogeneity of reported metrics and lack of standardized benchmarks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Prevalence of text-based and multimodal LLMs, dominance of prompting and fine-tuning techniques
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanisms of CoT reasoning, RAG grounding, and pre-training generalization (plausible but not robustly validated)
- **Low confidence**: Specific quantitative claims (e.g., "accuracy of 64%" for CoT) not substantiated by direct experimental data

## Next Checks
1. Direct experimental validation: Conduct head-to-head comparisons of CoT, RAG, and standard prompting on a standardized diagnostic dataset
2. Benchmark standardization: Develop and apply a unified evaluation framework across multiple clinical specialties
3. Real-world integration assessment: Pilot LLM diagnostic tools in clinical setting with active clinician oversight
