# Teacher agency in the age of generative AI: towards a framework of hybrid intelligence for learning design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06655
- Authors: Thomas B Frøsig; Margarida Romero
- Reference count: 0
- The paper proposes a hybrid intelligence framework to preserve teacher agency in learning design while leveraging generative AI capabilities.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines how generative AI (genAI) impacts teacher agency in learning design, identifying that current genAI tools risk diminishing teachers' professional agency by limiting their power to act, affect matters, make decisions, and take stances. Drawing on Vähäsantanen's framework, the authors analyze four dimensions of teacher agency and propose a hybrid intelligence approach that combines human and artificial intelligence to preserve teacher autonomy while enhancing learning design processes. The framework aims to transform teaching practices by enabling teachers to move from passive users to active co-creators in educational technology design.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a qualitative analysis of generative AI's influence on teacher agency using Vähäsantanen's four-dimensional framework, followed by a proposal for a hybrid intelligence solution. The method involves reviewing existing literature on teacher agency frameworks, analyzing current genAI tools in education to identify impacts on agency dimensions, and developing a conceptual framework for hybrid intelligence that preserves teacher agency while leveraging AI capabilities.

## Key Results
- Current genAI tools often restrict teacher influence due to their autonomous nature, limiting power to act, affect matters, make decisions, and take stances
- Hybrid intelligence combines human and artificial intelligence through collaborative design, allowing teachers to retain control over decision-making and influence over AI outputs
- Trust in AI requires teachers to exercise professional agency during AI integration, enabling them to mitigate misconceptions and build pragmatic trust

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid Intelligence preserves teacher agency by enabling active decision-making rather than passive output reception.
- Mechanism: HI combines human and artificial intelligence through collaborative design, allowing teachers to retain control over decision-making, stance-taking, and influence over AI outputs.
- Core assumption: Teachers' agency is preserved when they remain active participants in the AI-human interaction loop rather than receiving autonomous outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This combination opens up the discussion of a collaboration between teacher and genAI being able to open up new practices in learning design in which they HI support the extension of the teachers' activity."
  - [section] "Such a system would be able to support teachers' learning design, without decreasing their agency. Mishra and colleagues (2023) summarises this notion in the process of moving teachers from just users or operators to co-creators, shaping, and being shaped by these technologies."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for this specific HI mechanism
- Break condition: If the system design defaults to fully autonomous generation without human input checkpoints.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Teacher agency depends on having power to act, affect matters, make decisions, and take stances.
- Mechanism: When teachers can influence both the technology design and its application, they maintain professional agency across all four dimensions.
- Core assumption: Professional agency requires active participation in both the design and use of educational technology.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "professional agency, and specifically teacher agency, is a multidisciplinary concept covering four different subdisciplines, including (i) the social science traditions, (ii) the post-structural tradition, (iii) the socio-cultural approaches, and (iv) the identity and live-course approach (Eteläpelto et al., 2013, p.17). In their review of these different traditions, Eteläpelto and colleagues sustain that 'professional agency is practiced when professional subjects and/or communities exert influence, make choices, and take stances in ways that affect their work and/or their professional identities' (Eteläpelto et al., 2013, p.17). In a qualitative meta-study investigating teacher agency within Finish Vocational Training, Vähäsantan (2015) sums up teacher agency as teachers having (i) the power to act, (ii) the power to affect matters, (iii) the power to make decisions and choices, and (iv) the power to take a stance."
  - [abstract] "While GenAI can support certain processes of idea generation and co-creation, GenAI has the potential to negatively affect professional agency due to teachers' limited power to (i) act, (ii) affect matters, and (iii) make decisions or choices, as well as the possibility to (iv) take a stance."
- Break condition: If the technology design removes any of these four powers from teacher control.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Trust in AI requires teachers to exercise professional agency during AI integration.
- Mechanism: When teachers actively engage with AI systems rather than passively accepting outputs, they can mitigate misconceptions and build pragmatic trust.
- Core assumption: Professional agency during AI integration enables teachers to develop realistic expectations and trust.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Teacher's agency is known to be a key when trusting AI in education (Nazaretsky et al., 2022). The ability to exercise professional agency during AI integration enables teachers to mitigate misconceptions and false expectations about AI. This, in turn, promotes a more pragmatic and trustful approach to incorporating AI into specific teaching and learning activities, ultimately adding value from a human-centred perspective (Romero et al., 2024)."
  - [corpus] Weak - while trust is mentioned, specific mechanisms for how agency builds trust are not detailed in corpus
- Break condition: If the system design creates unrealistic expectations through unexplained autonomous outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hybrid Intelligence (HI)
  - Why needed here: Understanding HI is essential because it forms the core solution proposed for preserving teacher agency while leveraging AI capabilities.
  - Quick check question: How does Hybrid Intelligence differ from traditional AI systems in terms of teacher involvement?

- Concept: Teacher Professional Agency
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly identifies four dimensions of teacher agency that must be preserved in any AI-integrated learning design.
  - Quick check question: What are the four components of teacher professional agency according to Vähäsantanen's framework?

- Concept: Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)
  - Why needed here: The paper references TPACK as a foundational framework that needs to be augmented to consider teacher agency in AI contexts.
  - Quick check question: How does the extension of TPACK with contextual knowledge (XK) shift teacher roles from designers to innovation managers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Teacher Interface Layer -> AI Collaboration Engine -> Agency Monitoring System -> Feedback Loop -> Teacher Interface Layer

- Critical path:
  1. Teacher initiates learning design activity
  2. System presents collaborative options respecting all four agency dimensions
  3. Teacher makes decisions and takes stances
  4. AI generates outputs based on teacher inputs
  5. Teacher reviews and provides feedback
  6. System learns and adjusts for future collaborations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Autonomy vs. Control: Higher teacher control preserves agency but may reduce efficiency
  - Complexity vs. Usability: More sophisticated collaboration features may increase learning curve
  - Transparency vs. Performance: Explainable AI may sacrifice some generation capabilities

- Failure signatures:
  - Teachers report feeling like passive recipients of AI suggestions
  - System defaults to autonomous generation without teacher input checkpoints
  - Teachers cannot trace or influence how AI generates specific outputs
  - Decision-making power is concentrated in AI rather than distributed between human and machine

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test teacher ability to influence AI output generation through adjustable parameters
  2. Measure teacher satisfaction with agency preservation across different collaboration modes
  3. Compare learning design quality when teachers use traditional tools vs. HI-enhanced tools

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific design features would enable hybrid intelligence systems to maintain teacher agency while leveraging generative AI capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose hybrid intelligence as a solution but don't specify concrete design features
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for hybrid intelligence but only provides a conceptual framework without detailing implementation requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies testing different hybrid intelligence system designs and their impact on teacher agency metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does teacher agency differ when using generative AI for learning design versus other educational technology tools?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that educational technology typically prioritizes learner agency, but doesn't empirically compare generative AI's unique impact
- Why unresolved: The authors identify this as a research gap but haven't conducted comparative studies across different educational technology types
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies measuring teacher agency across various educational technology implementations

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal conditions for maintaining teacher agency when using generative AI in different educational contexts (e.g., subject areas, grade levels, cultural settings)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention contextual knowledge (XK) but don't explore how different contexts affect teacher agency with generative AI
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges context as important but doesn't investigate how specific educational contexts influence the agency-technology relationship
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-contextual comparative studies examining teacher agency outcomes across diverse educational settings using generative AI

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide concrete examples of how current genAI tools fail to preserve teacher agency across all four dimensions
- Implementation specifics for the hybrid intelligence framework are not detailed
- The impact on different educational contexts (K-12 vs. higher education) is not addressed

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The theoretical framework for teacher agency (four dimensions) and its importance in AI integration
- Medium Confidence: The hybrid intelligence solution as a mechanism for preserving teacher agency
- Low Confidence: The practical impact of current genAI tools on teacher agency across all four dimensions

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Agency Assessment**: Conduct case studies with teachers using current genAI tools to measure agency preservation across the four dimensions (power to act, affect matters, make decisions, take stances).

2. **Hybrid Intelligence Prototype Testing**: Develop and test a prototype hybrid intelligence system with teachers to evaluate whether it successfully preserves agency while enhancing learning design capabilities.

3. **Cross-Context Validation**: Test the framework across different educational levels and subjects to identify contextual variations in how hybrid intelligence affects teacher agency.
