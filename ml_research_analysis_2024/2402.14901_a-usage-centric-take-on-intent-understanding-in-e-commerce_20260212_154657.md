# A Usage-centric Take on Intent Understanding in E-Commerce

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14901
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14901

- Primary result: Identifies property-ambiguity and category-rigidity as key weaknesses in FolkScope knowledge graph, proposing a usage-centric paradigm for intent understanding in e-commerce

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical limitations in intent understanding for e-commerce by analyzing the FolkScope knowledge graph. The authors identify two key weaknesses: property-ambiguity (user intents poorly aligned with product properties) and category-rigidity (intents strongly tied to single product categories). They propose a usage-centric paradigm where intents are viewed as activities or situations, and products are grouped into "kinds" based on category and property. A Product Recovery Benchmark is introduced to evaluate intent understanding methods while isolating confounding factors like price or ratings.

## Method Summary
The authors refactor the FolkScope KG to align with a usage-centric intent understanding paradigm, then build a Product Recovery Benchmark using the Amazon Reviews Dataset. They evaluate FolkScope's performance on bought-product-recovery and co-bought-product-recovery tasks, measuring mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of gold kinds of products in predicted distributions. The study compares FolkScope against baselines including a property-ambiguity baseline and LLM reranking approaches using GPT-3.5-turbo. The methodology isolates confounding factors like price and ratings to focus specifically on intent understanding capabilities.

## Key Results
- FolkScope exhibits property-ambiguity, mapping user intents to products with relevant categories but fairly random properties
- Category-rigidity limits FolkScope's ability to recommend diverse products across categories that serve common intents
- LLM reranking improves predictions but is computationally expensive and faces dataset artifact issues
- Usage-centric paradigm shows promise but requires further validation across diverse e-commerce contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Property-ambiguity limits the ability of intent knowledge graphs to recommend products with the most desirable properties.
- Mechanism: The KG's edge weights among differently-propertied kinds of products within the same category are strongly predicted by their prior distribution, and are insensitive to the specific usages depicted by user intents.
- Core assumption: User intents should influence the edge weights between intents and kinds of products with specific properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "property-ambiguity: generated user intents are poorly aligned with relevant product properties, such that the KG often maps user intents to kinds of products with relevant category but fairly random properties"
  - [section 3.2] "For up to 20% of cases, JSD is < 0.1, where only 2% of cases have JSD > 0.5"
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.498, average citations=0.0."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Category-rigidity limits the ability of intent knowledge graphs to recommend diverse products across different categories that serve common intents.
- Mechanism: Each intent is strongly associated with a single category of product, limiting the KG's ability to recommend diverse products across different categories.
- Core assumption: User intents can be served by products from multiple categories.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "category-rigidity: each intent is strongly associated with a single category of product, such that the KG is unable to recommend diverse products across diverse categories that serve common intents"
  - [section 3.2] "entropy values are concentrated in 2 narrow ranges, [0, 0.02) and [0.68, 0.70)"
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.498, average citations=0.0."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Usage-centric intent understanding improves product recommendation by focusing on natural language predicative phrases and kinds of products.
- Mechanism: By defining user intents as activities to accomplish or situations to resolve, and kinds of products as clusters of product listings possessing the same category and property, the task becomes a natural language reasoning task independent of product ontologies.
- Core assumption: User intents can be expressed as natural language predicative phrases, and products can be grouped into kinds based on category and property.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we focus on predicative user intents as 'how a customer uses a product', and pose intent understanding as a natural language reasoning task, independent of product ontologies"
  - [section 2] "In this paradigm, user intents are focused on natural language predicative phrases, i.e. how users use a product; also, instead of individual product listings, we aim to predict kinds of products useful for an intent"
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.498, average citations=0.0."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)
  - Why needed here: To measure the similarity between the edge weight distributions conditioned on intents and the prior distributions across differently-propertied kinds of products within a category.
  - Quick check question: What does a low JSD value indicate about the relationship between the conditional and prior distributions?

- Concept: Entropy
  - Why needed here: To measure the category diversity of edge weights for each user intent, indicating how diverse the product categories are for that intent.
  - Quick check question: What does a low entropy value indicate about the category diversity of an intent?

- Concept: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
  - Why needed here: To evaluate the success of predicting kinds of products based on retrieved user intents, by measuring the reciprocal rank of gold kinds of products in the predicted distributions.
  - Quick check question: How is MRR calculated when there are multiple gold kinds of products for a product listing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  FolkScope KG -> Product Recovery Benchmark -> LLM Rerank/GPT End-to-End

- Critical path:
  1. Refactor FolkScope KG based on the usage-centric intent understanding paradigm.
  2. Build the Product Recovery Benchmark using the Amazon Reviews Dataset.
  3. Evaluate FolkScope KG and LLM baselines on the benchmark.
  4. Analyze the results to identify weaknesses and potential improvements.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using FolkScope KG provides a large-scale, pre-existing knowledge graph but may have limitations in property alignment and category diversity.
  - Using LLMs for re-ranking or end-to-end prediction offers flexibility but may be computationally expensive and less reliable for exact matching.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low MRR values indicate poor performance in predicting kinds of products based on user intents.
  - High JSD values suggest that edge weight distributions are not well-aligned with the specific usages depicted by user intents.
  - Low entropy values indicate that intents are strongly associated with a single category of product.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate FolkScope KG on the bought-product-recovery task and compare the results with and without property substitution.
  2. Evaluate FolkScope KG on the co-bought-product-recovery task to validate the category-rigidity observation.
  3. Implement and evaluate the LLM re-ranking paradigm using GPT-3.5-turbo to improve predictions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the property-ambiguity issue in FolkScope be effectively resolved using user reviews?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper hypothesizes that user reviews could help resolve property-ambiguity by co-occurring desired product properties with their respective intents.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence to support this hypothesis and leaves it as a promising direction for future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to demonstrate that incorporating user reviews into the intent understanding process improves the alignment between user intents and product properties, thereby reducing property-ambiguity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the category-rigidity issue in FolkScope be alleviated by leveraging user reviews across different product categories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that user reviews could help relieve category-rigidity by describing the same usage intents consistently across different categories.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence to support this hypothesis and leaves it as a promising direction for future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to demonstrate that incorporating user reviews into the intent understanding process improves the diversity of product categories associated with each user intent, thereby reducing category-rigidity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of dataset artifacts on the performance of intent understanding methods in the product recovery benchmark?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that dataset artifacts from the common source corpus (AWD) could be behind the abnormally high hit-at-1 rate observed in the LLM reranking experiment.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the extent of dataset artifacts' impact on the benchmark and leaves further investigations for future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to quantify the impact of dataset artifacts on the performance of various intent understanding methods in the product recovery benchmark, and developing strategies to mitigate their effects.

## Limitations

- Property-ambiguity and category-rigidity observations are based on a single knowledge graph (FolkScope), limiting generalizability across different intent understanding approaches
- Usage-centric paradigm's effectiveness in real-world e-commerce scenarios remains unproven, as experiments focus on controlled benchmark tasks
- Product Recovery Benchmark may not capture all practical challenges of intent understanding, particularly for complex or ambiguous user queries

## Confidence

- High confidence: The identification of property-ambiguity and category-rigidity as limitations in FolkScope KG is well-supported by empirical evidence
- Medium confidence: The usage-centric paradigm offers a promising theoretical framework, but requires more extensive validation across diverse e-commerce contexts
- Medium confidence: The Product Recovery Benchmark provides a useful evaluation framework, though its comprehensiveness could be improved

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the usage-centric paradigm on additional knowledge graphs and intent understanding systems to assess generalizability of the findings
2. Implement a user study to validate whether the usage-centric approach aligns with actual customer behavior and intent expression patterns
3. Extend the Product Recovery Benchmark to include more diverse intent types and product categories, particularly those with complex multi-category relationships
