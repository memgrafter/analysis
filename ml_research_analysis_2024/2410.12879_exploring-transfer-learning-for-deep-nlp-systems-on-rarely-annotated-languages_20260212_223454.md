- One-line primary result: Jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings outperform monolingual and vector-mapped embeddings for POS tagging

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates transfer learning for Part-of-Speech tagging between Hindi and Nepali, two highly similar Indo-Aryan languages. Using the BLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture, the study evaluates monolingual embeddings, cross-lingual vector-mapped embeddings, and jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings under varying dropout rates and optimizers. Experiments on POS tagging, multitask learning in Hindi, and transfer learning between Hindi and Nepali show that jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings yield the best performance across all models, outperforming monolingual and vector-mapped embeddings.

## Method Summary
The study uses the BLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture with Hindi and Nepali POS-tagged datasets. Models are trained using monolingual FastText embeddings, cross-lingual mapped embeddings (via Artetxe et al. method), and jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings. Training is performed with varying dropout rates (0.25-0.5) and optimizers (Adam, AdaDelta). Multitask learning is explored by adding gender and singularity/plural tagging tasks. Transfer learning is evaluated through joint training on both languages.

## Key Results
- Jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings yield the best POS tagging performance across all models
- Default setup (dropout 0.25, Adam optimizer) achieves optimal performance for POS tagging
- Multitask learning with auxiliary gender and singularity/plural tagging tasks does not improve POS tagging accuracy in Hindi
- Transfer learning does not significantly enhance POS tagging performance in either language

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings improve POS tagging performance over monolingual embeddings.
- Mechanism: Training embeddings on a combined corpus allows the model to learn shared semantic and syntactic representations that benefit both languages due to their high linguistic similarity.
- Core assumption: Hindi and Nepali share enough lexical and structural similarity that a joint embedding space captures beneficial cross-lingual patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings yield the best performance across all models, outperforming monolingual and vector-mapped embeddings."
  - [section] "the vector for a word is created on the basis of the words in its surrounding in that particular language...Hence when the embeddings are mapped between two languages the vector space orientation is shifted which seems to be detrimental to the performance of the model."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus only shows related work, no direct evidence of embedding performance.
- Break condition: If the languages diverge significantly in vocabulary or syntax, the joint embedding may introduce noise and hurt performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The default BLSTM-CNN-CRF setup (dropout 0.25, Adam optimizer) achieves optimal performance.
- Mechanism: This configuration balances model capacity and regularization, preventing overfitting while maintaining sufficient learning speed.
- Core assumption: The hyperparameters chosen by Reimers et al. generalize well to Hindi and Nepali POS tagging tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The default setup derived from Reimers et. al [1] seems to help the model in its task of POS tagging."
  - [section] "default setup which is inspired from the work of Reimers et. al [1] seems to achieve the highest accuracy in case of individual POS tagging in Hindi, Nepali, and Multitasking in Hindi"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence directly supports this specific claim.
- Break condition: If the dataset size or noise level differs substantially from the original setup, these hyperparameters may no longer be optimal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transfer learning between Hindi and Nepali does not significantly improve POS tagging performance.
- Mechanism: The BLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture cannot effectively exploit the linguistic similarity between the languages for this task, possibly due to differences in dataset quality or task-specific features.
- Core assumption: The architectural capacity and training regime are insufficient to leverage cross-lingual transfer benefits for POS tagging.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Transfer learning does not significantly enhance POS tagging performance in either language, with slightly lower accuracy compared to monolingual models."
  - [section] "transfer learning or training the model jointly on similar tasks in two domains doesn't seem to help the model's performance as much...One of the possible reasons could be that as the performance of the model was not so good on Hindi dataset, it led to the overall poor performance of the model."
  - [corpus] Weak - related work shows transfer learning is explored but not conclusively effective for this pair.
- Break condition: If a different architecture or training strategy is used, transfer learning might become beneficial.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word embeddings and their role in capturing semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: Embeddings are the input representation; their quality directly impacts POS tagging accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Why might jointly trained embeddings outperform monolingual ones for closely related languages?

- Concept: BLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture components and data flow
  - Why needed here: Understanding how each module (CNN for character features, BLSTM for context, CRF for sequence labeling) contributes is essential for debugging and improvement.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the CRF layer in sequence labeling tasks?

- Concept: Transfer learning paradigms (multitask vs sequential vs cross-lingual)
  - Why needed here: The thesis compares these approaches; knowing their differences explains the results.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-lingual transfer differ from multitask learning in terms of data and objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Character embeddings → CNN (extract morphological features) → Concat with word embeddings → BLSTM (contextual encoding) → CRF (sequence labeling)
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Embedding generation → Model training (with early stopping) → Evaluation on test set
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Joint embeddings vs monolingual: better cross-lingual generalization vs language-specific nuance
  - Shared vs separate BLSTM layers: parameter efficiency vs task specialization
  - Dropout rate: regularization vs underfitting risk
- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy: poor embeddings, insufficient training data, or suboptimal hyperparameters
  - Overfitting: high train accuracy but low test accuracy, suggesting need for stronger regularization or more data
  - Slow convergence: learning rate too low or architecture too deep
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train POS tagging model on Hindi using default setup and monolingual embeddings; evaluate accuracy.
  2. Train POS tagging model on Nepali using default setup and monolingual embeddings; evaluate accuracy.
  3. Train joint Hindi-Nepali embeddings and use them to train POS tagging on both languages; compare performance to step 1 and 2.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would replacing the BLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture with a more advanced model like BERT or GPT-2 improve the performance of POS tagging for Hindi and Nepali?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes with a suggestion to explore other architectures beyond BLSTM-CNN-CRF, implying potential for improvement.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested the BLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture and did not experiment with other models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using BERT, GPT-2, or other advanced models on the same datasets and tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would supervised or semi-supervised cross-lingual embeddings compare to the unsupervised method used in this study for POS tagging performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the unsupervised cross-lingual mapping method did not improve performance and suggests exploring other methods.
- Why unresolved: Only unsupervised cross-lingual mapping was tested, leaving other methods unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using supervised or semi-supervised cross-lingual embeddings with the same tasks and datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would adjusting the learning rate of the AdaDelta optimizer improve its performance compared to the Adam optimizer in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that AdaDelta did not improve performance and suggests that its convergence rate depends on the initial learning rate.
- Why unresolved: The study used a fixed learning rate for AdaDelta without exploring different values.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with varying learning rates for AdaDelta across the same tasks and datasets.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Would sequential transfer learning be more effective than the cross-lingual transfer learning approach used in this study for POS tagging between Hindi and Nepali?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes by suggesting that other transfer learning architectures like sequential transfer learning could be explored.
- Why unresolved: Only cross-lingual transfer learning was tested, not sequential transfer learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing sequential transfer learning with the cross-lingual approach on the same tasks and datasets.

## Limitations
- Study focuses on only one language pair (Hindi-Nepali) despite broader claims about applicability
- Relatively small dataset sizes for Hindi and Nepali POS tagging may limit generalizability
- Lack of ablation studies isolating the impact of each architectural component
- Performance degradation with cross-lingual mapped embeddings may be dataset-specific

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The finding that jointly trained Hindi-Nepali embeddings outperform monolingual embeddings for this language pair
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that default hyperparameters (dropout 0.25, Adam) work best
- **Low Confidence**: The conclusion that transfer learning does not help POS tagging

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the monolingual Hindi POS tagging experiments on the same dataset splits to verify the reported accuracy baseline before testing transfer learning.
2. Train separate models using only CNN, only BLSTM, and only CRF components to quantify each module's contribution to the final performance.
3. Implement a sequential fine-tuning approach where the model is first trained on Hindi then fine-tuned on Nepali to test if transfer direction affects outcomes.
