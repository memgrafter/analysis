# Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.07166
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a benchmark framework to evaluate LLMs for embodied decision-making using linear temporal logic and standardized modules

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Embodied Agent Interface (EAI), a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating large language models in embodied decision-making tasks. The framework standardizes the interface between LLMs and embodied agents using linear temporal logic (LTL) to represent goals and tasks. It unifies four key LLM-based modules: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling. The benchmark provides fine-grained metrics to analyze different types of errors including hallucination, affordance, and planning errors.

The authors evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs across two simulators, revealing that while models like o1-preview and Claude-3.5 Sonnet show strong performance, most LLMs struggle with precise goal grounding and reasoning about preconditions. The results highlight significant opportunities for improvement in leveraging LLMs for embodied agents and provide a standardized methodology for future research in this domain.

## Method Summary
The Embodied Agent Interface framework introduces a standardized approach for evaluating LLMs in embodied decision-making by using linear temporal logic to represent goals and tasks. The framework unifies four key LLM-based modules: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling. This standardization enables consistent evaluation across different models and environments.

The benchmark employs fine-grained metrics to analyze various error types including hallucination errors (generating invalid or contradictory information), affordance errors (failing to recognize valid object interactions), and planning errors (incorrect sequence of actions). The framework is tested across two different simulators to assess model performance in varied embodied environments. The evaluation methodology focuses on both task completion success rates and the quality of reasoning demonstrated by the LLMs.

## Key Results
- o1-preview and Claude-3.5 Sonnet achieve the highest performance among tested models, but still struggle with precise goal grounding
- Most LLMs demonstrate significant difficulties with reasoning about preconditions and object affordances in embodied environments
- Fine-grained error analysis reveals that hallucination and planning errors are the most common failure modes across all evaluated models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a standardized interface that translates natural language goals into executable plans through a pipeline of LLM-based modules. Linear temporal logic serves as a formal representation that bridges natural language understanding with precise task specification. Each module handles a specific aspect of the decision-making process: interpreting goals, breaking them into manageable subgoals, sequencing actions appropriately, and modeling state transitions. This modular approach allows for targeted evaluation of different reasoning capabilities while maintaining consistency across experiments.

## Foundational Learning

**Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)**: A formal system for specifying properties of reactive systems over time, needed to precisely represent goals and constraints in dynamic environments. Quick check: Can you express "eventually reach the kitchen" or "always avoid fire" using LTL operators?

**Embodied Decision Making**: The process of making sequential decisions in physical or simulated environments where actions have direct consequences on the agent's state. Quick check: Does the agent need to consider both immediate rewards and long-term consequences?

**Modular LLM Architecture**: Breaking down complex reasoning tasks into specialized submodules (goal interpretation, planning, action sequencing) to improve interpretability and performance. Quick check: How does separating these functions affect error diagnosis and system debugging?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Natural Language Goal -> LTL Goal Specification -> Subgoal Decomposition -> Action Sequencing -> Transition Modeling -> Execution

**Critical Path**: The pipeline follows a sequential flow where each module's output serves as input to the next: goal interpretation produces formal specifications, which are decomposed into subgoals, sequenced into action plans, and validated through transition modeling before execution.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The modular approach enables fine-grained error analysis but introduces potential compounding errors across modules. Using LTL provides precision but may limit natural language flexibility. The framework prioritizes interpretability and standardization over end-to-end optimization.

**Failure Signatures**: Hallucination errors manifest as invalid object references or impossible actions; affordance errors occur when models fail to recognize valid interactions; planning errors appear as incorrect action sequences or missed preconditions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test single module performance isolation by feeding pre-processed LTL specifications to the planning module
2. Evaluate end-to-end performance on simple, well-defined tasks before progressing to complex scenarios
3. Compare performance across different LLM families (reasoning-focused vs. general-purpose) on identical tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on two specific simulators, which may limit generalizability to other embodied environments
- Text-based interaction excludes multimodal inputs that could provide richer state representations
- Does not address real-world constraints like sensor noise or partial observability

## Confidence

- High confidence: Current LLMs struggle with precise goal grounding and precondition reasoning, supported by consistent performance patterns
- Medium confidence: Comparative performance rankings of different LLMs, as results may be influenced by simulator-specific factors
- Low confidence: Generalizability of fine-grained error analysis metrics, as they were developed for controlled benchmark scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test the benchmark across multiple embodied agent frameworks and simulators to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate model performance with multimodal inputs (visual, audio) to determine if richer state representations improve reasoning
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual LLM modules on overall system performance
