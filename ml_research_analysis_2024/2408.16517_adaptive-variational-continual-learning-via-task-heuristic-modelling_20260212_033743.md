# Adaptive Variational Continual Learning via Task-Heuristic Modelling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.16517
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16517
- Authors: Fan Yang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: AutoVCL adjusts KL divergence weight dynamically based on task heuristics, achieving 97.2%, 90.9%, and 84.9% accuracy on Split MNIST, Permuted MNIST, and mixed MNIST-CIFAR-10 after 10 tasks, outperforming fixed-β GVCL variants.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces AutoVCL, an adaptive extension of Variational Continual Learning (VCL) that automatically adjusts the KL divergence weight (β) during training based on task heuristics. The model quantifies task difficulty and similarity to dynamically set β, balancing between preserving previous knowledge and learning new tasks. Evaluated on Split MNIST with custom targets, Permuted MNIST, and a mixed MNIST-CIFAR-10 dataset, AutoVCL consistently outperformed fixed-β GVCL variants. After 10 tasks, AutoVCL achieved 97.2%, 90.9%, and 84.9% accuracy respectively, compared to best fixed-β GVCL results of 96.7%, 89.9%, and 84.0%. The adaptive β adjustment allowed AutoVCL to excel across varying task sequences without manual hyperparameter tuning.

## Method Summary
AutoVCL extends Variational Continual Learning by introducing an adaptive mechanism for adjusting the KL divergence weight (β) during training. The model evaluates task difficulty and similarity to previous tasks using predefined heuristics, which are then used to dynamically set β. This approach allows the model to balance between preserving knowledge from previous tasks and learning new tasks effectively. The adaptive β adjustment is achieved through a combination of task-specific metrics, enabling AutoVCL to perform well across varying task sequences without the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Results
- AutoVCL achieved 97.2% accuracy on Split MNIST after 10 tasks, outperforming the best fixed-β GVCL result of 96.7%.
- On Permuted MNIST, AutoVCL reached 90.9% accuracy, compared to 89.9% for the best fixed-β GVCL variant.
- In a mixed MNIST-CIFAR-10 dataset, AutoVCL attained 84.9% accuracy, surpassing the 84.0% achieved by the best fixed-β GVCL model.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AutoVCL's adaptive β adjustment mechanism allows the model to dynamically balance the trade-off between preserving previous knowledge and learning new tasks. By quantifying task difficulty and similarity using heuristics, the model can set β to an optimal value for each task, avoiding the pitfalls of fixed-β approaches. This adaptability enables AutoVCL to maintain high performance across diverse task sequences, as it can adjust its learning strategy based on the characteristics of each new task. The heuristic-based approach ensures that the model remains flexible and robust, even when faced with varying task complexities and similarities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Variational Continual Learning (VCL)**: A framework for continual learning that uses variational inference to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Why needed: Provides the base architecture for AutoVCL, allowing it to leverage probabilistic modeling for knowledge retention.
- **KL Divergence Weight (β)**: A hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between fitting new data and preserving old knowledge. Why needed: Adjusting β dynamically is crucial for balancing learning and forgetting in continual learning scenarios.
- **Task Heuristics**: Predefined metrics for evaluating task difficulty and similarity. Why needed: These heuristics guide the adaptive adjustment of β, ensuring optimal performance across varying task sequences.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks. Why needed: Addressing catastrophic forgetting is a primary goal of continual learning methods like AutoVCL.
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: A framework for representing uncertainty in model parameters. Why needed: VCL and AutoVCL use probabilistic modeling to maintain a distribution over model parameters, enabling better knowledge retention.
- **Task Similarity Metrics**: Measures to quantify how similar a new task is to previously learned tasks. Why needed: These metrics inform the adaptive β adjustment, allowing the model to tailor its learning strategy to the task at hand.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input Data -> Task Difficulty/Similarity Heuristics -> β Adjustment Module -> VCL Model -> Output Predictions
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves evaluating task heuristics, adjusting β, and updating the VCL model. This path ensures that the model adapts its learning strategy based on task characteristics.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The use of heuristic-based β adjustment introduces a balance between adaptability and computational efficiency. While heuristics provide a quick way to adjust β, they may not capture all task nuances, potentially limiting performance in complex scenarios.
- **Failure Signatures**: If the heuristics fail to accurately capture task difficulty or similarity, AutoVCL may struggle to adjust β appropriately, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, reliance on predefined heuristics may limit the model's adaptability to unforeseen task characteristics.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate AutoVCL on a simple continual learning benchmark (e.g., Split MNIST) to verify basic functionality.
  2. Test the adaptive β adjustment mechanism on a dataset with varying task difficulties to assess its robustness.
  3. Compare AutoVCL's performance against fixed-β GVCL variants on a mixed dataset (e.g., MNIST-CIFAR-10) to validate its adaptability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The heuristic-based approach to setting β may not generalize well to more complex or diverse task sequences, potentially limiting the robustness of AutoVCL in real-world scenarios.
- The reliance on predefined heuristics raises questions about the adaptability of the model to unforeseen task characteristics, as the heuristics may not capture all nuances of task difficulty and similarity.
- The benchmarks used (Split MNIST, Permuted MNIST, and mixed MNIST-CIFAR-10) are relatively simple and may not fully capture the challenges of more complex continual learning scenarios, necessitating further testing on more varied and challenging datasets.

## Confidence
- Performance improvements: Medium
- Generalization to complex datasets: Low
- Scalability and computational efficiency: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate AutoVCL on more complex and diverse datasets, such as CORe50 or Omniglot, to assess its adaptability and robustness in handling varied task sequences.
2. Analyze the computational overhead introduced by the adaptive β adjustment mechanism, especially in scenarios with a large number of tasks or high-dimensional data.
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the individual contributions of task difficulty and similarity metrics to the overall performance, and explore alternative heuristics or learnable approaches for setting β.
