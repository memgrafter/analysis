# Entity-based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Cyber Defence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.17647
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17647
- Authors: Isaac Symes Thompson; Alberto Caron; Chris Hicks; Vasilios Mavroudis
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Entity-based RL using Transformers (RogueNet) significantly outperforms standard MLP policies on network topology generalization tasks, achieving strong zero-shot generalization to unseen network sizes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in autonomous cyber defense: developing RL agents that can generalize across diverse network topologies. Standard reinforcement learning approaches using fixed-input neural networks struggle with variable network sizes, limiting their practical applicability. The authors propose an entity-based reinforcement learning approach where observations and actions are decomposed into discrete network entities (nodes), enabling the agent to process variable-sized networks effectively.

The proposed approach, implemented as RogueNet using a Transformer architecture within the Entity Gym framework, demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional MLP-based policies when trained across varying network topologies. Most notably, entity-based policies show strong zero-shot generalization capabilities, performing comparably to policies specifically trained on target network sizes that were not seen during training. This work represents a promising direction for developing more robust and adaptable autonomous cyber defense systems.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces an entity-based reinforcement learning framework for cyber defense, decomposing the problem into node-level entities. The approach uses the Entity Gym framework to structure observations and actions as collections of discrete entities representing network nodes. A Transformer-based policy architecture (RogueNet) processes these entity representations, enabling variable-sized input processing through attention mechanisms. The method is evaluated in a Capture-the-Flag style simulation environment where a blue agent must defend against a red agent compromising command and control nodes. The training regime involves diverse network topologies generated using the Erd˝os-Renyi model, with systematic evaluation of generalization across different network sizes.

## Key Results
- Entity-based RL policies significantly outperform standard MLP policies when training across varying network topologies
- Entity-based policies demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization, performing similarly to policies trained natively on unseen network sizes
- On fixed networks, entity-based and MLP approaches achieve comparable performance, validating the baseline effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The entity-based approach works by decomposing the network defense problem into discrete, modular components that can be processed independently yet integrated through attention mechanisms. This decomposition allows the policy to handle variable network sizes and topologies by focusing on node-level interactions rather than requiring fixed-dimensional inputs. The Transformer architecture's self-attention mechanism enables the policy to learn which node relationships are most important for decision-making, regardless of network size. This architectural choice directly addresses the fundamental limitation of MLPs with fixed input dimensions, allowing the policy to generalize across different network configurations without requiring retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Entity-based Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - To handle variable-sized inputs in network environments; Quick check - Can the policy process networks of different sizes without architectural changes?
- **Transformer Architecture in RL**: Why needed - To capture complex relationships between network entities; Quick check - Does attention mechanism improve performance over fixed-weight combinations?
- **Network Topology Generalization**: Why needed - Real networks vary in size and structure; Quick check - Can trained policies perform on networks substantially different from training data?
- **Capture-the-Flag Cyber Defense**: Why needed - Provides realistic adversarial scenario for testing; Quick check - Does the environment capture essential aspects of network defense?
- **Zero-shot Generalization**: Why needed - To evaluate true adaptability of policies; Quick check - How does performance degrade when moving to unseen network sizes?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Network Environment -> Observation Decomposition -> Entity Encoder -> Transformer Layers -> Policy Head -> Action Decomposition -> Network Environment

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves converting raw network observations into entity representations, processing them through Transformer layers to capture node relationships, and mapping the aggregated information to actions for each node.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The choice of Transformer over GNNs or other architectures represents a tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressiveness. Transformers offer strong performance on variable-sized inputs but may be less parameter-efficient than GNNs for purely graph-structured data.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation is expected when facing network topologies significantly different from training data, particularly with non-random graph structures or heterogeneous node types. The current implementation may also struggle with very large networks due to computational complexity of self-attention.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test entity-based policy on a network size exactly matching training distribution to establish baseline; 2) Evaluate zero-shot performance on a network size 50% larger than any seen during training; 3) Compare convergence speed between entity-based and MLP approaches on fixed-size networks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The evaluation uses only Erd˝os-Renyi random graphs, limiting conclusions about performance on more complex or realistic network topologies
- The red agent uses a fixed, simple attack strategy rather than more sophisticated or adaptive adversaries
- Only Transformer-based entity policies are compared to MLPs, without exploring other entity-based architectures like GNNs

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- Entity-based RL performance claims: Medium
- Zero-shot generalization claims: Medium
- Real-world applicability claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test entity-based RL performance on real-world network datasets or more diverse simulation environments to validate generalizability beyond the C2 Attack-Defense scenario
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the entity-based approach from other factors (e.g., network sizes, attack patterns) on performance
3. Evaluate the robustness of entity-based RL to network changes over time, including evolving threat landscapes and dynamic network topologies
