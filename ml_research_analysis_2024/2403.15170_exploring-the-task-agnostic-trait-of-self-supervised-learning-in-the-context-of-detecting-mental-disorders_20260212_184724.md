# Exploring the Task-agnostic Trait of Self-supervised Learning in the Context of Detecting Mental Disorders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15170
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: SSL models trained on correlated mental disorders can generate task-agnostic representations that outperform supervised baselines for cross-disorder detection

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether self-supervised learning (SSL) can generate task-agnostic representations for detecting multiple mental disorders with overlapping symptoms. The researchers modified two generative SSL models (PASE and AALBERT) to create global representations from audio and video data, then used these representations to detect major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The results show that SSL-generated representations outperform supervised deep learning baselines, with PASE-mod trained on IEMOCAP providing best MDD detection and PASE-mod trained on DAIC-WOZ yielding best PTSD detection. AALBERT with 9 or 12 transformer layers trained on combined datasets also demonstrated effective task-agnostic performance.

## Method Summary
The study employs two generative SSL models: PASE-mod (modified PASE) and AALBERT. PASE-mod is adapted with a tailored list of fixed targets and adjusted convolutional layer stride sizes to generate global representations with varying decimation factors. AALBERT uses varying transformer layers and average pooling to create global representations. Both models are trained on distinct datasets (IEMOCAP, LibriSpeech, and DAIC-WOZ) and generate representations from DAIC-WOZ audio/video data. These representations are then used to train MLP classifiers for MDD and PTSD detection, with performance evaluated using F1-scores on the test partition.

## Key Results
- PASE-mod trained on IEMOCAP with decimation factor 32k provides the best MDD detection performance
- PASE-mod trained on DAIC-WOZ with decimation factor 8k yields the best PTSD detection performance
- AALBERT with 9 or 12 transformer layers trained on combined DAIC-WOZ and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrates effective task-agnostic representation for both disorders
- SSL-generated global representations consistently outperform supervised deep learning baselines for cross-disorder detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task-agnostic representations exist for correlated mental disorders due to overlapping symptoms
- Mechanism: SSL models trained to predict fixed targets or masked frames generate global representations that capture shared behavioral attributes across MDD and PTSD
- Core assumption: Overlapping diagnostic criteria create shared signal features in audio/video data
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states overlapping symptoms justify task-agnostic representation; section I references common symptoms in diagnostic manuals
- Break condition: If symptoms between disorders are truly distinct with no shared behavioral markers, the representation would become disorder-specific

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modifying SSL encoder hyper-parameters to generate global representations improves cross-disorder detection performance
- Mechanism: Adjusting stride sizes in convolutional layers increases decimation factor, creating longer temporal context representations that capture more comprehensive behavioral patterns
- Core assumption: Global representations with extended temporal context capture more diagnostic-relevant information than localized representations
- Evidence anchors: Section II.A describes modified stride sizes increasing representation size; section IV.A investigates varying decimation factors
- Break condition: If increased temporal context introduces noise from irrelevant behavioral patterns or if disorder-specific features get diluted

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SSL models trained on one dataset can generate representations effective for detecting disorders on different datasets
- Mechanism: Representations learned from IEMOCAP (acting emotions) transfer to DAIC-WOZ (clinical interviews) for mental disorder detection
- Core assumption: Behavioral patterns in acted emotional scenarios share enough characteristics with clinical presentations to enable transfer learning
- Evidence anchors: Section IV.A shows PASE-mod trained on IEMOCAP performs best for MDD detection; section III.A describes training on IEMOCAP and LibriSpeech
- Break condition: If behavioral patterns in acted scenarios are too dissimilar from actual clinical presentations, or if domain-specific characteristics dominate

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning (SSL) and its distinction from supervised/unsupervised learning
  - Why needed here: The entire approach relies on SSL models (PASE and AALBERT) to generate task-agnostic representations without labeled disorder data
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between SSL and traditional supervised learning in terms of data requirements?

- Concept: Generative SSL approaches (predicting fixed targets vs. masked frames)
  - Why needed here: The study uses two different generative SSL architectures, each requiring understanding of their training objectives and output characteristics
  - Quick check question: How do the upstream tasks differ between PASE (fixed target prediction) and AALBERT (masked frame prediction)?

- Concept: Temporal representation and decimation in convolutional networks
  - Why needed here: The modification of stride sizes to generate global representations with varying temporal contexts is central to the approach
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the decimation factor affect the temporal resolution and context length of the generated representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SSL Encoder (PASE-mod or AALBERT) → Global Representation Generator (modified stride sizes or average pooling) → MLP Classifier (single hidden layer with 256 nodes) → Detection Output (F1-scores for PC, NC, average)
- Critical path: Training SSL encoder → Generating global representations → Training MLP classifier → Evaluating detection performance
  - Bottleneck: Training SSL encoders requires significant computational resources and time
  - Key dependency: Quality of SSL representations directly impacts classifier performance
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Decimation factor vs. temporal resolution: Higher decimation provides longer context but loses fine-grained temporal details
  - Fixed targets selection: Must balance relevance to mental disorders against model complexity
  - Dataset selection: Training on acted emotions vs. clinical data affects representation transferability
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor training accuracy on MLP classifier despite good SSL encoder training
  - Significant performance drop when using representations for the non-target disorder
  - Inconsistent results across different decimation factors or transformer layer configurations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train PASE-mod on LibriSpeech with decimation factor 160, evaluate MDD/PTSD detection performance on DAIC-WOZ
  2. Modify PASE-mod stride sizes to create decimation factors 1.6k, 8k, 16k, 32k, evaluate detection performance changes
  3. Train AALBERT on combined DAIC-WOZ + IEMOCAP, test with 3, 6, 9, 12 transformer layers for MDD/PTSD detection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the task-agnostic representation learned by SSL models generalize to detecting other mental disorders beyond MDD and PTSD?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that the current study is limited to two correlated mental disorders and suggests exploring various other correlated mental disorders as a future direction
- Why unresolved: The paper only investigates the task-agnostic trait for MDD and PTSD, leaving the generalizability to other disorders unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with SSL models to detect additional mental disorders and comparing the performance to baseline models

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of transformer layers in AALBERT on the task-agnostic representation for detecting mental disorders?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the AALBERT encoder is trained with different numbers of transformer layers (3, 6, 9, and 12) and finds that the encoder with 9 and 12 layers provides the best detection for PTSD and MDD, respectively
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of varying the number of transformer layers beyond the tested range or with other SSL models
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a wider range of transformer layers in AALBERT and other SSL models to determine the optimal number for task-agnostic representation

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the task-agnostic representation learned by SSL models compare to representations learned by other unsupervised learning approaches for detecting mental disorders?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on SSL models but does not compare their performance to other unsupervised learning approaches, such as contrastive or predictive methods
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of SSL models with other unsupervised learning approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with other unsupervised learning approaches and comparing their performance to SSL models in detecting mental disorders

## Limitations

- The study assumes symptom overlap creates sufficient shared signal features, but the degree of overlap between MDD and PTSD symptoms varies significantly across individuals, potentially limiting the generalizability of task-agnostic representations
- Transfer learning from acted emotional scenarios (IEMOCAP) to clinical interviews represents a significant domain shift, with behavioral patterns in acted versus real clinical scenarios potentially differing substantially
- The modification of stride sizes for global representation generation lacks theoretical grounding for why specific decimation factors work better than others, with the relationship between temporal context length and diagnostic signal capture remaining empirical

## Confidence

- High confidence: SSL models can generate representations useful for cross-disorder detection when symptoms overlap, supported by consistent performance improvements across multiple configurations
- Medium confidence: The specific decimation factors (8k for PTSD, 32k for MDD) provide optimal performance, though results are reproducible and selection mechanism requires further validation across different datasets
- Low confidence: AALBERT with 9 or 12 transformer layers represents the optimal configuration for task-agnostic detection, with marginal performance differences between layer counts and potential dataset-specific selection

## Next Checks

1. Test representation transferability on a third mental disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder) to verify the task-agnostic nature extends beyond the two studied disorders and to identify the limits of symptom overlap utility
2. Conduct ablation studies varying decimation factors systematically across a broader range (1k-64k) to establish the relationship between temporal context length and detection performance for different disorder types
3. Compare SSL-generated representations against supervised representations trained specifically on each disorder to quantify the performance tradeoff between task-agnostic and task-specific approaches and determine when each strategy is preferable
