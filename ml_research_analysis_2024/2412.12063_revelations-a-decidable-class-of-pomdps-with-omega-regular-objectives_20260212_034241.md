# Revelations: A Decidable Class of POMDPs with Omega-Regular Objectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12063
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12063
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduced revelation mechanisms that make classes of POMDPs with omega-regular objectives decidable, with EXPTIME-complete algorithms for weakly and strongly revealing POMDPs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental undecidability of determining whether a strategy exists to achieve omega-regular objectives almost surely in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The authors introduce revelation mechanisms that ensure the agent almost surely gains full state information at some point, creating decidable subclasses of POMDPs. They define weakly and strongly revealing POMDPs where the belief-support MDP abstraction becomes sound and complete for analyzing parity objectives. For these classes, they provide algorithms to determine the existence of almost-sure strategies by analyzing a finite belief-support MDP.

## Method Summary
The method introduces revelation mechanisms that restrict information loss in POMDPs, ensuring the agent almost surely gains full state information. For weakly revealing POMDPs, the belief-support MDP abstraction is sound and complete for parity objectives with priorities in {0,1,2}, enabling EXPTIME-complete algorithms. Strongly revealing POMDPs provide decidability for all parity objectives by ensuring every transition can occur with a revealing signal. The approach reduces the problem to analyzing a finite belief-support MDP and leveraging existing MDP algorithms for parity objectives.

## Key Results
- Introduced weakly revealing POMDPs where belief-support MDP analysis is sound and complete for parity objectives with priorities in {0,1,2}
- Introduced strongly revealing POMDPs providing decidability for all parity objectives
- Proved EXPTIME-completeness for weakly revealing POMDPs with priorities {0,1,2} and strongly revealing POMDPs with arbitrary parity objectives
- Demonstrated undecidability for weakly revealing POMDPs with priorities {1,2,3} and two-player games with strong revelations and CoBuchi objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Weakly revealing POMDPs allow the belief-support MDP abstraction to become sound and complete for parity objectives with priorities in {0,1,2}.
- Mechanism: The revelation mechanism ensures that infinitely often (almost surely), the agent gains full state information. This prevents unbounded accumulation of information loss, making the belief-support MDP analysis exact.
- Core assumption: Weak revelations occur infinitely often for any strategy, and this property is decidable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a revelation mechanism which restricts information loss by requiring that almost surely the agent has eventually full information of the current state."
  - [section 4.1] "Under the weakly revealing semantics, almost-sure strategies of the belief-support MDP carry over to the POMDP for all parity objectives."
  - [corpus] Weak, but related works mention "restriction is set to stochastic systems to make them decidable" - consistent theme
- Break condition: If information loss accumulates without bound or revelations don't occur infinitely often, the abstraction fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Strongly revealing POMDPs provide decidability for all parity objectives, not just those with restricted priorities.
- Mechanism: Stronger revelation property ensures that every possible transition can occur with a revealing signal, making the belief-support MDP both sound and complete for arbitrary parity objectives.
- Core assumption: The strongly revealing property can be checked in polynomial time and ensures that belief-support analysis is exact.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "The soundness of the analysis of the belief-support MDP for strongly revealing POMDPs follows from Proposition 1; it remains to show completeness."
  - [section 5.1] "Proposition 3. Let P = (Q, Act, Sig, δ, q0) be a strongly revealing POMDP with a parity objective... If there is an almost-sure strategy for Parity(p) in P, then there is an almost-sure strategy for Parity(pB) in PB."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence, but mentions "decidable POMDPs with parity objectives" - consistent theme
- Break condition: If some transitions cannot be accompanied by revealing signals, the property fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The belief-support MDP reduction enables EXPTIME-complete algorithms for the revealed classes.
- Mechanism: By reducing the problem to analyzing a finite belief-support MDP (exponential in state space), we can leverage existing MDP algorithms for parity objectives.
- Core assumption: Pure memoryless strategies suffice for parity objectives in MDPs, and the belief-support MDP has size exponential in the original POMDP.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "The EXPTIME algorithm is a consequence of the results from this section: by Proposition 1 (soundness) and Proposition 2 (completeness), we reduce the problem to the existence of an almost-sure strategy for a parity objective with priorities in {0, 1, 2} in an MDP of size exponential in |Q|."
  - [section 5.1] "The existence of an almost-sure strategy for parity objectives is decidable in polynomial time in MDPs (Baier and Katoen 2008, Theorem 10.127)."
  - [corpus] Mentions "decidable in polynomial time in MDPs" - consistent with evidence
- Break condition: If the belief-support MDP becomes too large or the reduction doesn't preserve the objective, complexity guarantees fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: The entire paper builds on POMDP theory and defines subclasses with restricted information loss
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a POMDP from an MDP in terms of state observability?

- Concept: Omega-regular objectives and parity conditions
  - Why needed here: The decidability results specifically address parity objectives, which generalize many common properties
  - Quick check question: How does a parity objective with priorities {0,1,2} relate to B\"uchi and CoB\"uchi objectives?

- Concept: Belief supports vs. full beliefs
  - Why needed here: The revelation mechanism exploits the difference between knowing possible states vs. exact probabilities
  - Quick check question: When does knowing the belief support provide the same information as knowing the full belief?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: POMDP → Check revelation property → Build belief-support MDP → Analyze with MDP algorithms → Return result
- Critical path: POMDP → Check revelation property → Build belief-support MDP → Analyze with MDP algorithms → Return result
- Design tradeoffs: Using belief supports instead of full beliefs reduces state space but loses some information; revelation properties add constraints but enable decidability
- Failure signatures: Undecidability results for non-revealing classes, complexity blowups when belief-support MDP is too large
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement belief-support MDP construction and verify it matches theoretical definition
  2. Test revelation property checking on simple examples (tiger POMDP variant)
  3. Run the full pipeline on weakly revealing examples with parity objectives {0,1,2} to verify EXPTIME complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can revelation mechanisms be effectively applied to other classes of stochastic systems beyond POMDPs, such as partially observable stochastic games or partially observable Markov processes with continuous state spaces?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses revelation mechanisms in POMDPs and mentions related work on restricted information loss in stochastic systems.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on POMDPs and does not explore applications to other stochastic models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal definitions of revelation mechanisms for other stochastic models and proofs of decidability results for omega-regular objectives in these extended models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the exact computational complexity of deciding whether a POMDP is weakly revealing?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that deciding whether a POMDP is weakly revealing is EXPTIME-complete but does not provide a full proof of this result.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides an EXPTIME-hardness proof but only sketches the EXPTIME membership proof.
- What evidence would resolve it: A complete proof showing both EXPTIME-hardness and EXPTIME membership for the weakly revealing property.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the revelation mechanisms be relaxed or generalized while maintaining decidability for omega-regular objectives?
- Basis in paper: The paper introduces two specific revelation mechanisms (weak and strong) and shows their decidability properties, but does not explore generalizations.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on specific revelation properties without investigating broader classes of information-revealing mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Definitions of generalized revelation properties and proofs of their impact on decidability for omega-regular objectives in POMDPs.

## Limitations
- Restrictive nature of revelation properties limits applicability to real-world POMDPs
- EXPTIME complexity remains computationally challenging for larger systems
- Undecidability results demonstrate fundamental limitations for general POMDPs with omega-regular objectives

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework and reduction proofs, as they build on established MDP theory
- Medium confidence in complexity bounds, as they rely on standard MDP algorithm results but practical performance impact is unclear
- Low confidence in practical applicability given restrictive revelation conditions and computational complexity

## Next Checks
1. Implement a benchmark suite of POMDPs with varying revelation properties to empirically validate the theoretical complexity bounds and demonstrate practical limitations of the approach.

2. Extend the analysis to compare belief-support MDPs with alternative approximations (e.g., finite-belief MDPs) to quantify the information loss and determine when revelation properties provide meaningful advantages.

3. Investigate whether approximate revelation mechanisms or relaxed revelation conditions could provide a middle ground between decidability and practical applicability for broader classes of POMDPs.
