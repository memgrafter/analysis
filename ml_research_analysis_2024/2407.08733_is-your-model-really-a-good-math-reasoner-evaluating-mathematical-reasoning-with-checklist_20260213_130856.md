- Introduces MathCheck framework for evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MathCheck, a checklist-based framework for evaluating mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The framework assesses task generalization across four mathematical tasks—problem solving, answerable judging, outcome judging, and process judging—while testing reasoning robustness through original problems and three rewritten variants (problem understanding, irrelevant disturbance, and scenario understanding). An automatic generation tool efficiently creates high-quality test cases from seed problems. Experiments with 26 LLMs and 17 MLLMs show that MathCheck better reflects genuine mathematical abilities compared to traditional benchmarks, with frontier models like GPT-4o excelling while others decline significantly. The framework also enables detailed behavior analysis and can be extended to other reasoning tasks like commonsense reasoning and code generation.

## Method Summary
MathCheck evaluates mathematical reasoning through four tasks: problem solving, answerable judging, outcome judging, and process judging. The framework generates test cases by rewriting seed problems into original problems and three variants that test different reasoning capabilities. An automatic generation tool uses a step-by-step process: extract entities and attributes from seed problems, identify task types and reasoning processes, create answer candidates, generate problem variants, and filter low-quality problems. The framework employs zero-shot and few-shot prompting to assess models' ability to solve problems and evaluate answers. Experiments compare MathCheck with traditional benchmarks like GSM8k, using Pearson correlation to measure how well each reflects genuine mathematical ability.

## Key Results
- MathCheck shows higher Pearson correlation with genuine mathematical ability compared to traditional benchmarks when evaluated on private datasets
- Frontier models like GPT-4o excel in MathCheck evaluation while other models show significant performance decline
- The framework enables detailed behavior analysis of model responses across different mathematical reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MathCheck works by creating a comprehensive evaluation framework that tests multiple dimensions of mathematical reasoning simultaneously. By using problem variants that isolate specific reasoning capabilities (problem understanding, irrelevant disturbance handling, scenario understanding), the framework can identify models that truly understand mathematical concepts versus those that rely on pattern matching. The automatic generation tool ensures scalability while maintaining quality through systematic filtering of low-quality problems. The checklist-based approach with four distinct tasks captures the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning from basic problem comprehension to sophisticated answer evaluation.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM mathematical reasoning evaluation**: Understanding how to assess mathematical capabilities in language models is crucial for developing reliable AI systems
  - Why needed: Traditional benchmarks often fail to capture the full complexity of mathematical reasoning
  - Quick check: Can the model solve novel problems that require genuine understanding rather than memorization?

- **Problem variant generation**: Creating modified versions of problems to test specific reasoning capabilities
  - Why needed: Isolates different aspects of mathematical reasoning to identify genuine understanding
  - Quick check: Do the variants successfully test the intended reasoning capabilities without being too easy or too hard?

- **Checklist-based evaluation**: Using structured checklists to assess multiple dimensions of performance
  - Why needed: Provides comprehensive coverage of different mathematical reasoning aspects
  - Quick check: Does the checklist capture all essential mathematical reasoning capabilities?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Seed problems → Automatic generation tool → Problem variants → Four task evaluations → Model assessment

Critical path: Automatic generation tool (entity extraction → variant generation → quality filtering) → MathCheck evaluation (four tasks) → Performance analysis

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes comprehensive evaluation over speed, using multiple problem variants and tasks to ensure thorough assessment. The automatic generation tool balances efficiency with quality control through filtering mechanisms.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on irrelevant disturbance variants may indicate overfitting to training data; failure on process judging may suggest inability to evaluate reasoning steps; low performance across all variants may indicate fundamental mathematical understanding gaps.

Three first experiments:
1. Test automatic generation tool on simple arithmetic problems to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate a small set of known-good and known-poor mathematical reasoning models to establish baseline performance patterns
3. Compare MathCheck results with traditional benchmarks on a common seed problem set to validate improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MathCheck performance compare to traditional benchmarks on private, uncontaminated datasets across multiple mathematical domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly compares MathCheck performance to GSM8k on the private GSM1k dataset, showing better correlation with genuine mathematical ability.
- Why unresolved: The comparison was limited to GSM8k and GSM1k datasets. Broader evaluation across multiple domains (algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.) and more private datasets would strengthen the generalizability of findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of MathCheck against traditional benchmarks on multiple private, uncontaminated datasets across various mathematical domains, with correlation analysis showing MathCheck consistently better reflects genuine mathematical ability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between seed problem complexity and task/perturbation variety in MathCheck generation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses GSM8k (elementary level) as seed data but doesn't systematically explore how seed problem complexity affects MathCheck effectiveness across different mathematical domains.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses elementary-level problems. It's unclear whether the same approach works equally well for more complex mathematical domains or if different seed complexity levels require different task/perturbation balances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies generating MathCheck datasets from seed problems of varying complexity levels across multiple mathematical domains, measuring how well each reflects genuine mathematical ability and identifying optimal complexity-task-variety relationships.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MathCheck performance correlate with real-world mathematical problem-solving success in practical applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper claims MathCheck better reflects "genuine mathematical abilities" and "mathematical intelligence" but doesn't validate this against actual practical problem-solving performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows correlation with private datasets and compression efficiency, it doesn't demonstrate whether MathCheck-predicted mathematical ability actually translates to success on real-world mathematical tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking how well MathCheck scores predict performance on practical mathematical tasks (academic performance, workplace problem-solving, etc.) compared to traditional benchmark scores, with statistical analysis of predictive validity.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on rewriting existing problems, which may introduce bias and doesn't cover the full spectrum of mathematical domains
- Limited evaluation sample with only 26 LLMs and 17 MLLMs tested, potentially missing important model behaviors
- The automatic generation tool's quality assessment process lacks full transparency, raising questions about reliability

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| MathCheck better reflects genuine mathematical abilities compared to traditional benchmarks | Medium |
| The framework can be extended to other reasoning tasks | Low |
| Automatic generation tool produces high-quality test cases | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale evaluation with a more comprehensive set of LLMs and MLLMs, including recently released models, to validate the framework's effectiveness across a broader range of models.

2. Implement a randomized controlled trial comparing MathCheck's assessment results with those from traditional benchmarks using identical model sets to quantify the claimed improvements in evaluation quality.

3. Validate the automatic generation tool's output quality through expert human review of a statistically significant sample of generated problems to ensure they maintain mathematical rigor and appropriate difficulty levels.
