# DevBench: A multimodal developmental benchmark for language learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10215
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10215
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Model-human similarity correlates strongly with task accuracy and model size, with better-performing models exhibiting response patterns more similar to those of older children and adults.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DevBench, a multimodal developmental benchmark designed to evaluate language learning models by comparing their response patterns to those of humans across different age groups. The benchmark includes seven tasks spanning lexical, syntactic, and semantic domains, with behavioral data from both children and adults. The authors evaluate a range of vision-language models on these tasks, focusing on model-human similarity in response patterns rather than absolute performance. Results show that model-human similarity correlates strongly with model accuracy and size, with better-performing models exhibiting response patterns more similar to those of older children and adults. The study also examines the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns. These findings highlight the divergence between model and human language learning processes and suggest avenues for improving language models.

## Method Summary
The DevBench benchmark evaluates vision-language models on seven multimodal tasks (three lexical, two syntactic, two semantic) using human behavioral datasets from children and adults. Models are assessed through softmax-optimized Kullback-Leibler divergence for lexical/syntactic tasks and representational similarity analysis (RSA) for semantic tasks. The evaluation pipeline computes model responses on each trial, processes logits with temperature optimization, calculates divergence/RSA values, and aggregates results across tasks and age groups. The authors examine correlations between model-human similarity and model features (accuracy, size, training data), and analyze OpenCLIP training trajectories using intermediate checkpoints to map developmental progression.

## Key Results
- Model-human similarity correlates strongly with task accuracy and model size, with larger, better-performing models showing response patterns more similar to older children and adults
- OpenCLIP training trajectory demonstrates developmental progression, with early checkpoints resembling younger humans and later checkpoints resembling older humans
- Models struggle more with ambiguous or polysemous targets compared to humans, suggesting humans use pragmatic reasoning to resolve ambiguity while models rely on statistical likelihoods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Model-human similarity in response patterns correlates with task accuracy and model size.
- Mechanism: Better-performing and larger models capture more human-like representations because their training enables finer-grained alignment with human linguistic processing.
- Core assumption: The softmax-optimized KL divergence accurately captures model-human response similarity, assuming model logits are well-calibrated to human probabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show that model-human similarity correlates strongly with task accuracy and size, with better-performing models exhibiting response patterns more similar to those of older children and adults."
  - [section]: "Overall, we found that model-human similarity was most correlated with task accuracy, with consistently high correlations across all ages and tasks."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no related work directly tested this calibration assumption in developmental benchmarks.
- Break condition: If model logits are poorly calibrated or if response patterns depend on factors other than accuracy/size (e.g., specific training data composition), the correlation would weaken.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: OpenCLIP training trajectory recovers developmental trends, with early checkpoints resembling younger humans and later checkpoints resembling older humans.
- Mechanism: As OpenCLIP trains, its representations gradually shift from coarse to fine-grained, mirroring how children's linguistic representations mature with age.
- Core assumption: Training checkpoints provide a meaningful proxy for developmental stages and that human developmental trends are continuous rather than stage-like.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We also examine the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns."
  - [section]: "OpenCLIP exhibited greatest similarity to younger humans earlier in the training regime, and greatest similarity to older humans later in the training regime."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; the corpus neighbors focus on developmental frameworks but do not directly validate OpenCLIP as a developmental model.
- Break condition: If developmental stages are discontinuous or if model training does not map linearly to human development, this trajectory analogy would break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Item-level analysis reveals that models struggle more with ambiguous or polysemous targets compared to humans.
- Mechanism: Humans use pragmatic reasoning to resolve ambiguity, while models rely on statistical likelihoods, leading to divergent response patterns on items with multiple plausible interpretations.
- Core assumption: Pragmatic reasoning is the key human strategy for resolving ambiguous multimodal inputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For VV, some such features include polysemous targets... For WG, several of the most dissimilar items have genuinely contentious captions... humans appear to be better able to handle ambiguity and choose the most likely answer (perhaps through pragmatic reasoning)."
  - [abstract]: No direct mention of pragmatic reasoning, but highlights divergence between model and human learning processes.
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no corpus neighbor explicitly discusses pragmatic reasoning in multimodal benchmarks.
- Break condition: If ambiguity resolution in humans does not rely primarily on pragmatic reasoning, or if models improve pragmatic reasoning through fine-tuning, this divergence would diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Softmax temperature optimization in KL divergence
  - Why needed here: To align model logits with human response distributions when calibration differs.
  - Quick check question: If β = 1, what does the softmax-optimised KL divergence reduce to?

- Concept: Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)
  - Why needed here: To compare geometric similarity of human and model representations in semantic tasks without assuming shared feature spaces.
  - Quick check question: In RSA, what does a high Spearman correlation between RSMs indicate about human-model similarity?

- Concept: Developmental benchmark construction
  - Why needed here: To ensure tasks have age-appropriate difficulty and corresponding human data across multiple linguistic domains.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to compare model response patterns rather than just accuracy in developmental benchmarks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data loading → human response preprocessing → model inference on each trial → logit processing (softmax/β tuning) → divergence/RSA calculation → aggregation across tasks and age bins
- Critical path: Data loading → human response preprocessing → model inference on each trial → logit processing (softmax/β tuning) → divergence/RSA calculation → aggregation across tasks and age bins
- Design tradeoffs: Using softmax-optimised KL divergence assumes logit calibration; RSA similarity requires sufficient trial numbers for stable RSMs; age binning can reduce statistical power but increases developmental resolution
- Failure signatures: High KL divergence despite high accuracy suggests mismatched response distributions; low RSA similarity with good accuracy indicates representational geometry differences; inconsistent trajectories across tasks hint at domain-specific learning dynamics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a baseline random model to confirm upper bound on KL divergence/RSA similarity
  2. Compare softmax temperature β values across tasks to check calibration assumptions
  3. Run ablation on task subsets to identify which linguistic domain contributes most to overall model-human similarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific aspects of ambiguity resolution in language models need improvement to better match human performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that models appear worse than humans at handling ambiguous inputs, particularly in tasks like Visual Vocabulary and Winoground where humans excel at choosing the most likely answer through pragmatic reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies ambiguity resolution as a key area for improvement but doesn't specify which aspects (e.g., pragmatic inference, context understanding, disambiguation strategies) are most critical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies analyzing model and human performance on specific types of ambiguous stimuli (e.g., polysemous words, context-dependent meanings) with detailed error analysis would help identify the precise mechanisms that need improvement.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do multimodal models trained on developmentally realistic data compare to those trained on adult-level data in terms of human-likeness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions CVCL, a model trained on infant egocentric video data, but notes it performed poorly on most tasks. However, it outperformed other models on the visual object categorization task, suggesting some aspects of human-like representation.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated one model trained on developmentally realistic data, limiting conclusions about whether such training leads to more human-like representations overall.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of multiple models trained on both developmental and adult-level data across a range of tasks measuring different aspects of language ability would clarify whether developmentally realistic training improves human-likeness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the key differences between semantic representations in multimodal models versus unimodal models, and how do these differences relate to human semantic development?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that multimodal model representations may be less applicable to semantics tasks, with OpenCLIP-H showing non-monotonic or decreasing human-likeness on visual object categorization and THINGS tasks over training.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests multimodal models may not capture human visual semantic representations as effectively as other aspects of language, but doesn't explore the underlying reasons or compare to unimodal alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of semantic representations in multimodal versus unimodal models, using both behavioral data from humans and neuroscientific measures of semantic processing, would elucidate the nature of these differences and their developmental implications.

## Limitations

- The calibration assumption underlying softmax-optimized KL divergence is not directly validated, raising questions about whether optimized temperature truly reflects human cognitive processing
- The developmental trajectory analysis assumes continuous development, potentially missing qualitative shifts and stage-like transitions in human language acquisition
- Task selection may not fully represent the complexity of human language acquisition, particularly in pragmatic reasoning and contextual understanding

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of comparing model response patterns to human behavioral data using established metrics (KL divergence, RSA) is technically sound. The observed correlation between model-human similarity and model accuracy/size is statistically robust across multiple evaluation settings.

**Medium Confidence:** The developmental trajectory analysis showing OpenCLIP checkpoints mapping to different age groups is suggestive but requires careful interpretation. While the pattern is consistent, the mapping between training steps and developmental stages is conceptual rather than empirically validated.

**Low Confidence:** The interpretation that pragmatic reasoning is the primary driver of human superiority in handling ambiguous items remains speculative. The authors identify this as a potential mechanism but do not directly test alternative explanations such as working memory differences, processing speed, or task-specific strategies.

## Next Checks

1. **Calibration Validation Study:** Conduct a systematic evaluation of the softmax temperature optimization by comparing model-human similarity across different β values and validation metrics. Test whether the optimized temperature actually improves the alignment of model representations with human cognitive processes, rather than just producing lower divergence scores through mathematical adjustment.

2. **Developmental Discontinuity Analysis:** Examine the OpenCLIP training trajectory for evidence of discontinuous shifts rather than smooth progression. Compare checkpoint similarities to human age groups using non-linear models and test whether certain training stages correspond to qualitative changes in performance patterns, similar to documented developmental stages in children.

3. **Pragmatic Reasoning Ablation:** Design controlled experiments to isolate pragmatic reasoning as a factor in human-model divergence. Create versions of ambiguous items with varying contextual richness and test whether human response patterns change systematically with added pragmatic cues, while model responses remain stable, confirming the proposed mechanism.
