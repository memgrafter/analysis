# Designing Robust Cyber-Defense Agents with Evolving Behavior Trees

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.16383
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16383
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** EBTs achieved 39% higher average reward than state-of-the-art baseline in CAGE Challenge Scenario 2 against adaptive attackers

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs) as a framework for autonomous cyber-defense agents that combine standard and learning-enabled components in a modular, explainable architecture. The EBT structure is automatically learned using genetic programming in a novel abstract cyber environment called Cyber-Firefighter, which simulates pursuit-evasion dynamics for efficient optimization. Learning-enabled components are then trained for robustness and strategy switching in realistic network environments. When evaluated in CybORG's CAGE Challenge Scenario 2 against an adaptive attacker that switches strategies mid-episode, the EBT achieved a 39% improvement in average reward compared to the state-of-the-art CardiffUni solution.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach combines evolutionary optimization with learning-enabled components through a two-stage process. First, genetic programming optimizes the EBT structure in an abstract Cyber-Firefighter environment that captures core pursuit-evasion dynamics while enabling faster training than realistic simulations. Second, learning-enabled components are integrated and trained for robustness and adaptive strategy switching in the realistic CybORG environment. The EBT architecture provides modular integration of standard and learning components while maintaining explainability through decision tracing at the behavior tree level.

## Key Results
- EBT achieved 39% higher average reward than CardiffUni baseline in CAGE Challenge Scenario 2
- Demonstrated effective strategy switching when attacker changed tactics mid-episode
- Provided high-level explanations of defense decisions through behavior tree execution traces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The EBT approach works by leveraging genetic programming to discover optimal behavior tree structures in an abstract environment that captures essential cyber defense dynamics while enabling faster optimization. This learned structure then serves as a framework for integrating learning-enabled components that handle complex, data-driven decisions. The modular architecture allows standard components to handle well-defined tasks while learning components address uncertain or complex scenarios. The explainability emerges naturally from the behavior tree structure, which provides interpretable decision paths that can be traced and monitored at runtime.

## Foundational Learning
- **Genetic Programming for EBT Optimization**: Evolutionary algorithms search the space of possible behavior tree structures to find optimal configurations; needed for automatic discovery of effective defense strategies without manual design
- **Abstract Cyber Environment Design**: Cyber-Firefighter abstracts key pursuit-evasion dynamics while simplifying simulation; needed to enable efficient genetic programming optimization that would be too slow in realistic environments
- **Learning-Enabled Component Integration**: Neural networks or other ML models are integrated into EBT nodes for complex decision-making; needed to handle uncertain or data-driven aspects of cyber defense
- **Strategy Switching Mechanisms**: Learning components detect attacker behavior changes and trigger EBT reconfiguration; needed to maintain effectiveness when attackers adapt mid-engagement
- **Explainable AI through Behavior Trees**: Tree structure provides natural interpretability through execution traces; needed for transparency and runtime monitoring in safety-critical cyber defense
- **Modular Architecture Design**: Separates standard and learning components while maintaining unified control flow; needed for maintainability and incremental improvement of individual components

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Cyber-Firefighter Environment -> Genetic Programming Optimizer -> Initial EBT Structure
Realistic CybORG Environment -> Learning Component Trainer -> Enhanced EBT with Learning Nodes
EBT Executor -> Runtime Monitoring System -> Defense Actions

**Critical Path:**
1. Cyber-Firefighter simulation provides fitness evaluation for genetic programming
2. Genetic programming evolves optimal EBT structure over generations
3. Learning components are trained in CybORG environment and integrated into EBT
4. Runtime execution traces provide explanations and monitoring data

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Abstract vs realistic simulation: Cyber-Firefighter enables faster optimization but may miss some real-world complexities
- Modularity vs performance: Separate components improve maintainability but may introduce coordination overhead
- Explainability vs capability: Behavior trees provide transparency but may limit some complex strategies

**Failure Signatures:**
- EBT structure overfits to Cyber-Firefighter environment and performs poorly in CybORG
- Learning components fail to generalize from training environment to real attacks
- Strategy switching triggers too frequently or not frequently enough
- Runtime monitoring cannot effectively map execution traces to meaningful explanations

**First Experiments:**
1. Test EBT performance in Cyber-Firefighter with varying attacker patterns
2. Validate learning component robustness to input noise and distribution shifts
3. Measure explanation quality through human evaluation of execution traces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Results are confined to a single scenario (CAGE Challenge Scenario 2) and opponent strategy
- EBT's reliance on genetic programming introduces computational overhead and potential overfitting to the specific Cyber-Firefighter environment
- Learning-enabled components' performance under novel attack patterns or system configurations remains untested
- Explainability claims are based on high-level decision tracing rather than comprehensive interpretability analysis

## Confidence

**High confidence:** EBT architecture design and integration with learning components
**Medium confidence:** Performance improvements over baseline (dependent on simulation fidelity)
**Medium confidence:** Runtime explainability benefits (limited to decision trace analysis)
**Low confidence:** Generalization to diverse attack scenarios and real-world deployments

## Next Checks
1. Test EBT performance against multiple attacker types and strategies beyond Scenario 2
2. Evaluate system behavior under realistic network configurations and variable system loads
3. Conduct formal interpretability analysis comparing EBT explanations to ground-truth attack progression
