# RedTest: Towards Measuring Redundancy in Deep Neural Networks Effectively

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.10507
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10507
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces MSRS metric that quantifies structural redundancy in DNNs through layer representation similarity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RedTest, a novel framework for measuring and optimizing structural redundancy in deep neural networks. The core contribution is the Model Structural Redundancy Score (MSRS), which quantifies redundancy by analyzing the similarity of intermediate representations across network layers using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). Experiments on over 35,000 DNN models demonstrate that MSRS effectively identifies redundancy in state-of-the-art architectures, which often exhibit surprisingly high levels of structural redundancy. The framework is applied to two practical scenarios: NAS, where a redundancy-aware algorithm guided by MSRS finds better models with less redundancy while maintaining accuracy, and pruning, where layer similarity-guided pruning reduces redundancy with minimal accuracy loss.

## Method Summary
RedTest introduces a comprehensive framework for measuring structural redundancy in DNNs through the Model Structural Redundancy Score (MSRS). The framework analyzes intermediate representations across network layers using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to quantify similarity, with higher similarity scores indicating greater redundancy. The approach assumes that when different layers produce similar representations, they may be computing redundant information. MSRS is computed by measuring CKA similarity between all pairs of intermediate representations in a network, creating a comprehensive redundancy profile. This metric is then integrated into two optimization scenarios: neural architecture search (NAS) where it guides the search toward less redundant architectures, and pruning where it informs which layers or neurons can be safely removed with minimal accuracy impact.

## Key Results
- MSRS successfully identifies high redundancy levels in state-of-the-art architectures across 35,000+ models
- NAS with MSRS guidance discovers models that outperform traditional approaches while being less redundant
- Layer similarity-guided pruning reduces structural redundancy with minimal accuracy loss
- MSRS demonstrates superior ability to reveal redundancy compared to traditional metrics (Params, FLOPs, Latency)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RedTest works by leveraging the insight that redundant computation in DNNs manifests as similar representations across different layers. When multiple layers produce similar intermediate outputs, they may be performing similar transformations on the data, indicating computational redundancy. CKA provides a principled way to measure representation similarity that is invariant to orthogonal transformations and isotropic scaling, making it well-suited for comparing representations across different layers or architectures. By quantifying these similarities across the entire network, MSRS creates a comprehensive map of structural redundancy that can guide optimization efforts toward removing truly redundant components rather than those that appear redundant by traditional metrics.

## Foundational Learning

Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA):
- Why needed: Provides a principled similarity metric between representations that is invariant to orthogonal transformations
- Quick check: Verify CKA values between identical and random representations should be 1 and 0 respectively

Structural Redundancy:
- Why needed: Understanding when different network components perform similar computations
- Quick check: High CKA similarity between distant layers may indicate bypass or shortcut behavior

Model Complexity Metrics:
- Why needed: Traditional metrics (Params, FLOPs) don't capture representational redundancy
- Quick check: Compare MSRS with traditional metrics on known redundant architectures

Neural Architecture Search (NAS):
- Why needed: Optimizing architecture design while considering redundancy
- Quick check: Verify search space includes diverse architectural patterns

Model Pruning:
- Why needed: Removing redundant components while preserving accuracy
- Quick check: Ensure pruned models maintain baseline performance

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input -> Backbone Layers -> CKA Similarity Computation -> MSRS Aggregation -> Optimization Module

Critical Path:
1. Extract intermediate representations from all layers
2. Compute pairwise CKA similarities
3. Aggregate similarities into MSRS score
4. Use MSRS for optimization (NAS or pruning)

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational cost of CKA computation vs. accuracy of redundancy measurement
- Granularity of layer-wise analysis vs. practical optimization speed
- MSRS sensitivity to architectural differences vs. generalizability across domains

Failure Signatures:
- High MSRS but poor correlation with actual performance gains
- MSRS variations not reflecting meaningful architectural differences
- Computational overhead making real-time optimization impractical

First Experiments:
1. Compute MSRS on a simple VGG network vs. a known efficient architecture
2. Compare CKA similarities across different depths in a residual network
3. Apply layer similarity-guided pruning on a small CNN and measure accuracy impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on CKA may not capture all forms of functional redundancy versus superficial similarity
- Framework effectiveness on emerging architectures (transformers, graph neural networks) remains unverified
- Empirical relationship between MSRS scores and actual performance gains lacks theoretical grounding

## Confidence

**High**: The MSRS metric effectively measures representation similarity across layers using CKA
**Medium**: The correlation between MSRS and actual model performance/optimization potential
**Medium**: The framework's effectiveness in diverse architectural contexts

## Next Checks

1. Test MSRS on emerging architectures beyond traditional CNNs, particularly transformers and vision transformers, to validate generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing CKA with alternative similarity metrics (e.g., canonical correlation analysis, mutual information) to verify robustness of redundancy measurements
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on domain-specific tasks with limited data to assess real-world applicability
