# Expressive Higher-Order Link Prediction through Hypergraph Symmetry Breaking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11339
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11339
- Authors: Simon Zhang; Cheng Xin; Tamal K. Dey
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improves PR-AUC scores for higher-order link prediction on various hypergraph datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of expressive higher-order link prediction in hypergraphs by proposing a method to break symmetry in hypergraph topology. The authors identify regular subhypergraphs exhibiting symmetry and replace them with single hyperedges during training, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between different node sets. This preprocessing approach improves the expressivity of hypergraph neural networks and demonstrates performance gains across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The core contribution is a preprocessing algorithm that identifies regular subhypergraphs with symmetry and replaces them with single hyperedges before training hypergraph neural networks. By breaking topological symmetries, the method enhances the model's discriminative power for higher-order link prediction tasks. The approach runs once as a preprocessing step and is compatible with various hypergraph neural network architectures.

## Key Results
- Improves PR-AUC scores for higher-order link prediction on multiple hypergraph datasets
- Outperforms baseline methods and uniform hyperedge dropping baselines
- Provides theoretical guarantees on expressivity improvement
- Demonstrates efficient runtime in practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental limitation of symmetry in hypergraph structures. When regular subhypergraphs exhibit symmetry, hypergraph neural networks struggle to distinguish between different node sets, limiting their expressive power. By replacing these symmetric structures with single hyperedges, the method breaks this symmetry, allowing the model to learn more discriminative representations for link prediction tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Hypergraph Symmetry**: Regular patterns in hypergraph topology that cause node sets to be indistinguishable
   - Why needed: Understanding symmetry is crucial for identifying the core problem being addressed
   - Quick check: Can identify symmetric patterns in simple hypergraph examples

2. **Regular Subhypergraphs**: Substructures where hyperedges share similar connectivity patterns
   - Why needed: These are the specific structures targeted for replacement
   - Quick check: Can recognize regular subhypergraphs in example hypergraphs

3. **Expressivity in Graph Neural Networks**: The ability of a model to distinguish between different graph structures
   - Why needed: The paper's improvements are measured in terms of expressivity gains
   - Quick check: Can explain why certain graph structures might be indistinguishable to standard GNNs

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Hypergraph Dataset -> Preprocessing Algorithm -> HNN Model -> Link Prediction Output

Critical Path:
1. Identify regular subhypergraphs with symmetry in the input hypergraph
2. Replace symmetric subhypergraphs with single hyperedges
3. Train hypergraph neural network on modified hypergraph
4. Use trained model for link prediction on test data

Design Tradeoffs:
- **Pros**: Improves expressivity, runs efficiently as preprocessing, compatible with various HNN architectures
- **Cons**: May lose some information when replacing regular subhypergraphs, limited empirical evaluation scope

Failure Signatures:
- Minimal performance improvement despite successful symmetry breaking
- Degradation in PR-AUC scores on certain datasets
- High computational cost for very large hypergraphs

First Experiments:
1. Apply the preprocessing algorithm to a small synthetic hypergraph with known symmetric structures
2. Compare PR-AUC scores before and after symmetry breaking on a benchmark dataset
3. Test the method with different hypergraph neural network architectures to verify compatibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions beyond noting that the theoretical analysis focuses on symmetry breaking as a mechanism for improving expressivity, but does not fully address the potential loss of information when regular subhypergraphs are replaced by single hyperedges.

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation limited to specific datasets and baselines
- Theoretical analysis does not fully address information loss from replacing regular subhypergraphs
- Scalability discussion lacks detailed runtime analysis for very large hypergraphs

## Confidence
- Expressivity improvement claims: Medium
- Empirical performance gains: Medium
- Theoretical guarantees: High
- Scalability and efficiency: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on a broader range of hypergraph datasets, including those with varying densities and sizes, to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of replacing regular subhypergraphs on the overall information content of the hypergraph.
3. Provide a detailed runtime analysis and scalability assessment, particularly for large-scale hypergraphs.
