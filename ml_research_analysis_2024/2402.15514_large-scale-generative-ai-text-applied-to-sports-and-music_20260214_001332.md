# Large Scale Generative AI Text Applied to Sports and Music

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.15514
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15514
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Successfully deployed generative AI system for sports and music events supporting 90 million fans with 8 billion page views

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a large-scale generative AI system that transforms multimodal event data into coherent text commentary and personalized news stories for sports and music events. The system processes diverse data streams including videos, articles, real-time scoring feeds, statistics, and fact sheets using generative AI models. Successfully deployed at major events including ESPN Fantasy Football, GRAMMYs, US Open, and Masters Tournament, the system achieved a 15x speed improvement, Rouge-L of 82.00, and perplexity of 6.6 while serving 90 million fans with 8 billion page views.

## Method Summary
The system ingests multimodal data streams and organizes them using RDF graph ontologies to preserve entity relationships and temporal order. Rather than expensive fine-tuning, it employs few-shot learning with engineered prompt templates containing 20 example pairs per task. For knowledge-intensive tasks, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates relevant external context. The pipeline includes pre-processing for data consistency, LLM inference using models like T5-Large and Llama 2 variants, and post-processing for hallucination detection and factual corrections before content delivery through CDN infrastructure.

## Key Results
- 15x speed improvement in content generation compared to previous methods
- Average Rouge-L score of 82.00 for generated text quality
- Perplexity of 6.6 indicating high fluency and coherence
- Successfully deployed at major events supporting 90 million fans with 8 billion page views

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multimodal data fusion enables coherent text generation for live events. The system ingests diverse data streams and uses RDF graphs to organize relationships before feeding them into LLMs. Core assumption: All modalities can be transformed into a unified structured format that preserves temporal and contextual coherence. Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions multimodal transformation into coherent text; RDF graph service models entity relationships; corpus neighbors discuss commentary generation. Break condition: Pipeline delays if any modality fails or data consistency checks fail.

### Mechanism 2
Few-shot learning with engineered prompts reduces expensive fine-tuning needs. The system uses prompt templates with 20 example pairs to guide LLMs in transforming structured inputs into desired outputs. Core assumption: Large LLMs have sufficient generalization capability to adapt to new domains given representative in-context examples. Evidence anchors: ESPN system used 20 examples for 13 statistics; experiments began with few-shot learning around decoder LLMs; corpus neighbors mention commentary generation. Break condition: Output quality degrades if prompts don't cover edge cases or model cannot infer mappings.

### Mechanism 3
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual correctness for open-ended content. For GRAMMYs, the system retrieves relevant artist data and injects it into prompt context to ground generation in verified facts. Core assumption: External retrieval can provide timely, accurate context that LLM would otherwise fabricate. Evidence anchors: GRAMMY system pulls from Recording Academy articles, biographies, and Wikipedia; most relevant data included within RAG; corpus neighbors discuss commentary generation. Break condition: Generated text may still contain hallucinations if retrieval fails or content is outdated.

## Foundational Learning

- **Structured data representation (RDF/ontology)**: Needed to organize multimodal event data into queryable format preserving entity relationships and temporal order. Quick check: Can you construct a simple RDF triple that links a player, a tournament, and a score?

- **Prompt engineering and few-shot learning**: Needed to adapt large LLMs to domain-specific tasks without expensive fine-tuning. Quick check: How many example pairs should you include in a prompt to achieve stable few-shot performance based on the paper?

- **Post-processing and hallucination detection**: Needed to ensure generated text adheres to factual constraints and domain-specific vocabulary. Quick check: What regex-based check would you implement to validate that a generated tennis score follows official rules?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Kafka topics (event streams) -> RDF graph service (structured queries) -> LLM inference services (T5-Large, IBM Sandstone 3B, Llama 2 variants) -> Cloudant/COS (content storage) -> CDN (global delivery) -> Batch job runners (ESPN Fantasy Football)

- **Critical path**: Event data → Kafka topic → Pre-processing → RDF query + data consistency checks → Prompt engineering → structured input → LLM inference → raw text → Post-processing → corrections, hallucination mitigation → Storage → Cloudant/COS → CDN purge → user delivery

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fine-tuning vs few-shot (control vs speed); Model size vs latency (quality vs infrastructure needs); Human review vs automation (quality vs scalability)

- **Failure signatures**: Kafka consumer lag (delayed commentary); RDF query timeout (incomplete structured data); LLM hallucination spike (increased post-processing); CDN cache miss rate increase (degraded user experience)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Deploy T5-Large on single GPU with golf shot tuples, measure word edit distance; 2) Implement few-shot learning with Llama 2 7B for ESPN Fantasy Football slot fillers, measure personalization accuracy; 3) Set up RAG with Llama 2 70B for GRAMMY artist content, compare perplexity with/without retrieved context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can generative multimedia workflows be optimized to combine text, sound, images, and video from multiple inputs in real-time? Basis: Paper mentions investigating generative multimedia workflows combining LLMs with diffusion models, LVMs, and GANs. Unresolved because paper focuses on text generation without exploring multiple media types. Resolution: Demonstrations of real-time generative multimedia systems producing synchronized text, audio, images, and video from diverse inputs at scale.

### Open Question 2
What are the most effective methods for automatic detection and mitigation of hallucination errors in large language models without human review? Basis: Paper discusses need for automatic hallucination detection and mitigation, as current workflows rely heavily on human editors. Unresolved because paper mentions post-processing methods but lacks comprehensive automated solution. Resolution: Development and validation of automated hallucination detection and correction systems achieving performance comparable to or better than human reviewers.

### Open Question 3
How can model distillation techniques be effectively applied to reduce size of multimedia models while maintaining performance? Basis: Paper mentions extending model distillation work to multimedia models for future research. Unresolved because paper focuses on text generation without exploring model distillation for multimedia. Resolution: Successful implementation of model distillation techniques significantly reducing multimedia model size while preserving or improving performance.

## Limitations

- Missing technical specifications for prompt templates, few-shot examples, and RDF schema definitions prevent precise reproduction
- Evaluation methodology lacks detail on ground truth establishment, systematic human evaluation, and comparative analysis across model variants
- Performance attribution ambiguity regarding relative contributions of PEFT LoRA, model architecture changes, and infrastructure optimization
- Scalability claims lack technical analysis of concurrent request handling, latency distribution, and failure rates at scale

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (well-supported by evidence):
- System successfully deployed at major events (ESPN Fantasy Football, GRAMMYs, US Open, Masters Tournament)
- Multimodal data fusion approach is technically feasible and implemented
- Few-shot learning with prompt engineering reduces fine-tuning needs
- RAG improves factual grounding for open-ended content

**Medium Confidence** (plausible but limited evidence):
- 15x speed improvement is real but not precisely contextualized
- Rouge-L of 82.00 represents strong performance without clear baseline comparison
- System can handle 90 million concurrent users based on CDN delivery

**Low Confidence** (assertions lacking sufficient evidence):
- Specific performance gains attributable to each technical component
- Generalization capability across different event types and domains
- Long-term stability and hallucination rates in production

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Template Replication Test**: Reconstruct few-shot learning setup using publicly available models (T5-Large, Llama 2 7B) and described task format. Measure performance with different numbers of examples (5, 10, 20) to validate claimed effectiveness and identify optimal sample size.

2. **Controlled Ablation Study**: Implement minimal version of RDF-based multimodal pipeline and systematically disable components (RAG, few-shot learning, post-processing) to measure individual contributions to final output quality and system performance.

3. **Stress Testing Protocol**: Deploy scaled-down version of system and subject to increasing concurrent request loads while monitoring response times, error rates, and hallucination frequency. Compare performance against claimed production metrics to validate scalability claims.
