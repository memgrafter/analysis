# Towards a Brazilian History Knowledge Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.19856
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19856
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Only 51% of thematic and 38% of biographical DHBB entries could be automatically mapped to Wikidata items

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the challenges of creating a knowledge graph for Brazilian history by mapping named entities from the Brazilian Historical-Biographical Dictionary (DHBB) to Wikidata concepts. Using the wikimapper tool, the authors found significant gaps in Wikidata's coverage of Brazilian historical entities, with only about half of thematic entries and less than half of biographical entries being automatically mappable. Manual evaluation revealed that while humans could find 30% of currently unmapped entries, automated mappings also contained substantial errors (16-34% incorrect). The study highlights the need for completing Wikidata with Brazilian historical entities to create a comprehensive knowledge graph for cultural heritage preservation.

## Method Summary
The authors extracted 7,863 entry titles from the DHBB corpus and used the wikimapper tool to automatically map these titles to Wikidata Q items. They then conducted manual evaluation on a sample of 100 entries (25 from each category: mapped/unmapped thematic and biographical) to assess mapping accuracy and identify false positives and negatives. The evaluation aimed to determine what proportion of unmapped entries could be found by humans and what proportion of automatically mapped entries were incorrect.

## Key Results
- Only 51% of thematic entry titles and 38% of biographical entry titles in DHBB could be automatically mapped to Wikidata items
- 30% of unmapped names could be found by human evaluators
- 16-34% of automatically mapped entries were incorrect
- Wikidata lacks many Brazilian political parties, organizations, and historical events documented in DHBB

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mapping DHBB entry titles to Wikidata items via wikimapper fails to capture many Brazilian historical entities due to missing or misnamed concepts in Wikidata.
- Mechanism: Automatic string matching between DHBB titles and Wikidata Q items produces high false negative and false positive rates, as Wikidata lacks Brazilian-specific entries or contains disambiguated items with different names.
- Core assumption: Wikidata entries for Brazilian political entities, organizations, and historical events are incomplete or poorly named, preventing accurate automated mapping.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using the wikimapper tool, the authors found that only 51% of thematic entry titles and 38% of biographical entry titles in DHBB could be automatically mapped to Wikidata items."
  - [section 5] "We can only find some items like the Conselho de Comunicação Social (CCS) using a web search engine. Perhaps because search engines find and index information from government sites..."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence provided about string matching failure modes.
- Break condition: When Wikidata coverage of Brazilian historical entities improves significantly, or when better mapping tools account for name variants and disambiguation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Human evaluation reveals significant mapping errors in automated wikimapper results, with 16-34% of automatically mapped entries being incorrect.
- Mechanism: Manual review of a sample of mapped entries identifies false positives (wrong Wikidata items) and false negatives (missed correct mappings), demonstrating the need for human-in-the-loop verification.
- Core assumption: Automated tools cannot reliably distinguish between entities with similar names or handle Portuguese naming conventions without human judgment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Manual evaluation revealed that 30% of unmapped names could be found by humans, while 16-34% of automatically mapped entries were incorrect."
  - [section 5.2] "Out of the 25 names of people that Wikimapper finds no Q items for, we realize that 30% can be found by a human. Also, for the 25 names of people (biographical entries) that Wikimapper can find entries, 16% of the names automatically mapped are wrong..."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence about manual evaluation methodology.
- Break condition: When mapping accuracy exceeds 95% without human intervention, or when human evaluation resources become unavailable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DHBB entities often correspond to larger Wikidata concepts or lack entries entirely due to being defunct or too specific, creating mapping challenges.
- Mechanism: Many DHBB entries represent sub-concepts of existing Wikidata items or refer to entities no longer active, making them invisible to automated search tools that only find direct matches.
- Core assumption: Wikidata prioritizes current, notable entities and major concepts, missing historical sub-entities and defunct organizations that are well-documented in specialized historical dictionaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "A most frequent case is when we are trying to find a Wikidata or Wikipedia page for a concept that is part of a larger concept. Many times, only the larger concept has its own Wikipedia/Wikidata item."
  - [section 5.1] "Some typos preclude the proper working of the search (e.g. the DHBB entry is called Ação Imperial Patrionovista... instead of the correct version for Wikipedia Ação Imperial Patrianovista...)"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence about sub-concept relationships.
- Break condition: When Wikidata adopts comprehensive historical entity coverage or when specialized historical knowledge graphs are developed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Portuguese text
  - Why needed here: The DHBB corpus contains thousands of Brazilian historical entities that must be accurately identified before mapping to Wikidata
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of named entities mentioned as being extracted from the DHBB corpus?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph construction and maintenance
  - Why needed here: The project aims to create a structured knowledge graph for Brazilian history by connecting DHBB entities to Wikidata
  - Quick check question: What is the primary structured database that the authors are using as the backbone for their Brazilian history knowledge graph?

- Concept: Wikidata query and search APIs
  - Why needed here: The mapping process relies on automated tools like wikimapper to find corresponding Q items, requiring understanding of Wikidata's search capabilities
  - Quick check question: What percentage of thematic entry titles in DHBB could be automatically mapped to Wikidata items using wikimapper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DHBB corpus (GitHub repository) -> wikimapper tool -> Wikidata search API -> manual evaluation spreadsheet -> completed knowledge graph
- Critical path: Entity extraction from DHBB -> automated mapping via wikimapper -> manual validation of results -> completion of missing Wikidata entries -> knowledge graph construction
- Design tradeoffs: Automated mapping provides scalability but low accuracy (51-38% success rate), while manual evaluation ensures quality but doesn't scale to thousands of entries
- Failure signatures: Low mapping success rates (below 50%), high false positive rates in automated mapping, inability to find entities that exist in DHBB but not Wikidata
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run wikimapper on a small sample of 50 DHBB thematic entries and manually verify the results to establish baseline accuracy metrics
  2. Test search engine indexing by taking unmapped DHBB entries and attempting to find them through Google/Bing to identify alternative mapping strategies
  3. Create a mapping evaluation spreadsheet with 100 random entries (50 thematic, 50 biographical) to establish the proportion of correct/incorrect automated mappings and findable human mappings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal methodology for completing Wikidata with missing Brazilian historical entities from the DHBB dictionary?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that "completing Wikidata with DHBB entities is necessary to create a comprehensive knowledge graph for Brazilian history" and discusses the current gaps in Wikidata mapping.
- Why unresolved: The paper describes the problem and shows that manual intervention can find 30% of currently unmapped entries, but doesn't propose a systematic methodology for completion.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed methodology showing automated, semi-automated, and manual approaches for entity mapping and completion, with evaluation of accuracy rates for each approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the accuracy of automatic entity mapping between DHBB and Wikidata be improved beyond the current 51% for thematic entries and 38% for biographical entries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that 16-34% of automatically mapped entries are incorrect and discusses various disambiguation challenges.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but doesn't propose specific solutions for improving the mapping accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of different NLP techniques, disambiguation strategies, and hybrid human-AI approaches for entity mapping, showing improved accuracy rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the most effective way to structure and query a knowledge graph combining DHBB and Wikidata for Brazilian historical research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for "queries and reasoning over" the combined information but doesn't address implementation details.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on entity mapping but doesn't discuss the subsequent steps of knowledge graph construction, structuring, and querying.
- What evidence would resolve it: A prototype knowledge graph implementation showing query capabilities, reasoning examples, and evaluation of its usefulness for historical research tasks.

## Limitations

- Small manual evaluation sample size (100 entries out of 7,863 total) limits generalizability
- Unclear methodology for determining correct/incorrect mappings in human evaluation
- No systematic verification that Wikidata actually lacks the entities rather than having them under different names or formats
- Limited exploration of alternative mapping strategies beyond wikimapper

## Confidence

- Claim about 51% thematic and 38% biographical mapping success: Medium confidence
- Claim about 30% of unmapped entries being findable by humans: Medium confidence  
- Claim about 16-34% incorrect automated mappings: Medium confidence
- Claim about Wikidata's incompleteness regarding Brazilian historical entities: Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. Expand manual evaluation to 500+ random entries across all categories to establish more robust accuracy metrics and identify systematic mapping patterns
2. Conduct systematic searches for the top 100 most frequent unmapped DHBB entities using multiple search strategies (Wikidata API, Google, Wikipedia) to verify whether they truly don't exist or are just difficult to find
3. Implement a blinded manual evaluation where multiple reviewers independently assess the same sample of mappings to establish inter-rater reliability and refine evaluation criteria
