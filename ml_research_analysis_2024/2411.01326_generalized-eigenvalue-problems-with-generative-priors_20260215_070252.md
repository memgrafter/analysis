# Generalized Eigenvalue Problems with Generative Priors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01326
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01326
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proves optimal statistical rate O(√(k log L)/m) and proposes PRFM algorithm with linear convergence for generalized eigenvalue problems under generative priors

## Executive Summary
This paper studies generalized eigenvalue problems where the solution is constrained to lie in the range of a Lipschitz continuous generative model. The authors establish that optimal solutions achieve the statistical rate O(√(k log L)/m) under appropriate conditions, where k is the latent dimension, L is the Lipschitz constant, and m is the number of observations. They propose the Projected Rayleigh Flow Method (PRFM), an iterative algorithm that combines gradient ascent with projection onto the generative model's range, achieving linear convergence to solutions with optimal statistical rates. Experiments on MNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The method involves solving a generalized eigenvalue problem max u⊤Au/(u⊤Bu) where the solution u is constrained to lie in the range of an L-Lipschitz continuous generative model G: R^k → R^n. The PRFM algorithm iteratively updates an estimate by computing the Rayleigh quotient approximation, performing gradient ascent on the difference (A - ρt B), and projecting the result back onto the generative model's range. The projection is implemented approximately using gradient descent with Adam optimizer. The method assumes the true solution v* lies in R(G) and that perturbation matrices satisfy certain boundedness conditions.

## Key Results
- Proves optimal statistical rate O(√(k log L)/m) for any optimal solution to the constrained GGEP
- Establishes linear convergence of PRFM under conditions on step size η and problem parameters
- Demonstrates superior cosine similarity performance on MNIST and CelebA datasets compared to PPower and Rifle methods
- Shows the algorithm is robust to representation error when v* is approximately in R(G)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PRFM achieves optimal statistical rate O(√(k log L)/m) by combining gradient ascent with projection onto generative model's range
- Mechanism: Alternates between Rayleigh quotient computation and gradient ascent with projection, maintaining iterates within generative model's range
- Core assumption: Projection step can be performed accurately (theoretically exact, practically approximated)
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states PRFM converges linearly to achieve optimal statistical rate; Algorithm description shows gradient ascent followed by projection
- Break condition: If projection cannot be performed accurately, convergence guarantees may fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Global optimal solutions achieve optimal statistical rate because underlying signal lies in generative model's range
- Mechanism: Problem structure ensures any optimal solution is close to true signal v* when v* ∈ R(G)
- Core assumption: Leading generalized eigenvector v* lies within range of generative model G
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions optimal solutions attain optimal statistical rate; Theorem 3.1 extension discusses representation error
- Break condition: If v* ∉ R(G) or perturbations violate assumptions, statistical rate may degrade

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linear convergence achieved by maintaining monotonic distance decrease under specific γ1, γ2 conditions
- Mechanism: Update rule creates contraction mapping when step size and parameter conditions are satisfied
- Core assumption: γ1 + γ2 < 2 and initial vector satisfies certain bounds
- Evidence anchors: Section details conditions for linear convergence with specific parameter relationships
- Break condition: If conditions on γ1, γ2, or initial vector are violated, linear convergence may not be achieved

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs)
  - Why needed here: Entire paper built around solving GEPs under generative priors, extending classical eigenvalue theory
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between max u⊤Au/(u⊤Bu) and Av = λBv?

- Concept: Generative Models and Lipschitz Continuity
  - Why needed here: Solution assumed to lie in range of L-Lipschitz continuous generative model, crucial for statistical guarantees
  - Quick check question: How does Lipschitz constant L affect sample complexity requirements?

- Concept: Statistical Learning Theory and Sample Complexity
  - Why needed here: Establishes statistical rates of convergence and sample requirements for accuracy
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between statistical and computational rates of convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Generative model G -> Approximate matrices ˆA, ˆB -> PRFM algorithm -> Projection operation PG(·)
- Critical path: Iterative loop: compute ρt → gradient (ˆA - ρtˆB)ut → projection PG(·) → update ut+1
- Design tradeoffs: Projection accuracy vs. computational cost, step size η affects convergence speed/stability, generative model choice affects expressiveness/Lipschitz constant
- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction quality, slow convergence/oscillation, sensitivity to initialization, failure to meet statistical rate bounds
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement PRFM on synthetic data with known ground truth to verify convergence rates
  2. Compare PRFM vs. PPower and Rifle on MNIST with varying m to validate statistical claims
  3. Test sensitivity to projection accuracy by varying gradient descent steps in projection approximation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can linear convergence rate of PRFM be established under weaker assumptions, particularly relaxing initial vector alignment condition?
- Basis in paper: Theorem requires non-trivial initial alignment condition that may be difficult to satisfy
- Why unresolved: Proof relies heavily on maintaining monotonically decreasing error sequence requiring specific initial conditions
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis showing sublinear convergence without strict initial alignment, or experimental validation under relaxed initialization

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does PRFM performance scale with generative model depth as Lipschitz constant L grows?
- Basis in paper: Statistical rate depends on √(k log L)/m, with L = n^Θ(ℓ) for ℓ-layer networks
- Why unresolved: Paper establishes L dependence but doesn't quantify practical performance degradation with depth
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying model depth while measuring reconstruction quality, or theoretical bounds on convergence rate degradation

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can PRFM be extended to estimate multiple generalized eigenvectors or entire subspace they span?
- Basis in paper: Conclusion mentions this as future research area, current algorithm only addresses leading eigenvector
- Why unresolved: Current Rayleigh quotient maximization approach targets single eigenvector, requiring modifications for multiple eigenvectors
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified algorithm estimating multiple eigenvectors under generative priors with theoretical subspace recovery guarantees

## Limitations

- Projection operation assumed exact in theory but only approximated in practice, with unclear impact on convergence guarantees
- Performance sensitivity to generative model architecture and training quality not fully characterized
- Extension to cases with representation error requires further empirical validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Optimal statistical rate O(√(k log L)/m) for optimal solutions under stated assumptions; convergence conditions for PRFM are mathematically well-established

**Medium Confidence:** Practical performance of PRFM in real-world image reconstruction given gap between theoretical assumptions and practical implementation

**Low Confidence:** Precise relationship between number of projection steps in practice and theoretical convergence guarantees

## Next Checks

1. **Projection Accuracy Analysis:** Systematically vary projection steps and measure impact on convergence speed and reconstruction quality to establish minimum accuracy required for theoretical guarantees

2. **Representation Error Robustness:** Test PRFM when v* is deliberately outside R(G) to quantify degradation in statistical rate and validate Theorem 3.1 extension

3. **Step Size Sensitivity:** Conduct grid search over η parameter and measure effects on convergence speed and solution quality to establish robust hyperparameter ranges
