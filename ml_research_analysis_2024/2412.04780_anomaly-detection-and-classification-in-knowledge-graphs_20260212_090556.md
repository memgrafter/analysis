# Anomaly Detection and Classification in Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04780
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SEKA and TAXO detect and classify anomalies in KGs with high precision and recall, outperforming baseline methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SEKA (Structure and Entity Knowledge Anomaly detection) and TAXO (Taxonomy of Anomalies) as novel approaches for detecting and classifying anomalies in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). SEKA employs a Corroborative Path Algorithm (CPA) to extract structural features from paths in the KG and content-based features from literal values, which are then used to train a one-class SVM for identifying anomalous triples and entities. TAXO provides a taxonomy of anomaly types, classifying them based on triple type (entity-based, literal-based, or both) and the number of triples involved (single or multiple). The approach was evaluated on four real-world KGs and demonstrated superior performance in precision and recall compared to baseline methods, while also improving the quality of Knowledge Graph Completion tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines structural and content-based feature extraction with a one-class SVM classifier. SEKA generates structural features through the Corroborative Path Algorithm, which identifies patterns in the KG's path structure, and content-based features from literal values associated with entities. These features are used to train a one-class SVM to distinguish between normal and anomalous triples and entities. TAXO provides a systematic classification of detected anomalies based on their characteristics, categorizing them as entity-based, literal-based, or both, and further distinguishing between single and multiple triple anomalies. The method was evaluated on four real-world KGs: YAGO-1, KBpedia, Wikidata, and DSKG.

## Key Results
- SEKA outperformed baseline methods in precision and recall for anomaly detection
- TAXO provides a systematic taxonomy of anomaly types based on triple characteristics
- Anomaly detection improved the quality of Knowledge Graph Completion tasks
- The approach was validated on four real-world KGs: YAGO-1, KBpedia, Wikidata, and DSKG

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of SEKA stems from its dual approach to feature extraction. The Corroborative Path Algorithm captures the structural relationships and patterns within the KG, identifying anomalies that deviate from normal path configurations. Simultaneously, content-based features from literal values provide additional context about entity attributes. This combination allows the one-class SVM to build a comprehensive model of normal behavior, making it more effective at identifying anomalies that might be missed by structural or content-based approaches alone.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**: Structured representations of information where entities are nodes and relationships are edges. Why needed: Understanding KGs is fundamental to grasping the context of anomaly detection. Quick check: Can identify entities, relationships, and literals in a given KG example.

2. **One-class SVM**: A machine learning model trained on only one class of data to identify outliers. Why needed: The core classification algorithm for distinguishing normal from anomalous data. Quick check: Understand the difference between one-class and traditional binary SVMs.

3. **Corroborative Path Algorithm**: A method for extracting structural features by analyzing paths in the KG. Why needed: Provides the structural feature set for anomaly detection. Quick check: Can explain how path patterns contribute to anomaly detection.

4. **Knowledge Graph Completion**: The task of predicting missing links or entities in a KG. Why needed: Demonstrates the practical application and benefit of anomaly detection. Quick check: Understand how anomaly detection can improve link prediction accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Knowledge Graph -> Corroborative Path Algorithm -> Structural Features -> One-class SVM -> Anomaly Detection
                                  -> Content-based Features (from literals) -> Anomaly Detection

Critical path: The most critical components are the Corroborative Path Algorithm for structural feature extraction and the one-class SVM for classification. The CPA must efficiently identify meaningful path patterns, while the SVM must effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous data using the combined feature set.

Design tradeoffs: The approach balances between structural and content-based features, requiring careful feature engineering and selection. The one-class SVM assumes that normal data is more common than anomalies, which may not always hold true in real-world KGs.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include:
- High false positive rates if the CPA overfits to specific path patterns
- Poor generalization if the feature space is not representative of diverse KG structures
- Reduced effectiveness in KGs with sparse literals or limited path diversity

3 first experiments:
1. Run SEKA on a small, well-understood KG with known anomalies to validate basic functionality
2. Perform ablation studies by testing SEKA with only structural features, only content-based features, and both combined
3. Evaluate TAXO's taxonomy classification on a curated dataset with manually labeled anomaly types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is limited to four specific KGs, raising questions about generalizability to other KGs with different characteristics, sizes, or domains
- Unclear how SEKA and TAXO compare to the most recent state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques in KGs
- The TAXO taxonomy's comprehensiveness in capturing all possible anomaly types in KGs is uncertain

## Confidence
- SEKA's effectiveness in anomaly detection: High
- TAXO's taxonomy of anomalies: Medium
- Improvement of KG completion tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Expand evaluation to diverse KGs: Test SEKA and TAXO on a wider range of KGs with varying sizes, domains, and structures to assess their generalizability and robustness

2. Compare with state-of-the-art methods: Conduct a comprehensive comparison between SEKA/TAXO and the latest anomaly detection techniques in KGs, including those mentioned in the related work section

3. Perform ablation studies: Investigate the individual contributions of SEKA's components (CPA, content-based features) and TAXO's taxonomy elements to better understand their impact on overall performance and identify potential areas for improvement
