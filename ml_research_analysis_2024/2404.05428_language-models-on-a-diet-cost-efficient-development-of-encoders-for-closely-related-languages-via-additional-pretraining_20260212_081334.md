# Language Models on a Diet: Cost-Efficient Development of Encoders for Closely-Related Languages via Additional Pretraining

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.05428
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05428
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Additional pretraining of multilingual models can achieve comparable performance to from-scratch models for closely-related languages with limited computational resources.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates cost-effective methods for developing encoder models for closely-related languages, specifically focusing on Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. The study compares models trained from scratch with those created through additional pretraining of existing multilingual models. The authors find that comparable performance to dedicated from-scratch models can be achieved by additionally pretraining available multilingual models, even with limited computational resources. Furthermore, they demonstrate that including a neighboring language, such as Slovenian, in the additional pretraining process results in little to no loss in performance.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a systematic comparison between models trained from scratch and those created through additional pretraining of existing multilingual models. They evaluate performance on various downstream tasks and analyze the computational efficiency of each approach. The study also investigates the impact of including related languages (specifically Slovenian) during the additional pretraining phase to assess potential performance trade-offs.

## Key Results
- Additional pretraining of multilingual models can achieve comparable performance to from-scratch models for closely-related languages.
- Including neighboring languages like Slovenian in the pretraining process results in minimal performance degradation.
- Cost-efficient development is possible with limited computational resources while maintaining competitive performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of additional pretraining for closely-related languages stems from the shared linguistic features and vocabulary across these languages. Multilingual models already possess general language understanding capabilities that can be fine-tuned for specific language variants through targeted pretraining. The linguistic proximity allows for efficient knowledge transfer, requiring less data and computational resources compared to training from scratch.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Language relatedness and transfer learning**
   - Why needed: Understanding how linguistic similarities enable knowledge transfer between related languages
   - Quick check: Compare vocabulary overlap and grammatical structures across target languages

2. **Pretraining vs. from-scratch training efficiency**
   - Why needed: Quantifying computational and data efficiency gains from leveraging existing models
   - Quick check: Measure training time, data requirements, and performance metrics for both approaches

3. **Multilingual model adaptation**
   - Why needed: Understanding how multilingual models can be specialized for specific language variants
   - Quick check: Analyze parameter updates and performance changes during additional pretraining

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Raw text data -> Pretraining (multilingual model) -> Additional pretraining (target language) -> Evaluation (downstream tasks)

**Critical path**: The most critical components are the quality and quantity of pretraining data, the choice of base multilingual model, and the specific pretraining objectives used during the additional pretraining phase.

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- From-scratch training offers complete control but requires substantial resources
- Additional pretraining leverages existing knowledge but may inherit biases from the base model
- Including related languages can improve generalization but may dilute language-specific features

**Failure signatures**: 
- Performance plateaus or degrades when the base model is too dissimilar from target languages
- Overfitting occurs with insufficient pretraining data
- Language-specific features get diluted when including too many related languages

**First experiments**:
1. Compare baseline performance of from-scratch vs. additional pretraining models on a small set of downstream tasks
2. Test different ratios of target language to related language data in the additional pretraining process
3. Evaluate the impact of pretraining duration on final model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on general downstream tasks without detailed domain-specific performance analysis
- Computational cost comparisons lack granularity in terms of wall-clock time and energy consumption metrics
- Analysis of neighbor language inclusion doesn't fully explore optimal ratios of target vs. related language data for pretraining

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence:**
- **High confidence**: The core finding that additional pretraining of multilingual models can match from-scratch performance for closely-related languages is well-supported by the experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that including neighboring languages causes little to no performance loss, while demonstrated, would benefit from testing with a wider range of related languages and varying pretraining data ratios.
- **Medium confidence**: The cost-efficiency claims are reasonable but would be strengthened by more detailed energy consumption measurements and wall-clock time comparisons.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies with different ratios of target language to related language data in the additional pretraining process to identify optimal mixing strategies.
2. Evaluate model performance across domain-specific benchmarks to assess whether the cost-efficiency benefits hold for specialized applications.
3. Measure and report comprehensive energy consumption metrics and wall-clock training times to provide more detailed cost-efficiency analysis.
