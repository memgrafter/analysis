# On the Foundations of Conflict-Driven Solving for Hybrid MKNF Knowledge Bases

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.09626
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09626
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: This work establishes the theoretical foundation for conflict-driven solving of Hybrid MKNF Knowledge Bases (HMKNF-KBs), defining completion and loop formulas that characterize MKNF models through nogoods, and proving their equivalence to K-interpretations induced by MKNF models.

## Executive Summary
This paper lays the theoretical groundwork for conflict-driven solving of Hybrid MKNF Knowledge Bases (HMKNF-KBs), which integrate closed-world rules with open-world ontologies. The authors develop completion and loop formulas that completely characterize MKNF models in terms of K-interpretations, leading to sets of nogoods that capture constraints on these interpretations. These nogoods form the basis for a conflict-driven algorithm that extends techniques from SAT and ASP solving. The main theoretical result establishes that a K-interpretation is induced by an MKNF model if and only if it satisfies the completion and loop formulas, which is equivalent to the induced assignment being a solution to the corresponding nogoods.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing a dependency graph for the HMKNF-KB, then formulating completion and loop formulas based on this graph. These formulas are translated into nogoods that characterize valid K-interpretations induced by MKNF models. A conflict-driven algorithm is then built using these nogoods, following the general approach of existing SAT and ASP solvers. The method relies on procedures like NogoodProp for propagating nogoods, EntNogoods for adding nogoods based on ontology entailment, and UnfoundedSet for identifying unfounded sets that require loop nogoods.

## Key Results
- Theorem 2: A K-interpretation is induced by an MKNF model if and only if it satisfies both completion and loop formulas
- Theorem 3: The induced assignment of a K-interpretation is a solution to the completion and loop nogoods if and only if the K-interpretation satisfies the completion and loop formulas
- Theorem 4: A K-interpretation is induced by an MKNF model if and only if its induced assignment is a solution to the completion and loop nogoods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The completion and loop formulas provide a complete characterization of MKNF models in terms of K-interpretations.
- Mechanism: The formulas ensure that a K-interpretation corresponds to an MKNF model if and only if it satisfies both the completion and loop formulas, establishing a sound and complete mapping between the two representations.
- Core assumption: The dependency graph G(K) accurately overapproximates the semantic dependencies in the HMKNF-KB.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The main theoretical result is that a K-interpretation is induced by an MKNF model if and only if it satisfies the completion and loop formulas"
  - [section]: "Theorem 2: For any K-interpretation ˆI, of an HMKNF-KB K = (P,O), ˆI|=Kcomp( ˆI)∧K loop( ˆI), if and only if, K has an MKNF model M such that M induces ˆI."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus about completeness of these formulas.
- Break condition: If the dependency graph does not correctly overapproximate semantic dependencies, the formulas may miss valid models or include invalid ones.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Nogoods derived from completion and loop formulas can be used to guide a conflict-driven search algorithm.
- Mechanism: The nogoods encode constraints that any
