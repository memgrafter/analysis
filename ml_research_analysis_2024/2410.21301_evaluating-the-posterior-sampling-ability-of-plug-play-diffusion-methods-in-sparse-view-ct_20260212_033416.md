# Evaluating the Posterior Sampling Ability of Plug&Play Diffusion Methods in Sparse-View CT

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: This paper addresses the problem of evaluating the posterior sampling ability of Plug&Play diffusion models in sparse-view CT, specifically when the posterior distribution is not concentrated or even multimodal.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates the posterior sampling ability of Plug&Play (PnP) diffusion methods in sparse-view CT reconstruction, focusing on scenarios where the posterior distribution becomes non-peaked or multimodal. The authors introduce two evaluation properties - Posterior-Prior Similarity (PPS) using FID and CMMD metrics, and Normalized average Measurement Consistency (NMC) - to quantitatively assess how well different PnP methods approximate the true posterior. The study tests three state-of-the-art methods (MCG, DPS, and ΠG) across three datasets with varying numbers of projections from p = 1 to p = 180.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce two key posterior evaluation properties: Posterior-Prior Similarity (PPS) using FID and CMMD metrics, and Normalized average Measurement Consistency (NMC). They quantitatively evaluate three state-of-the-art PnP diffusion methods (MCG, DPS, and ΠG) on three different datasets (JET, LDCT, and LIDC) for several numbers of projections ranging from p = 1 to p = 180. The evaluation focuses on sparse-view CT reconstruction where the posterior distribution becomes non-peaked or multimodal.

## Key Results
- For each method, the approximate posterior deviates from the true posterior when the number of projections decreases
- DPS's approximate posterior is much closer to the true posterior than MCG and ΠG, despite using a simpler and faster approximation
- Best performance is achieved with DPS, particularly for higher numbers of projections
- The study reveals that posterior sampling quality degrades significantly as projection count decreases in sparse-view CT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of Plug&Play diffusion methods in sparse-view CT stems from their ability to separate the denoising process from data consistency enforcement. By using a pre-trained diffusion model as a prior, these methods can generate plausible reconstructions while maintaining measurement consistency through iterative updates. The study suggests that DPS achieves superior performance because its simpler approximation better captures the essential features of the true posterior without overfitting to the sparse measurements. The FID and CMMD metrics effectively measure how well the approximate posterior matches the true posterior's statistical properties, while NMC ensures the reconstructed images remain faithful to the actual CT measurements.

## Foundational Learning
- Posterior distribution in CT: Understanding how limited projections create non-peaked or multimodal posteriors is crucial for evaluating reconstruction methods
- FID and CMMD metrics: These metrics are needed to quantify the similarity between approximate and true posteriors
- Measurement consistency: Critical for ensuring reconstructed images align with actual CT measurements
- Sparse-view CT challenges: Recognizing how few projections create ill-posed inverse problems requiring careful posterior sampling
- Plug&Play diffusion framework: Understanding how these methods separate denoising from data consistency steps
- Posterior evaluation properties: PPS and NMC provide quantitative frameworks for assessing reconstruction quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
CT Sinogram -> PnP Diffusion Method (MCG/DPS/ΠG) -> Reconstructed Image -> Evaluation (PPS, NMC)

**Critical Path:**
Sinogram acquisition -> Denoising step (diffusion model) -> Data consistency enforcement -> Posterior evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational complexity vs. reconstruction quality
- Speed of approximation vs. accuracy of posterior sampling
- Simplicity of method (DPS) vs. potential performance gains from more complex approaches

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor posterior sampling at low projection counts
- Deviation between approximate and true posteriors
- Inconsistent measurement adherence

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare PPS scores across all three methods for p = 1 projections
2. Evaluate NMC consistency for each method at p = 180 projections
3. Test computational runtime differences between DPS and MCG methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do different PnP diffusion methods compare in terms of their ability to capture complex posterior distributions in sparse-view CT?
- What are the fundamental limitations of current evaluation metrics (PPS and NMC) in assessing posterior sampling quality?
- How can the computational efficiency of PnP methods be improved while maintaining high reconstruction quality?

## Limitations
- Focuses primarily on quantitative metrics without extensive qualitative assessment
- Examines only three PnP diffusion methods, potentially missing other relevant approaches
- Limited computational cost analysis and practical implementation considerations
- Doesn't deeply explore underlying reasons for posterior deviation at low projection counts
