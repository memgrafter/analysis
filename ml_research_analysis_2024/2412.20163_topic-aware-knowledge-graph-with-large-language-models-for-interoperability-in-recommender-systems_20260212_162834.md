# Topic-Aware Knowledge Graph with Large Language Models for Interoperability in Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20163
- Authors: Minhye Jeon; Seokho Ahn; Young-Duk Seo
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Improves NDCG@10 from 2.518% to 5.517% and Recall@10 from 3.934% to 8.560% on Amazon Beauty dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a method to enhance knowledge graphs for recommender systems using large language models (LLMs) to extract general and specific topics from side and context information. The approach addresses data sparsity and cold start problems by iteratively extracting general topics from side information, extracting specific topics from context information, and refining synonymous topics generated during extraction. Experiments on Amazon Beauty and Clothing datasets demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation performance metrics compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The method involves three main components: (1) iterative extraction of general topics from side information using both side and context information, (2) extraction of specific topics from context information (descriptions and reviews) to capture detailed item attributes and user preferences, and (3) refining synonymous topics using a partitioning algorithm and LLM-based semantic grouping. The approach enhances existing knowledge graphs with topic entities while maintaining interoperability through standardized metagraph design. The system is evaluated using the PGPR model on Amazon datasets, measuring performance improvements in NDCG@10, Recall@10, HR@10, and Precision@10 metrics.

## Key Results
- NDCG@10 increases from 2.518% to 5.517% on Amazon Beauty dataset
- Recall@10 improves from 3.934% to 8.560% on Amazon Beauty dataset
- NDCG@10 increases from 0.827% to 3.026% and Recall@10 from 1.609% to 5.105% on Amazon Clothing dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Iterative extraction and update of general topics from side and context information leads to broader knowledge capture than using side information alone. The approach first uses both side and context information to extract general topics, then iteratively updates these topics by incorporating them into subsequent extractions for items at the same lowest level in the type tree.

### Mechanism 2
Extracting specific topics from context information captures detailed item attributes and user preferences that side information cannot provide. For each item, the approach extracts specific topics from both descriptions (objective) and user reviews (subjective), creating distinct relations between entities.

### Mechanism 3
The refining algorithm resolves synonymous topics generated during specific topic extraction while maintaining interoperability. The algorithm partitions candidate topics by morphological similarity, then uses LLMs to semantically group synonyms within each partition, replacing less frequent terms with more common ones.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Construction
  - Why needed here: The approach builds upon and extends existing knowledge graphs with topic entities, requiring understanding of graph structure and entity relations
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a knowledge graph in recommender systems, and how do they differ from traditional graph structures?

- Concept: Large Language Model Prompt Engineering
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on carefully crafted prompts to extract general and specific topics, requiring understanding of effective prompt design
  - Quick check question: How would you structure a prompt to extract descriptive keywords from product descriptions while avoiding numerical information?

- Concept: Interoperability in Recommender Systems
  - Why needed here: The approach uses a standardized metagraph to ensure consistent application across different systems, requiring understanding of standardization principles
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when integrating knowledge graphs across different recommender systems, and how does standardization address them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Layer (Existing knowledge graphs, side information, context information) → Processing Layer (General topic extraction, specific topic extraction, topic refining algorithm) → Output Layer (Enhanced knowledge graphs with topic entities) → LLM Integration (Prompt-based topic extraction and synonym resolution) → Evaluation Layer (Performance metrics)
- Critical path: Side/context information → General topic extraction → Specific topic extraction → Topic refining → Enhanced knowledge graph → Improved recommendations
- Design tradeoffs: Broader topic coverage vs. computational complexity; LLM token limits vs. comprehensive synonym resolution; standardization vs. domain-specific optimization
- Failure signatures: No improvement in NDCG@10 or Recall@10 metrics; Excessive synonymous topics in the knowledge graph; LLM processing errors or timeouts; Knowledge graph size explosion without performance gains
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Gbase (enhanced with topics) against Gbase (baseline) on Amazon Beauty dataset, measuring NDCG@10 improvement
  2. Test the refining algorithm with synthetic synonymous topics to verify synonym resolution accuracy
  3. Vary the partitioning threshold (T) in the refining algorithm to find optimal balance between processing time and synonym coverage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the proposed approach scale when applied to knowledge graphs with significantly larger numbers of entities and relations, particularly in domains with more complex item characteristics? The paper demonstrates improvements on Amazon Beauty and Clothing datasets but does not explore scalability to larger, more complex knowledge graphs.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal threshold value T for partitioning specific candidate topics in the TopicPartition algorithm, and how does this threshold affect recommendation performance across different domains? The paper mentions a threshold T is used but does not empirically evaluate how different threshold values impact performance.

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed approach compare to other LLM-based knowledge graph enhancement methods that use different strategies for context information integration? The paper compares against PGPR and knowledge graphs with different combinations of side and context information, but does not benchmark against other contemporary LLM-based approaches.

## Limitations

- Token budget constraints may prevent complete resolution of synonymous topics in large knowledge graphs
- Effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and informativeness of user reviews and descriptions
- Performance gains were demonstrated primarily on Amazon Beauty and Clothing datasets, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The iterative extraction mechanism for general topics (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by experimental results showing consistent improvements
- Medium Confidence: The synonym refinement algorithm (Mechanism 3) demonstrates effectiveness, though token limit constraints introduce uncertainty about scalability
- Low Confidence: The assumption that context information universally provides unique semantic features not captured in side information (Mechanism 2) lacks comprehensive validation across diverse domains

## Next Checks

1. Test the approach on datasets from domains with different review characteristics (e.g., electronics, books, or services) to verify generalizability of performance improvements
2. Systematically evaluate how varying the partition threshold T affects both synonym resolution completeness and processing time across knowledge graphs of different sizes
3. Conduct an ablation study comparing performance when using only side information, only context information, and both to quantify the marginal contribution of context-dependent specific topics
