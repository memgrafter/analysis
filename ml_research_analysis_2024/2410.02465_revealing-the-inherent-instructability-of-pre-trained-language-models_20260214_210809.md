# Revealing the Inherent Instructability of Pre-Trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02465
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02465
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Pre-trained LLMs can follow instructions and exhibit safety behaviors without explicit instruction-response mapping supervision through Response Tuning

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether pre-trained large language models (LLMs) inherently possess instruction-following capabilities that can be leveraged without explicit instruction-response mapping supervision. The authors propose Response Tuning (RT), a method that trains models using only response data while omitting instruction conditioning. Through extensive experiments with multiple LLMs and datasets, they demonstrate that RT models can effectively respond to diverse instructions and achieve performance comparable to instruction-tuned counterparts. The research suggests that alignment can be achieved by establishing appropriate response spaces rather than requiring paired instruction-response supervision.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Response Tuning (RT), a novel fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs using only response tokens from instruction datasets, omitting the instruction conditioning step entirely. Unlike traditional instruction tuning that pairs instructions with responses, RT extracts only the response portions (after the <|assistant|> token) and uses these as training data. The method is evaluated across multiple base models (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-2 variants, Mistral-7B) and datasets (Alpaca, Dolly, LIMA), with comparisons against standard instruction-tuned models. The approach leverages QLoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning and explores how controlling the response distribution can achieve both quality and safety objectives.

## Key Results
- RT models trained solely on responses can effectively follow instructions and achieve human-acceptable response quality comparable to instruction-tuned models
- Refining structural attributes of training responses (clarity, structure, tone) significantly improves user preference for RT models
- Incorporating contextual refusals into RT data enables models to implicitly learn safety behaviors and reject unsafe queries without explicit instruction-response supervision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained LLMs inherently acquire instruction-following capabilities during pre-training
- Mechanism: Extensive self-supervised learning on diverse web data allows models to implicitly learn task execution patterns, enabling them to understand and respond to instructions without explicit instruction-response mapping supervision
- Core assumption: Knowledge and capabilities required for instruction-following are acquired during pre-training, not just through fine-tuning
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We hypothesize that the pre-training stage can enable them to develop the ability to comprehend and address instructions." [section] "These findings suggest that instruction-following capabilities are largely acquired during pre-training and that establishing an appropriate response space can yield instruction-following assistants."
- Break condition: If pre-trained models cannot demonstrate instruction-following capabilities without any instruction-response supervision, this mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Establishing appropriate response distribution alone can enable instruction-following behavior
- Mechanism: By training models only on response tokens without instruction conditioning, the model learns the statistical patterns and structures of helpful responses, which it can then apply when generating outputs for new instructions
- Core assumption: The response distribution contains sufficient information about how to structure helpful responses, even without seeing the paired instructions
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our experiments demonstrate that RT models, trained only on responses, can effectively respond to a wide range of instructions akin to their instruction-tuned counterparts." [section] "Our extensive evaluations show that RT models, trained solely using responses, can effectively respond to a wide range of instructions."
- Break condition: If models trained only on responses fail to generate appropriate outputs for instructions, this mechanism breaks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Controlling training response distribution can achieve target alignment objectives
- Mechanism: By refining structural attributes of responses (clarity, structure, tone) or incorporating contextual refusals, models learn to generate outputs that match desired behavioral patterns without explicit instruction-response supervision
- Core assumption: The model can generalize from the refined response distribution to new instructions, producing outputs with the desired properties
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "controlling the response distribution—such as refining response attributes or incorporating contextual refusals—significantly improves user preference and safety." [section] "we observe that refining the structural attributes of the training responses leads to significant improvements in user preference" and "incorporating a small set of contextual refusals...into the RT data allows RT models to implicitly evaluate and reject unsafe queries."
- Break condition: If models cannot generalize the behavioral guidance embedded in the response distribution to new instructions, this mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning through next-token prediction
  - Why needed here: This is the foundation of how pre-trained LLMs acquire their capabilities, which the paper argues is sufficient for instruction-following
  - Quick check question: What training objective do LLMs use during pre-training to acquire their knowledge and capabilities?

- Concept: Statistical learning of response patterns
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument is that models can learn how to respond helpfully by observing response distributions, not just instruction-response pairs
  - Quick check question: How does a model learn to generate helpful responses when trained only on response tokens without seeing the instructions?

- Concept: Generalization from limited demonstrations
  - Why needed here: The paper shows that models can generalize behavioral guidance (like refusing unsafe queries) from a small number of examples in the response distribution
  - Quick check question: How can a model learn to refuse unsafe queries when trained only on a small number of refusal responses mixed into the training data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base LLM → Response-only fine-tuning (RT) → Instruction-following capability without explicit instruction-response supervision
- Critical path: Pre-training → Response distribution establishment → Instruction-following capability → Alignment through response control
- Design tradeoffs: RT sacrifices explicit instruction conditioning for reduced supervision requirements, potentially at the cost of some instruction-following precision compared to IT
- Failure signatures: If RT models cannot generate appropriate responses to instructions, fail to generalize behavioral guidance, or perform worse than IT models on core capabilities
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare RT vs IT models on human acceptability of responses to diverse instructions
  2. Evaluate RT vs IT models on core capability benchmarks (MMLU, ARC, GSM8K, PIQA)
  3. Test safety alignment by measuring refusal rates for unsafe queries in RT vs IT models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do different pre-training objectives (e.g., masked language modeling, causal language modeling, contrastive learning) affect the inherent instructability of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that pre-trained LLMs can follow instructions without explicit instruction-response mapping, but does not investigate whether different pre-training objectives impact this inherent capability.
- Why unresolved: The study uses models trained with causal language modeling (CLM) objectives and shows their instructability, but does not compare models with different pre-training objectives to determine if some objectives better instill instruction-following capabilities during pre-training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of RT models derived from pre-trained models with different objectives (CLM, MLM, contrastive) on the same instructability benchmarks, measuring both response quality and preference metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the minimum amount of response data needed to elicit instruction-following capabilities in RT models, and does this scale with model size?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that RT models can follow instructions using only response data, but does not explore the minimum dataset size required or how this requirement changes with model scale.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that instruction-following emerges from response supervision alone, it does not systematically investigate how much response data is necessary for different model sizes, which has implications for efficiency and resource requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying the amount of response data (both absolute size and proportion relative to instruction data) across different model scales, measuring the point at which RT performance plateaus or approaches IT performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do RT models generalize to completely novel instruction types that were not represented in their response training data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows RT models can handle a wide range of instructions but does not test their ability to generalize to instruction types entirely absent from their training data.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation uses test instructions derived from existing datasets, which may share patterns with training responses, but does not assess whether RT models can truly generalize to unseen instruction categories or reasoning types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of RT models on instruction categories completely absent from their training data (e.g., testing a model trained on general knowledge responses on complex mathematical reasoning instructions), comparing their zero-shot performance to IT models.

## Limitations

- Evidence primarily comes from controlled experiments with specific model sizes (8B parameters) and curated datasets, which may not generalize to larger models or more diverse data distributions
- Safety evaluation relies on engineered prompts and benchmark datasets that may not capture the full complexity of real-world safety challenges
- Comparison assumes IT represents the gold standard for instruction-following, but this baseline itself has limitations in terms of supervision requirements

## Confidence

- High Confidence: RT models can produce responses that are human-acceptable and comparable to IT models on standard benchmarks (MMLU, ARC, GSM8K, etc.)
- Medium Confidence: Pre-trained LLMs inherently acquire instruction-following capabilities during pre-training that can be leveraged through response-only training
- Medium Confidence: Controlling response distribution can achieve target alignment objectives (safety, quality)

## Next Checks

1. Test RT methodology on larger model architectures (70B+ parameters) to verify whether inherent instructability scales with model size and whether the response distribution approach remains effective at scale

2. Evaluate RT models trained on more diverse and noisy web data (not just curated instruction datasets) to assess whether the inherent instructability claim holds across different data quality levels and distributions

3. Conduct adversarial testing with novel unsafe prompts not present in training data or evaluation benchmarks to verify that RT models' safety behaviors generalize beyond the specific refusal patterns in their training distribution
