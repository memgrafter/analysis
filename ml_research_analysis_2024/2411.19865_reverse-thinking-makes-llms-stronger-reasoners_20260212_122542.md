# Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.19865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework that improves reasoning in LLMs by enabling backward thinking, achieving an average 13.53% improvement over student model's zero-shot performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework designed to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to think backward. The method consists of two stages: data augmentation and multi-task learning. During data augmentation, a teacher LLM generates structured reasoning data including original questions, forward reasoning, backward questions, and backward reasoning. During training, the student model learns three objectives simultaneously: generating forward reasoning, generating backward questions, and generating backward reasoning. This multi-task learning approach enables the student model to internalize backward reasoning during training while maintaining zero-shot inference efficiency at test time.

## Method Summary
RevThink is a framework that enhances LLM reasoning through bidirectional thinking. The method uses a teacher model to generate augmented training data consisting of (Q, Rf, Qb, Rb) tuples where Q is the original question, Rf is forward reasoning, Qb is a backward question (inverse of the original), and Rb is backward reasoning. The student model is trained on three objectives: generating forward reasoning from a question, generating backward questions from original questions, and generating backward reasoning from backward questions. At inference time, only the forward reasoning generation is used, maintaining zero-shot efficiency while benefiting from the enhanced reasoning capabilities learned during training.

## Key Results
- RevThink achieves an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance across 12 datasets
- The method outperforms strongest knowledge distillation baselines by 6.84% on average
- RevThink demonstrates strong sample efficiency, outperforming standard fine-tuning trained on 10x more data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bidirectional reasoning improves consistency checking.
- Mechanism: By training on both forward and backward reasoning, the model learns to detect contradictions between a problem and its proposed solution.
- Core assumption: Many reasoning tasks have an inherent inverse relationship that can be leveraged for validation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking."
  - [section] "Using reverse reasoning, we start with the conclusion that they have five apples. If Emma has two, we can ask: how many does Jack have? The result is three, which matches the original problem and confirms the solution is correct."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only general reasoning enhancement mentioned, not specific to consistency checking.
- Break condition: When the task domain lacks a clear inverse relationship (e.g., number theory problems where backward reasoning doesn't offer much advantage).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task learning of forward reasoning, backward question generation, and backward reasoning creates a more robust reasoning model.
- Mechanism: The model learns three complementary skills simultaneously, each reinforcing the others through shared representations.
- Core assumption: These three objectives are mutually reinforcing rather than competing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance"
  - [section] "Our proposed objectives aim to tie all the components together in a multi-task learning way."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - mentions multi-task learning but doesn't specifically analyze the three-objective approach.
- Break condition: When the auxiliary tasks (backward question generation, backward reasoning) are not well-aligned with the primary task or when the model capacity is insufficient to handle all three objectives effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Learning from backward questions and reasoning improves generalization to out-of-distribution data.
- Mechanism: By learning to invert problems and solve them backward, the model develops a deeper understanding of problem structure rather than memorizing patterns.
- Core assumption: Generalization improves when models understand problem inversion rather than just pattern matching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "REVTHINK also exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets"
  - [section] "REVTHINK shows larger gains on an out-of-domain math dataset, pointing to its stronger generalizability compared to AnsAug."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - mentions generalization but doesn't specifically attribute it to backward reasoning.
- Break condition: When the test data is too different from training distribution, or when the inversion relationship doesn't generalize across domains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: The method builds on CoT by extending it to bidirectional reasoning, requiring understanding of how step-by-step reasoning works
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why showing intermediate reasoning steps helps LLMs solve complex problems better than just answering directly?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: The approach uses a teacher model to generate augmented data that is then distilled to a smaller student model
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between traditional knowledge distillation and the symbolic knowledge distillation used in this work?

- Concept: Multi-task learning
  - Why needed here: The model simultaneously learns three objectives (forward reasoning, backward question generation, backward reasoning) which are all part of the training process
  - Quick check question: Why might training on multiple related tasks simultaneously lead to better performance than training on each task separately?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Teacher model (Gemini-1.5-Pro-001) -> Data augmentation pipeline -> Student model (Mistral-7B or Gemma-7B) -> Three training objectives -> Filtered training data

- Critical path:
  1. Generate forward reasoning from teacher
  2. Filter to keep only correct forward reasoning
  3. Generate backward questions and reasoning
  4. Filter for consistency between forward and backward reasoning
  5. Train student on all three objectives simultaneously
  6. At inference, use only forward reasoning generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using backward reasoning increases training compute but maintains zero-shot inference efficiency
  - Filtering reduces training data size but improves quality
  - Multi-task learning requires careful balancing of three objectives

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on tasks without clear inverse relationships
  - Degradation when backward question generation is incorrect or inconsistent
  - Sample inefficiency if filtering removes too much data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare single-task vs multi-task training to validate the benefit of learning all three objectives
  2. Test the impact of removing the consistency filtering step to measure data quality importance
  3. Evaluate performance on held-out datasets to confirm generalization claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of RevThink vary with different teacher model sizes and capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses Gemini-1.5-Pro-001 as the teacher model but doesn't explore how different teacher models might affect results.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses one teacher model, leaving the impact of teacher model size and capability on RevThink's performance unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing RevThink's performance using different teacher models (e.g., different sizes of Gemini, GPT models) while keeping the student model constant.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different filtering criteria on the quality and quantity of augmented data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions filtering data based on correct forward reasoning and consistency between forward and backward reasoning, but doesn't explore alternative filtering methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a specific filtering approach but doesn't investigate how other filtering criteria might affect the augmented dataset's quality and the student model's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the filtering criteria (e.g., allowing some incorrect forward reasoning, relaxing consistency checks) and measuring their impact on downstream performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does RevThink perform in a continual learning setting where the student model encounters new tasks over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates RevThink on held-out datasets, suggesting some generalization ability, but doesn't test performance in a continual learning scenario.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on static training and evaluation but doesn't explore how well RevThink adapts to new tasks encountered sequentially.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where the student model is trained on an initial set of tasks, then sequentially exposed to new tasks, measuring both performance on new tasks and retention of previously learned tasks.

## Limitations
- The filtering mechanism for data quality is described qualitatively but lacks quantitative analysis of its effectiveness
- The three-objective multi-task learning approach shows improvements but lacks ablation studies to isolate individual contributions
- Generalization claims are based on limited out-of-domain evaluation (only one additional math dataset)

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The bidirectional reasoning framework is technically sound and the implementation details are clearly specified. The core concept of using backward reasoning for consistency checking is well-founded.
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements (13.53% average gain) are based on experiments across 12 datasets, but the relative contribution of each component (multi-task learning, backward reasoning, filtering) remains unclear without proper ablation studies.
- **Low confidence**: The generalization claims are based on limited out-of-domain evaluation. The paper asserts that RevThink generalizes better than baselines, but only tests this on one additional dataset (TabMWP), which is insufficient to establish robust generalization properties.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on multi-task objectives**: Conduct experiments to isolate the contribution of each training objective (forward reasoning, backward question generation, backward reasoning) by testing them individually and in pairs to determine their relative importance.

2. **Comprehensive generalization testing**: Evaluate the model on a broader range of out-of-domain datasets across different reasoning domains (e.g., physics problems, logical puzzles, real-world scenarios) to validate the generalization claims beyond the single additional math dataset.

3. **Data filtering analysis**: Provide quantitative analysis of the filtering process, including statistics on how much data is filtered, the impact on training efficiency, and whether the filtered data differs systematically from retained data in ways that could introduce bias.
