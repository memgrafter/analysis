# FastSpiker: Enabling Fast Training for Spiking Neural Networks on Event-based Data through Learning Rate Enhancements for Autonomous Embedded Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05262
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05262
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Up to 10.5x faster training and 88.39% lower carbon emissions while maintaining high accuracy on NCARS dataset

## Executive Summary
FastSpiker introduces a systematic methodology to accelerate training of spiking neural networks (SNNs) on event-based data through optimized learning rate (LR) policies and parameter settings. The approach first determines an effective LR range by evaluating accuracy across different LR values, then selects and fine-tunes LR policies that reach stability thresholds fastest. Experiments on the NCARS automotive dataset demonstrate significant reductions in training time and carbon emissions compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving comparable or better accuracy.

## Method Summary
FastSpiker is a methodology that accelerates SNN training on event-based data by systematically exploring and optimizing learning rate policies and their parameters. The method involves three main phases: (1) determining an effective LR range through observation of accuracy profiles across different LR values, (2) evaluating multiple LR policies (decreasing step, exponential decay, warm restarts) to select those that quickly achieve high accuracy and stability, and (3) fine-tuning selected policies through statistical decision-making by varying parameters like batch size and membrane threshold potential. The approach is implemented using Python-based code on Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada GPU machines and evaluated on the NCARS automotive dataset with 24K samples.

## Key Results
- Up to 10.5x reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art decreasing step policy
- Up to 88.39% reduction in carbon emissions during training
- Maintained or improved accuracy compared to baseline methods
- Effective LR range identified as 1e-5 to 1e-2 for NCARS dataset
- Stability threshold of 1% standard deviation of last 10 epochs used to determine training completion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Systematic learning rate (LR) range determination accelerates convergence
- Mechanism: FastSpiker first finds the effective LR range by training with varied LR values (1e-6 to 1e-1) and observing accuracy profiles, then fixes the range to 1e-5–1e-2. This avoids ineffective extremes and ensures policies start from an optimal range.
- Core assumption: The optimal LR range for event-based data is consistent across different network architectures and datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In FastSpiker, we first investigate the impact of different learning rate policies and their values..."
  - [section] "To determine the appropriate range of values, a simple yet effective way is by performing observations through network training that considers different LR values from small to large ones...These results show that the LR value should not be too small (e.g., 1e-6) or too big (i.e., 1e-1), since they lead to ineffective learning process."
  - [corpus] No direct support found; anchor is paper-internal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Policy selection based on early stability accelerates training
- Mechanism: FastSpiker evaluates multiple LR policies (e.g., exponential decay, warm restarts) and selects those that reach a stability threshold (1% std dev of last 10 epochs) fastest. Early stability reduces wasted epochs in parameter exploration.
- Core assumption: A lower fluctuation threshold reliably indicates readiness to stop training without sacrificing accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...we first investigate the impact of different learning rate policies and their values, then select the ones that quickly offer high accuracy."
  - [section] "Here, we consider the training phase complete when the accuracy scores do not exceed the defined stability threshold value (accth) anymore..."
  - [corpus] No direct support found; threshold choice appears paper-internal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parameter tuning via statistical variance-based decision improves LR policy performance
- Mechanism: FastSpiker varies parameters like batch size (B) and membrane threshold (Vth) across combinations, then uses variance in accuracy outcomes to select the most effective settings. This leverages statistical decision-making to optimize beyond default values.
- Core assumption: Accuracy variance across parameter settings correlates with the best generalization performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...we explore different settings for the selected learning rate policies to find the appropriate policies through a statistical-based decision."
  - [section] "Its key idea is to vary these values (i.e., especially for B and Vth as summarized in Table I) and observe their impact on accuracy."
  - [corpus] No direct support found; statistical method not detailed in neighbors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spiking Neural Network (SNN) training with surrogate gradients
  - Why needed here: FastSpiker trains SNNs on event-based data; understanding STBP (Spatio-Temporal Back-Propagation) is critical to modify or debug learning rate schedules.
  - Quick check question: What surrogate function is typically used to approximate gradients for the non-differentiable spike function in SNNs?

- Concept: Event-based data representation (DVS events)
  - Why needed here: NCARS dataset consists of asynchronous event streams; preprocessing and normalization directly affect learning rate sensitivity.
  - Quick check question: How do you convert raw event streams (x, y, t, p) into a format suitable for a 100x100 pixel SNN input?

- Concept: Learning rate policy taxonomy (step, decay, cyclical, warm restart)
  - Why needed here: FastSpiker compares six policies; knowing their dynamics (e.g., reset timing, bounds) is required to adjust hyperparameters correctly.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between cyclical and warm restart policies in terms of LR trajectory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data loader -> Event preprocessing -> SNN model (LIF + STBP) -> LR scheduler -> Optimizer -> Accuracy monitor -> Carbon emission estimator

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess NCARS events
  2. Train SNN with baseline LR policy to determine effective LR range
  3. Evaluate all LR policies; select those meeting stability threshold fastest
  4. Grid-search parameter settings (B, Vth) for selected policies
  5. Final training with optimized policy and settings

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LR range selection trades off exploration vs. speed; too narrow risks missing optimal LRs
  - Batch size affects stability and carbon emission; larger batches speed training but may reduce generalization
  - Stability threshold balances early stopping vs. over-training; 1% std dev may be dataset-specific

- Failure signatures:
  - Oscillating accuracy despite LR changes -> LR range or policy choice ineffective
  - Stagnant accuracy with low variance -> Learning rate too low or model capacity insufficient
  - High variance across parameter settings -> Insufficient statistical power in grid search

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline SOTA DS policy with varied LRs (1e-6 to 1e-1) to plot accuracy vs. LR and confirm effective range
  2. Implement exponential decay and warm restarts policies; train each to measure time to first stability
  3. Perform parameter sweep over B (20, 30, 40) and Vth (0.3, 0.4, 0.5) for selected policies; analyze variance in final accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different initial learning rate values impact the stability and speed of convergence in SNN training on event-based data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that different initial LR values may lead to different responses in terms of learning curves at the early training phase, with significant fluctuations observed for some policies.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions the observation but does not provide a systematic study of how varying initial LR values affects the training dynamics and final accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying the initial LR across a wide range for each policy, measuring both convergence speed and final accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the FastSpiker methodology be generalized to other types of event-based datasets beyond NCARS, such as gesture recognition or neuromorphic vision tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology is tested only on the NCARS automotive dataset, leaving its applicability to other domains unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the robustness or adaptability of the methodology to different event-based datasets with varying characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying FastSpiker to multiple event-based datasets (e.g., gesture, DVS vision) and comparing its effectiveness across domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of batch size and neuron threshold potential on the effectiveness of learning rate policies in SNNs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores different combinations of batch size and threshold potential values in Section III-C, but does not provide a detailed analysis of their individual or combined effects on learning rate policy performance.
- Why unresolved: While combinations are tested, the specific influence of each parameter on policy effectiveness is not isolated or explained.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation study varying batch size and threshold potential independently to quantify their impact on training speed and accuracy for each LR policy.

## Limitations

- Optimal LR range (1e-5–1e-2) and stability threshold (1%) may not generalize across different event-based datasets or network architectures
- Carbon emission calculations rely on GPU power consumption estimates that could vary significantly between hardware generations
- Methodology tested only on NCARS automotive dataset, limiting generalizability to other event-based domains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodology of systematically exploring LR ranges and policies is sound and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The specific LR range (1e-5–1e-2) and stability threshold (1%) are effective for NCARS but may require recalibration for other datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The 10.5x speedup and 88.39% emission reduction claims are dataset-specific and depend on hardware configurations

## Next Checks

1. Test FastSpiker's LR range determination on a different event-based dataset (e.g., DVS128 Gesture Dataset) to verify range generalizability
2. Compare FastSpiker's carbon emission calculations against direct hardware power monitoring on the same GPU setup
3. Implement the statistical parameter selection (B and Vth) with cross-validation to assess whether variance-based decisions consistently select optimal settings across multiple runs
