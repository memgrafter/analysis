# Multigenre AI-powered Story Composition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06685
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes using genre patterns as scaffolding for interactive narrative generation to enforce thematic consistency.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for generating interactive stories that remain thematically consistent by guiding composition with genre-specific narrative structures. The authors identify five fundamental genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire, mystery) and construct genre patterns using most specific generalization over example narratives. The PatternTeller prototype enables users to generate stories from a given premise, with each story developed under the guidance of the chosen genre pattern while accommodating user suggestions. This approach aims to balance creative freedom with genre coherence in interactive storytelling.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-phase process to construct genre patterns: first retrieving three example narratives per genre that match specific characterizations, then applying most specific generalization to extract common structural elements. PatternTeller uses these patterns to guide story generation, expanding each pattern stage into concrete scenes through LLM generation conditioned on the current context and genre expectations. The system allows user interaction at each composition stage, enabling feedback and modifications while maintaining thematic consistency within the genre framework.

## Key Results
- Genre patterns successfully guide interactive story composition while preserving thematic consistency.
- The two-phase pattern construction process (retrieval + generalization) effectively captures genre-specific narrative structures.
- PatternTeller accommodates user suggestions during story composition without breaking genre constraints.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using genre patterns as scaffolding ensures thematic consistency by constraining narrative structure to genre-specific templates.
- Mechanism: The system constructs genre patterns by generalizing three example narratives per genre, then guides story generation by mapping user-provided premises into these patterns, ensuring events and character arcs conform to genre expectations.
- Core assumption: Genre-specific narrative patterns capture sufficient thematic and structural features to enforce consistency across diverse story premises.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "guide interactive story composition in a way that enforces thematic consistency."
  - [section] "most specific generalization to the groups of examples in order to find their commonalities."
  - [corpus] Weak/no direct evidence; ALHD dataset uses genre for LLM detection but not for narrative generation scaffolding.
- Break condition: If user premises are too divergent from pattern examples, or if the pattern is overly generalized, thematic consistency may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PatternTeller's recursive scene generation maintains narrative coherence by iteratively expanding each pattern stage into concrete story events.
- Mechanism: At each stage of a genre pattern, PatternTeller uses the LLM to generate scene content conditioned on both the current stage's description and the evolving story context, preserving logical flow and genre tone.
- Core assumption: The LLM can reliably interpret abstract pattern stage descriptions into coherent, contextually appropriate scenes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "offering the opportunity to generate stories from a given premise of the user, to be developed under the guidance of the chosen pattern."
  - [section] "used the PatternTeller prototype to create new stories from the same premise."
  - [corpus] Weak; CreAgentive also uses agent workflows for creative generation but does not detail stage-wise conditioning.
- Break condition: LLM generation failures or stage misalignment can break coherence, especially if stage descriptions are too vague.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: User interaction at each composition stage enables interactive, genre-consistent storytelling while accommodating creative input.
- Mechanism: After generating a scene, PatternTeller prompts the user for feedback or modifications before proceeding to the next stage, allowing iterative refinement within the genre framework.
- Core assumption: Users can meaningfully influence story direction without violating genre constraints, and LLM can incorporate feedback without derailing thematic consistency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "trying to accommodate the user's suggestions along the composition stages."
  - [section] "allowing the prototype to run the process as it pleased, with occasional requests for the regeneration of the scene illustrations."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; Toyteller allows user manipulation of character symbols but not structured genre-stage interaction.
- Break condition: Excessive user deviation or conflicting feedback may force the system to abandon genre constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Most specific generalization (MSG)
  - Why needed here: MSG is the core technique used to extract common narrative structures from example stories to form genre patterns.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes most specific generalization from least general generalization in pattern extraction?

- Concept: Genre as narrative constraint
  - Why needed here: Understanding how genres encode expectations about plot, tone, and character behavior is essential to applying genre patterns effectively.
  - Quick check question: How do the five chosen genres differ in their treatment of world justice and protagonist fate?

- Concept: Pattern-stage mapping
  - Why needed here: Knowing how abstract pattern stages (e.g., "Call to Adventure") map to concrete story elements ensures correct story generation flow.
  - Quick check question: In the romance genre pattern, which stage corresponds to the hero's ultimate triumph and return home?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - User interface: Premise input, genre selection, scene feedback
  - PatternTeller core: Pattern storage, stage expansion, scene generation
  - LLM backend: GPT-4-turbo for pattern construction and GPT-3.5 for scene generation
  - Stable Diffusion integration: Scene illustration generation (optional)
- Critical path:
  1. User submits premise and selects genre
  2. PatternTeller loads corresponding pattern
  3. For each stage: LLM generates scene text; user optionally edits
  4. After final stage: Compile storyboard with illustrations
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed genre set vs. extensible genre library (simplicity vs. flexibility)
  - Three examples per pattern vs. more (speed vs. generality)
  - LLM-based generation vs. rule-based (expressiveness vs. control)
- Failure signatures:
  - Scene text off-topic or incoherent → LLM conditioning or prompt issue
  - Pattern stages not applicable to premise → Premise-pattern mismatch
  - Illustrations inconsistent → Stable Diffusion prompt engineering needed
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run PatternTeller with a simple premise and the comedy genre; verify each stage generates coherent scenes.
  2. Try modifying a generated scene and observe if the next stage adapts appropriately.
  3. Test the same premise across two different genres; compare thematic consistency and narrative differences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM-based generalization may lead to oversimplified or overgeneralized patterns that fail to capture full genre nuance.
- Evaluation is primarily qualitative with no systematic user study or quantitative measure of thematic consistency or user satisfaction.
- The approach may struggle when user inputs conflict with genre expectations or when premises are highly divergent from example narratives.

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1**: Medium - Method is sound but lacks empirical validation and pattern construction details are unspecified.
- **Mechanism 2**: Low - Stage-wise conditioning is described conceptually but not demonstrated or evaluated.
- **Mechanism 3**: Medium - User interaction concept is plausible but effectiveness without breaking genre constraints is unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Pattern Robustness Test**: Systematically vary the number of example narratives used to construct each genre pattern (e.g., 3, 5, 7 examples) and evaluate how well the resulting patterns preserve genre-specific features.

2. **User Deviation Stress Test**: Conduct a controlled experiment where users intentionally provide conflicting feedback at different stages, and measure whether the system can maintain thematic consistency or gracefully degrade.

3. **Premise-Pattern Alignment Analysis**: Test the system with premises that are increasingly divergent from the example narratives used to construct the genre patterns, and quantify the drop in thematic consistency using human raters or automated metrics.
