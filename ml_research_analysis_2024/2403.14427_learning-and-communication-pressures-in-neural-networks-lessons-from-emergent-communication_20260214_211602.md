# Learning and communication pressures in neural networks: Lessons from emergent communication

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14427
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14427
- Authors: Lukas Galke; Limor Raviv
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: The paper reviews emergent communication research to understand language learning and evolution in neural networks. It identifies key pressures shaping emergent languages: communicative success, efficiency, learnability, and psycho-/sociolinguistic factors. The authors demonstrate how introducing theory-driven inductive biases can resolve mismatches between emergent neural languages and human languages, making them more linguistically plausible. They argue that insights from emergent communication can inform the development of more cognitively plausible language models for language acquisition and evolution research.

## Executive Summary
This paper synthesizes research on emergent communication in neural networks to understand how artificial agents develop communication protocols and what this reveals about language evolution. The authors review how neural agents, when trained to communicate without pre-training on human language data, initially develop communication protocols that differ from human languages in key properties like compositionality and efficiency. By systematically introducing theory-driven inductive biases that reflect pressures present in human language evolution, the authors demonstrate that emergent neural languages can be made more linguistically plausible and human-like.

The work bridges two fields - emergent communication research and language acquisition/evolution studies - arguing that neural agents can serve as models for understanding language emergence when appropriate cognitive pressures are incorporated. The paper identifies four key pressures (communicative success, efficiency, learnability, and psycho-/sociolinguistic factors) that shape both human and emergent languages, and shows how these pressures can be operationalized through specific training objectives and architectural choices in neural network communication games.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic review methodology, analyzing existing research on emergent communication in neural networks. The authors examine how neural agents develop communication protocols in sender-receiver games, comparing emergent language properties to those of human languages. They identify mismatches between emergent and human languages and review studies that introduced specific inductive biases to resolve these mismatches. The methodology involves theoretical analysis of existing experimental results rather than conducting new experiments, synthesizing findings across multiple studies to identify generalizable principles about language emergence and evolution in artificial systems.

## Key Results
- Neural agents initially develop communication protocols that differ from human languages in compositionality, efficiency, and learnability properties
- Introducing theory-driven inductive biases (efficiency pressure, learnability pressure, sender-receiver role alternation) can make emergent neural languages more linguistically plausible
- Emergent communication research provides insights for developing cognitively plausible language models for language acquisition and evolution studies
- The four key pressures shaping both human and emergent languages are communicative success, efficiency, learnability, and psycho-/sociolinguistic factors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Theory-driven inductive biases resolve mismatches between emergent neural languages and human languages.
- Mechanism: By introducing specific pressures (communicative success, efficiency, learnability, psycho-/sociolinguistic factors) into neural network training, the resulting communication protocols develop properties more aligned with natural languages.
- Core assumption: Neural agents can develop linguistically plausible behaviors when appropriate inductive biases are introduced, even without pre-training on human language data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The authors demonstrate how introducing theory-driven inductive biases can resolve mismatches between emergent neural languages and human languages, making them more linguistically plausible."
  - [section] "Crucially, although the emergent languages of neural networks initially did not exhibit many of the linguistic properties typically associated with human languages, most of these differences could be reconciled by adding adequate inductive biases"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighbor papers focus on different aspects of emergent communication, not specifically on the resolution of mismatches through inductive biases
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the introduced biases conflict with the core communication objective or if the biases are not grounded in actual human linguistic behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learnability pressure is crucial for the emergence of compositional structure in neural network communication protocols.
- Mechanism: By introducing periodic parameter resets or other mechanisms that simulate the learning pressure of language transmission across generations, neural agents develop more compositional communication protocols.
- Core assumption: Compositionality emerges as a learned adaptation that facilitates both learning and generalization, similar to human language evolution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Based on our review, a pressure for learnability (or continual re-learning) also governs the development of communication protocols between neural network agents."
  - [section] "It is probably the case that there was not really a mismatch between humans and neural agents in the first place" - regarding compositionality and generalization
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighbor papers explore compositionality but don't directly address learnability pressure as the key mechanism
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if compositionality emerges without learnability pressure, or if learnability pressure alone is insufficient to drive compositional structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Efficiency pressure (laziness and impatience) recovers Zipf's Law of Abbreviation in emergent communication.
- Mechanism: By penalizing longer messages for senders (laziness) and encouraging early inference for receivers (impatience), the communication protocol naturally develops shorter forms for more frequent concepts, mirroring human language patterns.
- Core assumption: The principle of least effort is a fundamental driver of linguistic structure that can be effectively modeled in neural agents through appropriate training objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The mismatch with human language was resolved by adjusting the optimization objective in a direction that made sender agents 'lazy' (i.e., longer messages were penalized) and receiver agents 'impatient' (i.e., receivers tried to infer the meaning as early as possible in a sequential read)"
  - [section] "This inductive bias, which aims at mimicking real human behavior during language production and comprehension, has recovered Zipf's Law of Abbreviation"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighbor papers don't specifically address Zipf's Law or efficiency pressure in the context of emergent communication
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if efficiency pressure leads to communication failure or if other pressures override the efficiency bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Emergent communication
  - Why needed here: Understanding how neural agents develop communication protocols without pre-training on human language is fundamental to the paper's framework
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes emergent communication from standard language model pre-training?
- Concept: Inductive biases in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument is that introducing specific inductive biases can make neural communication more human-like
  - Quick check question: How do inductive biases differ from the inherent training objective in neural networks?
- Concept: Compositionality in language
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses how compositional structure emerges (or fails to emerge) in neural communication protocols
  - Quick check question: Why is compositional structure considered a hallmark of human language, and what advantage does it provide?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Sender agent: Conditional generation model that produces messages from input
  - Receiver agent: Inference model that decodes messages to reconstruct input
  - Communication channel: Can be discrete (symbols) or continuous (vectors)
  - Training objective: Typically communicative success, but can include efficiency and learnability pressures
  - Inductive biases: Additional constraints or objectives to shape communication behavior
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize sender and receiver agents with random parameters
  2. Train agents to communicate successfully using the chosen objective
  3. Introduce inductive biases to resolve mismatches with human language properties
  4. Evaluate emergent communication protocols against linguistic benchmarks
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Discrete vs. continuous communication channels affect the type of linguistic properties that can emerge
  - Strong efficiency pressure may reduce communicative success
  - Complex inductive biases may make training unstable or require more data
- Failure signatures:
  - Communication protocols remain random or non-systematic
  - Agents develop efficient but non-compositional communication
  - Introduced biases lead to degenerate solutions (e.g., always sending the same message)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic sender-receiver communication game without any inductive biases to establish baseline behavior
  2. Add efficiency pressure (message length penalty) and observe changes in message length distribution
  3. Introduce periodic parameter resets to simulate learnability pressure and measure changes in compositional structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different memory constraints in neural networks affect the emergence of language structure compared to humans?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how neural networks have virtually no memory constraints due to over-parametrization, unlike humans who have limited memory capacity that affects language evolution and diversity.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that simply reducing model parameters to the theoretical minimum is not feasible, as over-parametrization is critical for the success of deep neural networks. However, it is unclear how to introduce memory constraints that mimic human language learning and evolution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental studies that systematically vary memory constraints in neural network architectures and measure their impact on language structure emergence and diversity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific learning biases that underlie the learnability advantage of compositional languages in neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that learnability pressures are crucial for compositional structure to emerge in neural networks, but the specific learning biases are not well understood. It questions how these biases translate into language learning in the real world and whether they differ between children and adults or across different levels of linguistic analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the need to understand the meaning and implications of different modeling choices when simulating language acquisition using language models and deep neural networks, but does not provide concrete answers on the nature of these learning biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies that identify and characterize the specific learning biases in neural networks that contribute to the learnability advantage of compositional languages, and compare them to known human learning biases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the inductive biases that promote human-like language emergence in neural networks be consolidated into a unified approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that several inductive biases have been introduced to resolve mismatches between neural agents and humans, such as population heterogeneity, laziness and impatience, and sender-receiver ties. However, it states that there is no unified approach that consolidates all these resolutions.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that merging these techniques could be a promising direction for future work, but does not provide a concrete unified approach or evaluate the combined effects of these biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research that develops and tests a unified approach that combines the various inductive biases mentioned in the paper, and evaluates its effectiveness in promoting human-like language emergence in neural networks.

## Limitations

- The paper primarily synthesizes existing research rather than presenting new empirical findings, making it difficult to assess the strength of evidence for specific mechanisms
- Many claims about "resolving mismatches" between emergent and human languages are based on theoretical arguments rather than systematic comparative studies
- The effectiveness of proposed inductive biases may vary significantly depending on task complexity, agent architectures, and training regimes

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general framework that emergent communication can inform language acquisition/evolution research; the identification of key pressures (communicative success, efficiency, learnability)
- **Medium confidence**: Specific claims about which inductive biases resolve which mismatches; the universality of proposed mechanisms across different communication tasks
- **Low confidence**: Quantitative assessments of how "linguistically plausible" emergent languages become after introducing biases; the claim that neural agents can serve as direct models for human language evolution

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic ablation studies testing each proposed inductive bias independently to establish which pressures are necessary versus sufficient for specific linguistic properties
2. Design comparative experiments between emergent communication protocols and actual human languages across multiple typological dimensions (not just compositionality and Zipf's law)
3. Implement cross-task validation by testing whether emergent communication protocols trained in one domain (e.g., reference games) transfer to others (e.g., negotiation or storytelling), assessing the generalizability of proposed mechanisms
