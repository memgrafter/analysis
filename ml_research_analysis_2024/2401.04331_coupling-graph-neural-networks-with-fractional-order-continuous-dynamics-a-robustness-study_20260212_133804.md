# Coupling Graph Neural Networks with Fractional Order Continuous Dynamics: A Robustness Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04331
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Graph neural FDE models maintain more stringent output perturbation bounds under adversarial attacks compared to integer-order counterparts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Graph Neural Fractional-Order Differential Equations (FROND) as a robust alternative to traditional graph neural ODE models. By implementing the time-fractional Caputo derivative, FROND models incorporate long-term memory during feature updates, diverging from the memoryless Markovian updates of conventional graph neural ODEs. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that FROND models achieve tighter output perturbation bounds and superior robustness accuracy against various adversarial attacks including graph modification and injection attacks.

## Method Summary
The authors extend three graph neural ODE models (GRAND, GraphBel, GraphCON) by replacing their integer-order derivatives with fractional-order Caputo derivatives. The fractional order β serves as a hyperparameter that controls the memory effects. The models are implemented using the fractional Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method for solving the differential equations. Experimental evaluation involves testing on benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed, Computers) under various attack scenarios with perturbation rates ranging from 0% to 25%, using a 60% train, 10% validation, 20% test split for GIA attacks.

## Key Results
- FROND models achieve tighter output perturbation bounds compared to integer-order counterparts under adversarial attacks
- Smaller β values (fractional order) lead to enhanced robustness in FROND models
- FROND models outperform existing graph neural ODE models in robustness accuracy under Metattack, PGD-GIA, TDGIA, and MetaGIA attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FROND models achieve tighter output perturbation bounds compared to integer-order counterparts under adversarial attacks.
- Mechanism: The Caputo fractional derivative introduces memory effects by integrating the entire historical trajectory of the function, allowing the model to mitigate the immediate effects of perturbations by incorporating past states into its response.
- Core assumption: The long-memory property of fractional derivatives provides a protective buffer against disturbances by integrating historical states rather than amplifying perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "They maintain more stringent output perturbation bounds in the face of input and graph topology disturbances, compared to their integer-order counterparts."
  - [section]: "The extensive memory of FROND serves as a protective buffer. It mitigates the immediate effects of these disruptions by integrating the system's past states into its response."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence available for this specific claim.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Smaller β values lead to enhanced robustness in FROND models.
- Mechanism: The Mittag-Leffler function Eβ(LTβ) increases monotonically with β, so smaller β values result in smaller perturbation bounds, indicating better robustness.
- Core assumption: The relationship between β and the Mittag-Leffler function is monotonic, with smaller β values corresponding to smaller perturbation bounds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our analysis suggests a monotonic relationship between the model's perturbation bounds and the parameter β, with smaller β values indicating augmented robustness."
  - [section]: "Theorem 3 shows that the fractional order β of the FROND plays a crucial role in the model's robustness. With an appropriately chosen β, the model can reduce the discrepancy between the clean and perturbed states."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence available for this specific claim.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FROND models can be integrated with existing graph neural ODE frameworks without additional training parameters.
- Mechanism: The fractional-order derivative is implemented as a hyperparameter β, which can be adjusted to adapt to specific data characteristics without requiring additional learnable parameters.
- Core assumption: The fractional-order derivative can be incorporated into existing graph neural ODE frameworks by treating β as a hyperparameter rather than a learnable parameter.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "FROND can effortlessly merge with existing graph neural ODE frameworks, potentially increasing their effectiveness, especially with diverse β values, without incorporating any additional training parameters to the underlying graph neural ODE models."
  - [section]: "The order β of these fractional derivatives serves as a hyperparameter, introducing extra flexibility to these models."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence available for this specific claim.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Fractional-order differential equation solver -> Graph neural ODE models (F-GRAND, F-GraphBel, F-GraphCON) -> Output layer
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize the FROND model with input node features and graph topology
  2. Solve the fractional-order differential equation using the fractional Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method
  3. Obtain the terminal node embeddings at time T
  4. Use the embeddings for downstream tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Smaller β values provide better robustness but may lead to oversmoothing
  - Larger β values capture more dynamics but may be more vulnerable to perturbations
  - Integrating FROND with existing graph neural ODE frameworks without additional parameters simplifies implementation but may limit flexibility
- Failure signatures:
  - If the model fails to converge or produces unstable results, check the choice of β and the numerical solver settings
  - If the model is too smooth or loses important structural information, consider increasing β
  - If the model is still vulnerable to attacks, explore integrating FROND with additional defense mechanisms
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the robustness of F-GRAND, F-GraphBel, and F-GraphCON on the Cora dataset under Metattack with varying perturbation rates (0% to 25%)
  2. Compare the performance of FROND models with their integer-order counterparts (GRAND, GraphBel, GraphCON) on the Citeseer dataset under GIA attacks (PGD-GIA, TDGIA, MetaGIA)
  3. Investigate the impact of β on the robustness of F-GRAND by testing different β values (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) on the PubMed dataset under graph modification attacks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Open Question 1: How does the robustness of graph neural FDE models (FROND) change when the fractional order β approaches 1?
- Open Question 2: Can the FROND framework be effectively combined with other defense mechanisms beyond adversarial training and pre-processing?
- Open Question 3: How do the robustness characteristics of FROND models generalize to graphs with different properties, such as heterophilic graphs or graphs with varying node degrees?

## Limitations
- The paper's theoretical claims rely heavily on assumptions about the monotonic relationship between fractional order β and perturbation bounds, though empirical validation is limited to specific datasets and attack scenarios
- Implementation details of the numerical solver for fractional differential equations are not fully specified, which could affect reproducibility
- The paper does not address potential computational overhead introduced by the fractional calculus operations compared to traditional integer-order methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core claim that FROND models maintain more stringent output perturbation bounds under adversarial attacks is supported by both theoretical analysis (Theorem 3) and experimental results across multiple datasets and attack scenarios
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that smaller β values lead to enhanced robustness is theoretically sound based on the Mittag-Leffler function properties, but the optimal choice of β may be dataset-dependent and requires further exploration
- **Low confidence**: The claim that FROND models can be integrated with existing graph neural ODE frameworks without additional training parameters, while appealing, may oversimplify the practical challenges of implementation and hyperparameter tuning

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test FROND models on additional graph datasets (e.g., Reddit, Amazon) to verify the robustness claims generalize beyond the three datasets used in the paper
2. **β sensitivity analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive study varying β from 0.1 to 0.9 in 0.1 increments across different graph structures and attack types to quantify the robustness-accuracy trade-off
3. **Computational efficiency comparison**: Measure and compare the training/inference time and memory requirements of FROND models against their integer-order counterparts to assess practical feasibility for large-scale applications
